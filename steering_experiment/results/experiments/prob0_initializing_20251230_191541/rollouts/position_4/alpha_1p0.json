Using the binomial theorem, each term will be \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\\) where \\(k\\) goes from 0 to 4. So, the terms would be:\n\n- When \\(k = 0\\): \\(\\dbinom{4}{0}a^4b^0 = 1 \\cdot a^4 \\cdot 1 = a^4\\)\n- When \\(k = 1\\): \\(\\dbinom{4}{1}a^3b^1 = 4a^3b\\)\n- When \\(k = 2\\): \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\\)\n- When \\(k = 3\\): \\(\\dbinom{4}{3}a^1b^3 = 4ab^3\\)\n- When \\(k = 4\\): \\(\\dbinom{4}{4}a^0b^4 = 1 \\cdot 1 \\cdot b^4 = b^4\\)\n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. But wait, that's just the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\). The original problem has another part: \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the entire expression is the product of these two expansions. That means I need to multiply each term from \\((a + b)^4\\) with each term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) and find the coefficient where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2.\n\nBut actually, the question is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, maybe I don't need to worry about the \\(c\\) terms? Wait, no. Because the entire expression is the product of \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), when I multiply them, each term from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term from the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term from the second part, which are in terms of \\(c\\).\n\nBut the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so maybe I just need to consider the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and then multiply it by the entire second part? Wait, no, that doesn't make sense because the second part is in terms of \\(c\\), which is a different variable. So, when I multiply, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nWait, but that would mean the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all the terms in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which doesn't seem right because when you multiply by each term, you would get different powers of \\(c\\). But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so I think it's just 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't make sense because the problem is likely expecting a numerical coefficient, not an expression in terms of \\(c\\). Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating this.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, in other words, when you expand the entire expression, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will have a coefficient that is the product of the coefficients from each part. So, the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and then the coefficient from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is... wait, no, because the \\(c\\) terms are separate. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't seem right either.\n\nWait, no. Let me think again. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When you multiply two expressions, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), that term is present only in \\((a + b)^4\\), and it's multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 (from \\(a^2b^2\\)) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is 6 times a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Maybe it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, but that seems odd because \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) are separate. Alternatively, maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\). That would make sense because then it's a specific term.\n\nSo, perhaps I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product. Let me check the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" Hmm, it doesn't specify anything about \\(c\\), so maybe it's just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. But that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which would be a polynomial, not a single number. That can't be right.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable, but only considering the terms where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out, i.e., \\(c^0\\). So, in other words, the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\). That would make sense because then the coefficient would be a number. So, I think that's what the problem is asking for.\n\nSo, to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), I need to consider the product of the terms from each expansion. From \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. From \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\), because when I multiply it by \\(a^2b^2\\), I want the exponent of \\(c\\) to be zero. So, first, let's find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nTo do that, I can use the binomial theorem again. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We want the exponent of \\(c\\) to be 0, so we set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\).\n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, the term is \\(20c^0 = 20\\).\n\nNow, putting it all together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product is the product of the coefficients from each part, which is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not missing anything. The problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", and I interpreted it as \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). But maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which would mean it's 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial. But that can't be because the problem is likely expecting a single numerical answer. So, I think my initial interpretation is correct: the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nLet me double-check. If I expand \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. Then, expanding \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. So, when I multiply these two expansions together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second part, but only the term with \\(c^0\\) will contribute to \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). Therefore, the coefficient is indeed 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nSo, I think that's the answer. The coefficient is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6. Then, we find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20. Multiplying these together gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\boxed{120}."

    "text": " \n\nLet me focus on the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\). If I expand this, each term will be of the form \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\\) where \\(k\\) goes from 0 to 4. I'm specifically looking for the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2, right? So, that would be when \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). Let me check: \\(4 - 2 = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\), so yes, that's the term I need. \n\nSo, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient is 6. \n\nBut wait, the problem isn't just \\((a + b)^4\\), it's multiplied by another expression: \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I need to consider how that affects the coefficient. Let me think about this. \n\nI suppose that when I multiply two expressions together, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression. But since I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and that term doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), maybe the coefficient remains the same regardless of the other terms. \n\nWait, no, that doesn't seem right. Because the problem is asking for the coefficient in the entire product, so actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the same as in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient would just be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nWait, no, that's not correct either. Because when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficients of the terms in the product are the products of the coefficients of the terms being multiplied. So, if I have a term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part and any term from the second part, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times any term in the second polynomial would actually be \\(6 \\times\\) the coefficient of that term in the second polynomial. But since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term without \\(c\\), the coefficient in the product would actually be 6 multiplied by the entire sum of the coefficients of the second polynomial. \n\nWait, but actually, no. Because when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) will be multiplied by terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second part, which are of the form \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). \n\nBut wait, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\). So, in the product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by each term in the second polynomial, each of which has some power of \\(c\\). But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I think we're only considering the coefficient of the term \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. \n\nWait, no, that can't be right because the problem is written as \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), so when you expand it, the entire product will have terms involving both \\(a, b\\) and \\(c\\). So, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), it's considering all possible terms that have \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) would be multiplied by 6, and then you add them all up. \n\nBut wait, no, that's not quite right. Because when you multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) contributes to the coefficient when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). \n\nWait, but actually, the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, does that mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times 64, which is 384? Hmm, that seems high. Let me check that again.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think differently. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are independent of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, it's actually the coefficient in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion, so the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nBut wait, the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is indeed found by substituting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 \u00d7 64 = 384. Hmm, that seems plausible, but I'm not entirely sure. Let me see if there's another way to approach this.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can consider that when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term is the sum of the products of coefficients of terms whose exponents add up to that term. But in this case, since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 6 \u00d7 64 = 384. \n\nWait, but I'm not sure if that's correct because when you multiply polynomials, the coefficients of the product are the convolutions of the coefficients of the factors. So, in this case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 6 \u00d7 64 = 384. \n\nBut let me verify this. Let's take a simpler example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, expanding \\((a + b)^2\\) gives \\(a^2 + 2ab + b^2\\). Expanding \\((c + 1/c)^1\\) gives \\(c + 1/c\\). Now, multiplying these together: each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) would be 1 (from \\(a^2\\)) multiplied by the sum of coefficients in the second polynomial, which is \\(1 + 1 = 2\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) in the product would be 1 \u00d7 2 = 2. Similarly, the coefficient of \\(ab\\) would be 2 \u00d7 2 = 4, and the coefficient of \\(b^2\\) would be 1 \u00d7 2 = 2. \n\nWait, but in this case, the terms involving \\(c\\) would be \\(a^2c\\), \\(a^2/c\\), \\(2ab c\\), \\(2ab/c\\), \\(b^2c\\), \\(b^2/c\\). So, if I were to ask for the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), it would actually be the sum of the coefficients of all terms involving \\(a^2\\), which would be 1 \u00d7 (1 + 1) = 2, which matches. Similarly, for \\(ab\\), it's 2 \u00d7 (1 + 1) = 4, and for \\(b^2\\), it's 1 \u00d7 2 = 2. \n\nSo, applying this logic back to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). \n\nNow, the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is found by substituting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). \n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 \u00d7 64 = 384. \n\nWait, but let me check this another way. Alternatively, I can think of the entire expression as a product of two independent polynomials, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and the sum of all coefficients in the second part. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can think of it as the product of the two polynomials, and the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the same as in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of the second part. But since the second part is multiplied by the first, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would indeed be 6 \u00d7 64 = 384. \n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because sometimes when you have variables involved, the coefficients might not just multiply directly. Let me try another approach. \n\nLet me consider the entire expression as \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). When I expand this, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, which are of the form \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). \n\nBut since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), that means we're considering all possible terms where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2 each, and the exponents of \\(c\\) can be anything. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which is 64. Therefore, the coefficient would be 6 \u00d7 64 = 384. \n\nWait, but let me confirm this with an example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\), as before. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^0\\) is 1, and when multiplied by \\((c + 1/c)\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) in the product would be 1 \u00d7 (1 + 1) = 2, which is correct because the terms would be \\(a^2c\\) and \\(a^2/c\\), each with coefficient 1, so the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) is 2. Similarly, for \\(ab\\), the coefficient is 2, and when multiplied by \\((c + 1/c)\\), it becomes 2 \u00d7 2 = 4, which is correct because you have \\(2ab c\\) and \\(2ab/c\\), each with coefficient 2, so total coefficient 4. \n\nSo, applying this logic, in the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would indeed be 6 \u00d7 64 = 384. \n\nWait, but I'm still a bit unsure. Let me think differently. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). If I consider this as a product of two polynomials, then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), because each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). \n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 \u00d7 64 = 384. \n\nWait, but another way to think about it is that when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a term in the product is the sum of the products of coefficients of terms whose exponents add up to that term. But in this case, since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the exponents of \\(c\\) can be anything, so the coefficient would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial. \n\nSo, yes, that would be 6 \u00d7 64 = 384. \n\nWait, but let me check the calculation again. The sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is indeed \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\), because substituting \\(c = 1\\) gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). \n\nAnd the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). So, 6 \u00d7 64 = 384. \n\nI think that's correct. So, the coefficient is 384. \n\nWait, but just to be thorough, let me consider expanding both parts and see how the terms interact. \n\nFirst, \\((a + b)^4\\) expands to \\(a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). \n\nNext, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) expands to \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(1/c\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). \n\nSo, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. \n\nSo, when I multiply \\(6a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, I get \\(6a^2b^2 \\times \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). \n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 \u00d7 64 = 384. \n\nYes, that makes sense. So, the coefficient is 384. \n\nI think I've convinced myself that this is the correct approach. So, the final answer is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is found using the binomial theorem: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). The entire expression is then multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), whose sum of coefficients is 64 when \\(c = 1\\). Thus, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n\\boxed{384}"

That means I need to find the term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) where \\(a\\) is squared and \\(b\\) is also squared. Let me write out the expansion for \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem. \n\nSo, \\((a + b)^4 = \\dbinom{4}{0}a^4b^0 + \\dbinom{4}{1}a^3b^1 + \\dbinom{4}{2}a^2b^2 + \\dbinom{4}{3}a^1b^3 + \\dbinom{4}{4}a^0b^4\\). \n\nLooking at this, the term with \\(a^2b^2\\) is the third term, which is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}a^2b^2\\).

Since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nWait, no, that might not be quite right. Actually, when you multiply two expressions together, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and since the second expression involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), which are different variables, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term doesn't involve \\(c\\) at all. So, does that mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is just 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)? \n\nWait, that doesn't seem right because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not considering \\(c\\). Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think again. \n\nSo, the expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When you multiply these two, each term from \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term from the second part. \n\nBut the question is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression will be the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nWait, but that would mean the coefficient is 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, not an expression. Hmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. \n\nWait, no, perhaps I should consider that the question is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, treating \\(c\\) as another variable. So, when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), you get a product where each term is a product of a term from the first expansion and a term from the second. \n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems like it would give an expression, not a single coefficient. \n\nWait, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, in other words, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't seem right either because the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) vary depending on the power of \\(c\\). \n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think differently. Maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, so the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times each coefficient from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that would mean that the coefficient isn't a single number but rather a polynomial in \\(c\\). \n\nWait, but the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so perhaps it's considering the entire product and just wants the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). That is, it's treating \\(c\\) as an independent variable, so \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), so the coefficient would be 6 times each term from the second expansion. \n\nBut that would mean the coefficient isn't a single number but a sum of terms involving \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for a coefficient, which is a number, so maybe I'm misunderstanding the question. \n\nWait, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when considering all terms, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. But that doesn't make sense because the \\(c\\) terms are separate. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating \\(c\\) as a constant. But that doesn't seem right either because \\(c\\) is a variable. \n\nWait, perhaps I should think of it as a product of two separate expansions, and the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial in \\(c\\). \n\nBut the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, so maybe I'm missing something. Wait, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, meaning that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nWait, the sum of all the coefficients in a polynomial is found by plugging in 1 for all variables. So, if I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = (1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times 64, which is 384. \n\nWait, but I'm not sure if that's the correct approach. Let me think again. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, without considering the \\(c\\) terms, which would mean that the coefficient is just 6, because the \\(c\\) terms are separate. But that doesn't seem right either because the entire product would have terms involving \\(c\\) as well. \n\nWait, perhaps I should consider that the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by every term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times each term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), not a single number. \n\nBut the problem is asking for the coefficient, which is a number, so maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Wait, perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and not considering the other part. But that seems unlikely because the expression includes both parts. \n\nWait, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some \\(k\\), but the problem statement just says \\(a^2b^2\\), so perhaps it's considering the entire product and just wants the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. \n\nWait, but that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial, not a single coefficient. So, perhaps the problem is phrased incorrectly, or maybe I'm misinterpreting it. \n\nWait, let me read the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, perhaps it's considering the entire product and just wants the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which would be a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for a coefficient, which is a number, so maybe I'm missing something. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating \\(c\\) as a variable, so the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem says \"the coefficient,\" implying a single number, so perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. \n\nWait, maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when expanding the entire expression, which would be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). As I thought earlier, the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\(2^6 = 64\\). So, 6 times 64 is 384. \n\nBut let me check that again. If I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = (1 + 1)^6 = 64\\), which is the sum of all coefficients in that expansion. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times 64, which is 384. \n\nWait, but is that correct? Let me think differently. Suppose I expand both parts separately and then multiply them. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times each term from the second part. So, that would mean the coefficient is 6 times each term from the second expansion, which is a polynomial in \\(c\\). \n\nBut the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, so perhaps it's considering the entire product and just wants the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\). But that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of the second part, which is a polynomial, not a number. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, considering all possible powers of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of the second part, which is a polynomial. But the problem is asking for a coefficient, which is a number, so perhaps I'm missing something. \n\nWait, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, without considering the \\(c\\) terms, which would mean that the coefficient is just 6. But that seems too simple, and the problem includes the second part, so maybe that's not it. \n\nWait, perhaps I should consider that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, which would involve terms from both parts. So, each term in the product is a product of a term from \\((a + b)^4\\) and a term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by each term from the second expansion, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times each term from the second expansion. \n\nBut again, that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), not a single number. So, perhaps the problem is phrased incorrectly, or maybe I'm misinterpreting it. \n\nWait, another approach: perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, and since \\(c\\) is a separate variable, the coefficient would just be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient is 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial, but the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, so maybe I'm missing something. \n\nWait, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, so the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, so perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. \n\nWait, perhaps I should think of it as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times any power of \\(c\\), so the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that's a polynomial, not a number. \n\nWait, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). As I thought earlier, the sum of coefficients is 64, so 6 times 64 is 384. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which is 6 times each term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), so the coefficient is 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nBut the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, so perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and the other part is irrelevant. But that seems unlikely because the problem includes both parts. \n\nWait, perhaps I should think of it as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, which is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient is 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial. \n\nBut the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, so perhaps I'm missing something. Maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, considering only the constant term with respect to \\(c\\). That is, the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. \n\nWait, that makes sense. So, the problem might be asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is the constant term with respect to \\(c\\). So, in that case, I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and multiply it by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nThat sounds plausible. So, let me try that approach. \n\nFirst, as before, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. \n\nNow, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). That is, the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. \n\nTo find that, I can use the binomial theorem on \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nSo, the expansion is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). \n\nWe need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, so we set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\). \n\nSo, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). \n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. \n\nNow, since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire product, it's the product of the coefficients from each part. So, 6 (from \\(a^2b^2\\)) times 20 (from \\(c^0\\)) gives 120. \n\nWait, that seems more reasonable. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, considering only the constant term with respect to \\(c\\), is 120. \n\nBut let me double-check that. \n\nSo, in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term with \\(c^0\\) is when \\(k = 3\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} c^{6 - 2*3} = \\dbinom{6}{3} c^0 = 20\\). \n\nThen, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) has coefficient 6. \n\nTherefore, when you multiply these two parts, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by 20 from the second part, giving a total coefficient of 6 * 20 = 120 for the term \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). \n\nSo, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), considering only the constant term with respect to \\(c\\), then the answer is 120. \n\nAlternatively, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then the coefficient would be 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial, but since the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, I think the intended interpretation is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. \n\nWait, but let me make sure. The problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", without specifying \\(c\\). So, perhaps it's considering the entire product and just wants the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). But that would mean that the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense as a numerical coefficient. \n\nTherefore, I think the intended interpretation is that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. \n\nSo, to summarize, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, considering only the constant term with respect to \\(c\\), is 120. \n\nI think that's the correct approach. So, the final answer is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplying it by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20. Therefore, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\boxed{120}."

    "text": " The problem is asking specifically for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so I think I just need to find the term where \\(a\\) is squared and \\(b\\) is squared in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\). \n\nLet me write that out. For \\((a + b)^4\\), the general term is \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\\). I need the term where \\(a^2b^2\\), so that would be when \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). So, plugging in \\(k = 2\\), the coefficient would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Let me compute that: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. \n\nBut wait, the original expression is \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, does that mean I have to consider the entire product? Hmm, but the problem is only asking about the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, maybe the other part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), doesn't affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) because it's only involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), not \\(a\\) or \\(b\\). \n\nLet me think about that. When you multiply two expressions together, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression. But since the second expression doesn't have any \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), the terms involving \\(a^2b^2\\) will just be multiplied by constants from the second expression. So, perhaps the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, no, that can't be right because each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. \n\nWait, so maybe the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that would mean it's multiplied by a sum of terms, which would change the coefficient. Hmm, that doesn't sound right. Alternatively, perhaps the coefficient is just 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that also doesn't seem correct because each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would actually be 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), not a single number. \n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me re-read the problem: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, in other words, when you expand the entire product, what is the coefficient for the term \\(a^2b^2\\) times whatever the \\(c\\) terms are. But in that case, the coefficient would actually be 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which would mean that the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient, so maybe it's just 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that doesn't seem right either.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), that is, the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\), effectively just the constant term in the \\(c\\) expansion. That might make sense because otherwise, the coefficient would be a function of \\(c\\), which isn't typical in such problems. So, perhaps I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\) in the entire product.\n\nIf that's the case, then I need to compute two things: first, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which I found to be 6, and then the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Then, the overall coefficient would be 6 multiplied by that \\(c^0\\) coefficient.\n\nSo, let me compute the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\).\n\nWe want the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). Wait, no, that's not correct. Wait, 6! is 720, 3! is 6, so 6!/(3!3!) = 720/(6\u00d76) = 720/36 = 20. So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20.\n\nTherefore, the overall coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 6 multiplied by 20, which is 120.\n\nWait, but let me check that again. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 20, so when you multiply the two expansions together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in the \\(c\\) expansion, but only the \\(c^0\\) term contributes to \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), so the coefficient is 6\u00d720=120. That seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem was just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, then it would be 6 times the entire \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) expansion, but that would make the coefficient a polynomial in \\(c\\), which is unlikely what the problem is asking for. So, I think the intended interpretation is that we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nLet me just recap to make sure I didn't miss anything. First, expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem, find the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\), which is 6. Then, expand \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) and find the constant term, which is 20. Multiply those together to get 120. That seems right.\n\nI don't think I made any mistakes in the calculations. The binomial coefficients were computed correctly, and the exponents for \\(c\\) were handled properly. So, I think the coefficient is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplying it by the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20. Therefore, the overall coefficient is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\boxed{120}"

Now, I need the term where \\(a^2b^2\\), which means \\(4 - k = 2\\) for the exponent of \\(a\\), so \\(k = 2\\). Therefore, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in this part is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Let me calculate that: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) for \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6.\n\nNow, the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I need to consider how this part affects the coefficient. Wait, but the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\). That means, regardless of what happens with the \\(c\\) terms, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression will just be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, no, actually, that's not quite right. Because when you multiply two expressions together, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), that means we just need to take the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) for \\(a^2b^2\\) and multiply it by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because when you multiply by 1 (since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\)), it doesn't change the coefficient. Wait, no, that can't be right because the entire expression is a product, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is independent of \\(c\\). Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating this.\n\nWait, actually, when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each polynomial. But in this case, since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, no, that's not correct because each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). However, since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is independent of \\(c\\), the coefficient will be 6 multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, the sum of all the coefficients in a polynomial is found by setting all variables to 1. So, if I set \\(c = 1\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), I get \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but that seems too straightforward. Let me double-check. Alternatively, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\). That would make more sense because otherwise, the coefficient would depend on the powers of \\(c\\). So, maybe I need to find the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\) in the entire expansion. That would mean I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and multiply it by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nYes, that makes more sense. So, first, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, as I found earlier. Now, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me think about that. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be 0, so we set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6*6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\).\n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it might be 384, but that was when considering the sum of all coefficients, which would be if I set \\(c = 1\\). But that approach was incorrect because the problem is likely asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), not \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\). So, the correct approach is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and multiply it by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part, resulting in 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nLet me confirm this by expanding both parts separately. For \\((a + b)^4\\), the expansion is \\(a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6. For \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the expansion includes terms like \\(c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15\\dfrac{1}{c^2} + 6\\dfrac{1}{c^4} + \\dfrac{1}{c^6}\\), so the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Therefore, when multiplying these two expansions, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second part, but only the term with \\(c^0\\) will contribute to \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), so the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nI think that makes sense. So, the final answer should be 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplying it by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20. Thus, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\boxed{120}"

So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6. \n\nNow, the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I guess I need to consider how this part affects the coefficient. Wait, but the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\).

Let me think about that. \n\nIf I'm only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), then the rest of the expression, which involves \\(c\\), doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. So, perhaps the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just the same as in the first part, which is 6, and then multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part? Wait, no, that can't be right because the second part is multiplied as a whole. Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating it.\n\nWait, no. Let me clarify. The expression is \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when you multiply these two expansions together, each term from the first expansion is multiplied by each term from the second expansion. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term from the first expansion, and we don't have any \\(c\\) terms in \\(a^2b^2\\), perhaps the coefficient remains as 6, and the rest of the terms involving \\(c\\) don't affect it. \n\nWait, that seems too straightforward. Let me check. So, if I have \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by something else, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire second expression, but since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient remains 6 times whatever the entire second part is, but that doesn't make sense because the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so maybe it's just 6. \n\nWait, but I feel like that's not correct because the second part is raised to the 6th power, which would have its own coefficients, but since we're only looking for \\(a^2b^2\\), perhaps the answer is just 6, and the \\(c\\) terms don't influence it. Let me think again. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm supposed to consider the entire expansion and find the coefficient, but since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would just be the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. But that would mean the coefficient is 6 times something, but that doesn't make sense because \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), so the coefficient shouldn't depend on \\(c\\). \n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me try to write it out. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). When you multiply these two, each term in the expansion will be a product of a term from \\((a + b)^4\\) and a term from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, for example, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by every term in the second expansion. But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term without \\(c\\), that would only happen if we multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by the term in the second expansion that has \\(c^0\\), because then the product would be \\(a^2b^2 \\times \\text{constant}\\), which would still be \\(a^2b^2\\) with a coefficient that includes that constant. \n\nSo, maybe I need to find the term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) that has \\(c^0\\), because that's the only term that, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), would give a term with \\(a^2b^2\\) and some coefficient. Then, the total coefficient would be 6 (from the first part) multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part. \n\nOkay, that makes sense. So, first, I found the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. Now, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). \n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), I can use the binomial theorem again. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(1/c\\right)^k\\). Simplifying that, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\times c^{-k} = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). \n\nWe want the exponent of \\(c\\) to be 0, so we set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). \n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). \n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion is 20. \n\nNow, going back to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficients from each part. That is, 6 (from \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion) multiplied by 20 (from \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion). \n\nSo, 6 times 20 is 120. \n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is 120. \n\nWait, let me just make sure I didn't make any mistakes. So, in the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6 because \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). \n\nIn the second part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term with \\(c^0\\) occurs when \\(k = 3\\), which gives \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). \n\nMultiplying these together, 6 times 20 is 120. \n\nI think that's correct.

    "text": " \n\nAlright, so the first part is \\((a + b)^4\\). Let me expand that. Using the binomial theorem, each term in the expansion will be \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\\) where \\(k\\) goes from 0 to 4. I need the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so I should find the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2. That means \\(4 - k = 2\\) for \\(a\\), so \\(k = 2\\). So, the coefficient here would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Let me calculate that: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\nNow, the second part of the expression is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Hmm, this also looks like a binomial expansion. So, using the binomial theorem again, each term will be \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Let me simplify that term. \\(\\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = c^{-m}\\), so the term becomes \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\cdot c^{-m} = \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). \n\nWait a minute, but in the original problem, I'm only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). That term is in the first part of the product, so when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), I'm essentially multiplying two polynomials. So, each term in the expansion will be a product of a term from the first expansion and a term from the second expansion. \n\nBut the thing is, the first expansion has terms with \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), while the second expansion has terms with \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). Since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are different variables, the terms from each expansion don't interfere with each other. That means, when I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I don't need to consider any terms from the second expansion because they involve \\(c\\), which is a different variable. \n\nWait, is that right? Let me think again. So, the entire expression is a product of two separate binomial expansions. So, when I multiply them, each term will be of the form (term from first expansion) * (term from second expansion). But since the variables are different, the only way to get a term with \\(a^2b^2\\) is to take the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first expansion and multiply it by any term from the second expansion. But since the second expansion has terms with \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), which are different variables, the product will have terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2c^{-k}\\), but not just \\(a^2b^2\\) by itself unless \\(k = 0\\). \n\nWait, but in the problem, it's just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, in the product, if I'm looking for terms where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2, then regardless of what happens with \\(c\\), those terms will have \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by some power of \\(c\\). But the problem is asking specifically for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would mean we're considering the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, right? Because \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term without any \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\). \n\nWait, but hold on. Let me clarify: the problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\". So, in the entire product, terms that have \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by any power of \\(c\\) would be part of the expansion. But since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term without \\(c\\), we're looking for the coefficient where the exponents of \\(c\\) are zero. Because if we have \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), unless \\(k = 0\\), it's not just \\(a^2b^2\\). So, to get \\(a^2b^2\\), we need to multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first expansion with the term in the second expansion that has \\(c^0\\), which is the constant term. \n\nSo, in other words, the coefficient we're looking for is the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nOkay, so I already found that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. Now, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let's work on that. \n\nUsing the binomial expansion, each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\cdot c^{-m} = \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, we need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be 0, which means \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). \n\nTherefore, the term where \\(m = 3\\) is the constant term. The coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Let me compute that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\).

First, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).

Because when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficients combine in a specific way. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the product of the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial and the constant term (the term with \\(c^0\\)) in the second polynomial. Because if you have \\(a^2b^2\\) times any term involving \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), it would result in a term like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2/c^k\\), which is not just \\(a^2b^2\\). So, actually, the only term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) that will contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the constant term, i.e., the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero.\n\nSo, that means I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Once I find that, I can multiply it by the coefficient 6 from the first part to get the final coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression.\n\nOkay, so let's find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Again, using the binomial theorem, the expansion is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\).\n\nWe need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\).\n\nCalculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficient from the first part (which is 6) and the constant term from the second part (which is 20). So, 6 multiplied by 20 is 120.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake here. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 20. When you multiply these two, you get 6 * 20 = 120. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120.\n\nAlternatively, to double-check, maybe I can think of it as the entire expression being \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). When expanding this product, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by the constant term in the second expansion, which is 20. So, the coefficient is indeed 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nI think that makes sense. So, the final answer should be 120.\n\nWait, just to make sure I didn't mix up anything, let me recap:\n\n1. Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem.\n2. Find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is 6.\n3. Expand \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) and find the constant term, which is 20.\n4. Multiply these two coefficients together: 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nYes, that seems correct. I don't think I made any mistakes here. So, I'm confident that the coefficient is 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem.\n\nFirst, consider the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\). Using the binomial theorem, the term with \\(a^2b^2\\) is given by:\n\\[\n\\binom{4}{2} a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\n\\]\nSo, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\nNext, we need to find the constant term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem, the expansion is:\n\\[\n\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\binom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\binom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n\\]\nWe need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, which occurs when \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(k = 3\\). The constant term is:\n\\[\n\\binom{6}{3} = 20\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficient from the first part (6) and the constant term from the second part (20):\n\\[\n6 \\times 20 = 120\n\\]\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}."

    "text": " The problem is asking specifically for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which means I need to find the term where the powers of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2. \n\nLet me focus on the first part: \\((a + b)^4\\). Using the binomial theorem, the expansion of this will have terms from \\(a^4\\) down to \\(b^4\\), each multiplied by a binomial coefficient. So, the general term is \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\\) for \\(k = 0\\) to \\(4\\). I need the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2, which means \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). So, that term would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} a^{2}b^{2}\\). Let me compute \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). I remember that \\(\\dbinom{n}{k} = \\dfrac{n!}{k!(n - k)!}\\), so plugging in the numbers, that's \\(\\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient from the first part is 6.\n\nNow, the second part of the expression is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I need to figure out how this part affects the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, but \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) are separate variables from \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). So, does that mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just the product of the coefficients from each part? Because when you multiply two expressions, the coefficients multiply if the variables are the same. But here, the variables are different: one part has \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), the other has \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, when you multiply them, the terms will involve products like \\(a^2b^2 \\times c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2 \\times c^{-k}\\), but since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I think the other variables don't matter. That is, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression will just be the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part, but since the second part doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms, maybe it just adds a factor of 1? Wait, that doesn't make sense. Let me think again.\n\nWait, actually, when you multiply two expressions together, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by every term in the second part. But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\), that is, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) irrespective of what's happening with \\(c\\). So, in other words, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire second part. Because when you multiply, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will be present in all those products, each time with different powers of \\(c\\), but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\), it's just 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Wait, but that can't be right because the second part has variables, not just coefficients. Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), treating \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) as separate variables, so the coefficient might actually be 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. But that doesn't seem right because the coefficient is a number, not an expression. Maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem.\n\nWait, let me read the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, perhaps it's just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, that would mean that when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but since we're only considering the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\), then the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that doesn't seem correct because the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) would be when you set \\(c = 1\\), so \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). So, would the coefficient be 6 * 64 = 384? Hmm, that seems high. Let me check.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are in one part and \\(c\\) is in the other, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would just be the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. But that would mean the coefficient is 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is not a number but an expression. But the problem is asking for a coefficient, which should be a number. So, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating all variables as separate, so it's actually looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some \\(k\\), but the problem statement just says \\(a^2b^2\\), so maybe it's only considering the terms where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2, regardless of the exponents of \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), because each term in the first part's \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by every term in the second part, so the total coefficient would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients of the second part.\n\nBut wait, the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), so \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient would be 6 * 64 = 384. But I'm not sure if that's correct because the problem might be asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, so it's the sum of all coefficients of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for any \\(k\\), which would indeed be 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Alternatively, maybe the problem is only considering the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms, which would mean that \\(c\\) must be raised to the 0 power, i.e., the constant term. So, perhaps I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by the constant term of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). That would make sense too because then the coefficient would be a number, not an expression. So, let me explore that possibility.\n\nIn that case, the coefficient would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part, which is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). To find the constant term, I can use the binomial theorem again. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(1/c\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). The constant term occurs when the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\), which is 20.\n\nSo, if that's the case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 * 20 = 120. That seems more reasonable. Wait, but earlier I thought it might be 384, but that was under the assumption that I was summing all coefficients in the second part, which would give me 64, and then multiplying by 6 to get 384. But now, considering that the problem might be asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times the constant term in the second part, I get 120.\n\nI think I need to clarify what exactly is being asked. The problem says: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\).\" So, it's possible that the question is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the powers of \\(c\\), which would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which is 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, it might be asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times the constant term in the second part, which would be 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, perhaps I should look at the problem again. The problem is written as: \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, when you multiply these two expressions, each term in the first will be multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by every term in the second part, which includes terms with different powers of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would actually be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire second part. But that would mean the coefficient is 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is an expression, not a number. But the problem is asking for a coefficient, which should be a number, so perhaps that's not the case.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is only interested in the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\), i.e., the constant term. That would make sense because then the coefficient would be a number. So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 (from the first part) multiplied by the constant term from the second part, which is 20, giving 120. That seems more plausible.\n\nWait, but let me check with an example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^2 (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, expanding, the first part is \\(a^2 + 2ab + b^2\\), and the second part is \\(c + 1/c\\). So, the product would be \\(a^2c + a^2/c + 2abc + 2ab/c + b^2c + b^2/c\\). Now, if I look for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but in this case, there's no \\(a^2b^2\\) term because the first part only goes up to \\(b^2\\), but in the product, the highest power is \\(a^2b^2c\\) etc. Wait, no, in this example, the first part is \\((a + b)^2\\), so \\(a^2 + 2ab + b^2\\), and the second part is \\(c + 1/c\\). So, when you multiply, the term \\(a^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), giving \\(a^2c\\) and \\(a^2/c\\). Similarly, \\(2ab\\) is multiplied by \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), giving \\(2abc\\) and \\(2ab/c\\). And \\(b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), giving \\(b^2c\\) and \\(b^2/c\\). So, there's no \\(a^2b^2\\) term in this product because the first part only has up to \\(b^2\\), and the second part doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\). So, in this example, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be zero because there's no such term.\n\nBut in our original problem, the first part is \\((a + b)^4\\), which does have an \\(a^2b^2\\) term. So, when multiplied by the second part, which is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second part, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for various \\(k\\). So, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second part. But if it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the constant term, then it's 6 times the constant term in the second part, which is 20, giving 120.\n\nWait, but in the example I just did, if I were to ask for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^2 (c + 1/c)^1\\), the answer would be zero because there's no \\(a^2b^2\\) term. So, in our problem, since \\((a + b)^4\\) does have an \\(a^2b^2\\) term, when multiplied by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually be 6 times the entire expansion of the second part, but that's not a number. So, perhaps the problem is miswritten, or I'm misinterpreting it. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be 120.\n\nWait, let me check the problem again: it says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\". It doesn't mention \\(c\\), so perhaps it's considering all possible powers of \\(c\\), meaning that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which is 6 * 64 = 384. But that seems high, and in the example, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be zero because there's no such term, which aligns with that approach. So, in our problem, since the first part has \\(a^2b^2\\), the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of coefficients in the second part, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nBut wait, in the example, the first part was \\((a + b)^2\\), which has \\(a^2 + 2ab + b^2\\), so when multiplied by the second part, which has \\(c + 1/c\\), the product has terms like \\(a^2c\\), \\(a^2/c\\), \\(2abc\\), \\(2ab/c\\), \\(b^2c\\), \\(b^2/c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in this product is zero because there's no \\(a^2b^2\\) term. So, if I were to compute the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^2 (c + 1/c)^1\\), it's zero. Therefore, in our problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second part, which is 6 * 64 = 384, because the second part's sum of coefficients is \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\).\n\nWait, but that seems counterintuitive because the second part doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), so how does it affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)? Actually, when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would indeed be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Because each term in the first part's \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by every term in the second part, which has coefficients that add up to 64. So, the total coefficient would be 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nBut I'm a bit confused because in the example, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) was zero because the first part didn't have that term. So, in our problem, since the first part does have the \\(a^2b^2\\) term, the coefficient would be 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is only interested in the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\), which would be the constant term. In that case, the coefficient would be 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, I think I need to resolve this confusion. Let me try to think of it differently. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. So, in the product, each term will be of the form \\(a^kb^{4 - k} \\times c^m c^{-n}\\), but the variables are separate. So, when looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\), we can treat the second part as a polynomial in \\(c\\), and when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), it will contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. So, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nBut wait, that doesn't seem right because the second part is a polynomial in \\(c\\), and when you multiply it by \\(a^2b^2\\), you're just scaling \\(a^2b^2\\) by the entire second polynomial. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would indeed be 6 times the entire second polynomial, which is 6 * \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that's not a number, it's an expression. Therefore, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the constant term in \\(c\\), which would be 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nI think that's the correct approach. So, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, but since the product includes terms with \\(c\\), and \\(c\\) is another variable, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), because otherwise, the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense for a coefficient. Therefore, I think the intended answer is 120.\n\nSo, to recap:\n\n1. Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is 6.\n\n2. Find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n\n3. Multiply the two coefficients: 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then finding the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20. Multiplying these gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

If I have two expressions multiplied together, say \\(E = E_1 \\times E_2\\), where \\(E_1\\) has variables \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and \\(E_2\\) has variables \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), then when I expand \\(E\\), each term in \\(E_1\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(E_2\\). So, for example, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(E_1\\) would be multiplied by each term in \\(E_2\\), resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2c^{-k}\\), where \\(k\\) is some exponent from \\(E_2\\). \n\nBut the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, but in the entire expression, \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by various powers of \\(c\\). So, does the problem mean the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, or just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\)? Hmm, the problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", so I think it's referring to the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2, and the exponents of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) are zero, meaning \\(c^0\\). \n\nSo, in that case, I need to find the term in the expansion where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\). So, that would be the coefficient in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nOkay, so first, I found that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. Now, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nLet me work on that. Using the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). \n\nSo, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). I want the exponent of \\(c\\) to be 0, so I set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), I get \\(6 = 2k\\), so \\(k = 3\\). \n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Let me compute that. \n\n\\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). \n\nWait, that can't be right. Wait, 6! is 720, but 3! is 6, so 6!/(3!3!) is 720/(6*6) = 720/36 = 20. Yeah, that's correct. So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. \n\nSo, now, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficients from each part, right? So, that would be 6 (from \\(a^2b^2\\)) multiplied by 20 (from \\(c^0\\)), which is 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but in the entire expression, which includes terms with \\(c\\) as well. So, does the term \\(a^2b^2\\) exist without any \\(c\\) terms? Or does it get multiplied by some \\(c\\) terms? \n\nWait, no, because in the expansion, each term is a product of a term from \\((a + b)^4\\) and a term from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, so \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for various \\(k\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would include all the terms where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2, regardless of the exponents of \\(c\\). \n\nWait, that's a different interpretation. So, maybe I was wrong before. Let me clarify: if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\), then it's the sum of all coefficients where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any power of \\(c\\). \n\nBut that doesn't make much sense because \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by different powers of \\(c\\), each with their own coefficients. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would have a coefficient that's the sum of all the coefficients from the second expansion, because each term in the second expansion is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). \n\nWait, but that can't be right either because the second expansion is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which when expanded, has terms like \\(c^6\\), \\(6c^4\\), \\(15c^2\\), \\(20\\), \\(15c^{-2}\\), \\(6c^{-4}\\), \\(c^{-6}\\). So, if I multiply each of these by \\(a^2b^2\\), then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be \\(a^2b^2\\) times the sum of all the coefficients in the second expansion. \n\nWait, but that would mean the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, then the coefficient would be 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nBut wait, that seems too high. Let me think again. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, in that case, every term in the expansion that has \\(a^2b^2\\) times any power of \\(c\\) would contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). \n\nBut actually, when you have a term like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), the coefficient is the product of the coefficients from each part. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) is 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^k\\) in the second expansion. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which, if interpreted as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), would be 6 * 20 = 120, as I found earlier. \n\nAlternatively, if it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), then it's 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nWait, but I think the problem is more likely asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), because otherwise, it would be a very large coefficient. Let me check the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" \n\nSo, it's just asking for \\(a^2b^2\\), without any mention of \\(c\\). So, in the entire expression, which includes \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by all the terms from the second expansion. So, the coefficient would be the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all coefficients from the second part. \n\nWait, but that would be 6 times 64, which is 384, as I thought earlier. But let me make sure. Alternatively, maybe the problem wants the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which would mean that we're treating \\(c\\) as another variable, but the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be the same as in the first part, since the second part doesn't affect \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). But that doesn't seem right because when you multiply, each term from the first part is multiplied by each term from the second part, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually be 6 times the entire second expansion, but that's not possible because the second expansion has terms with \\(c\\). \n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me approach this differently. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). When you expand this, each term will be of the form \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}a^{4 - k}b^k \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - m}(1/c)^m = \\dbinom{4}{k}\\dbinom{6}{m} a^{4 - k}b^k c^{6 - 2m}\\). \n\nSo, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would occur when \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\), as before. So, the coefficient from the first part is 6. Then, for each \\(m\\), we have a coefficient from the second part, which is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\), and each of these is multiplied by 6. So, the total coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 times the sum over all \\(m\\) of \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\), because each term in the second expansion is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). \n\nWait, but the sum over all \\(m\\) of \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\) is \\(2^6 = 64\\), as I thought earlier. So, the coefficient would be 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nBut that seems high, and I'm not sure if that's the correct interpretation. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the powers of \\(c\\), which would mean that we're considering \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by any power of \\(c\\), so the coefficient would indeed be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nWait, but I'm now confused because I thought earlier that the problem might be asking for \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be 6 * 20 = 120. So, which is it? Let me try to see if I can find any examples or similar problems. \n\nIn typical problems like this, when they ask for the coefficient of a term that doesn't involve another variable, they usually mean the term where the other variables are raised to the zero power. So, in this case, \\(a^2b^2\\) with \\(c^0\\). Therefore, the coefficient would be 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nAlternatively, if they had asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some \\(k\\), then it would be different, but since they just asked for \\(a^2b^2\\), I think they mean \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). \n\nWait, let me check by expanding the expression. Let's take a simpler case. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^1 \\times (c + 1/c)^1 = (a + b)(c + 1/c)\\). The expansion would be \\(ac + a/c + bc + b/c\\). Now, if I look for the coefficient of \\(a^1b^0c^0\\), that would be zero because there's no such term. But if I look for the coefficient of \\(a^1b^0\\), regardless of \\(c\\), that would be the sum of coefficients of \\(a^1b^0c^k\\), which would be \\(1 \\times (1 + 1) = 2\\). Wait, but in this case, the coefficient of \\(a^1b^0c^1\\) is 1, and the coefficient of \\(a^1b^0c^{-1}\\) is 1, so the sum would be 2. \n\nBut in the original problem, the user is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so if we follow the same logic, it would be the sum of coefficients of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for all \\(k\\), which would be 6 times the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nBut in my earlier thought, I thought the problem meant \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. So, I'm now confused about which interpretation is correct. Let me see if I can find a definitive answer. \n\nWait, perhaps the problem is intended to ask for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would make the answer 120. Alternatively, if it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), then it's 384. \n\nLet me try to see which makes more sense. If I think about the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) can be multiplied by any power of \\(c\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the same as the coefficient in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion. \n\nWait, but in reality, when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in one polynomial is multiplied by each term in the other polynomial. So, for example, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). \n\nBut that's only if you're treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable. So, in that case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would indeed be 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nWait, but I'm not sure. Let me think about it differently. Suppose I set \\(c = 1\\). Then the expression becomes \\((a + b)^4 \\times (1 + 1)^6 = (a + b)^4 \\times 64\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in this case would be 6 * 64 = 384, which aligns with the earlier calculation. \n\nAlternatively, if I set \\(c = 1\\) and look for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), that would give me 384. So, perhaps that's the correct answer. \n\nBut I'm still confused because I initially thought the problem was asking for \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be 120. So, maybe I should clarify that. \n\nWait, let me check the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), without any mention of \\(c\\). So, in the product, each term is a product of a term from \\((a + b)^4\\) and a term from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\). \n\nBut the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would be the sum of all coefficients of terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present, regardless of the power of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nWait, but that seems counterintuitive because when you multiply by the second expansion, you're adding more terms, but the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and the second part doesn't affect it because \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\). But that doesn't make sense because when you multiply, each term is multiplied by each term from the other expansion. \n\nWait, perhaps I should think of it as two separate variables. So, in the product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is only affected by the first expansion, and the second expansion only affects the powers of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be 6, and the powers of \\(c\\) are separate. But that can't be right because when you multiply, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, so \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, resulting in \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) terms. \n\nWait, but the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not \\(a^2b^2c^k\\). So, perhaps the answer is 6, because the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6, and the second part doesn't affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) because \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\). \n\nBut that seems incorrect because when you multiply two expressions, each term in one is multiplied by each term in the other. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would actually be the coefficient in the first part times the sum of all coefficients in the second part. \n\nWait, no, that's not right. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient from the first part times the sum of the coefficients from the second part, because each term in the second part is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). \n\nWait, let me take a simpler example to test this. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^1 \\times (c + 1/c)^1 = (a + b)(c + 1/c)\\). The expansion is \\(ac + a/c + bc + b/c\\). Now, the coefficient of \\(a^1b^0\\) in this product would be the sum of the coefficients of \\(a^1b^0c^k\\), which are \\(1 \\times 1\\) (for \\(ac\\)) and \\(1 \\times 1\\) (for \\(a/c\\)), so the total coefficient is 2. Similarly, the coefficient of \\(a^0b^1\\) would also be 2. \n\nSo, in this case, the coefficient of \\(a^1b^0\\) is 2, which is the coefficient from the first part (which is 1 for \\(a^1b^0\\)) times the sum of coefficients from the second part (which is 2, since \\((c + 1/c)^1\\) has coefficients 1 and 1). \n\nSo, applying this logic to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient from the first part (which is 6) times the sum of coefficients from the second part (which is 64). So, 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 384. \n\nBut wait, earlier I thought it was 120, so I'm confused. Let me try to see where I went wrong. \n\nIn the simpler example, the coefficient of \\(a^1b^0\\) is 2, which is 1 * 2. Similarly, in the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nAlternatively, if the problem had asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), that would be 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nSo, perhaps the problem is ambiguous, but given that it just asks for \\(a^2b^2\\), I think it's more likely that it's asking for the coefficient regardless of the powers of \\(c\\), which would be 384. \n\nWait, but I'm not entirely sure. Let me check another example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^2\\). Expanding this, I get:\n\n\\((a^2 + 2ab + b^2)(c^2 + 2 + c^{-2})\\).\n\nNow, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in this product would be the sum of the coefficients of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for all \\(k\\). But looking at the expansion, the terms involving \\(a^2b^2\\) would be \\(a^2b^2c^2\\), \\(a^2b^2 \\times 2\\), and \\(a^2b^2c^{-2}\\). So, the coefficients are \\(1 \\times 1 = 1\\), \\(2 \\times 2 = 4\\), and \\(1 \\times 1 = 1\\), so the total coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 1 + 4 + 1 = 6, which is the same as the coefficient in \\((a + b)^2\\) times the sum of coefficients in \\((c + 1/c)^2\\), which is 1 + 2 + 1 = 4. Wait, no, that doesn't add up because 2 * 4 = 8, but the actual coefficient is 6. Hmm, so maybe my earlier logic is flawed. \n\nWait, in this example, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, which is the same as the coefficient in \\((a + b)^2\\) times the sum of coefficients in \\((c + 1/c)^2\\), which is 4. But 2 * 4 = 8, which doesn't match 6. So, that suggests that my earlier logic is incorrect. \n\nWait, perhaps the correct approach is that when you have two separate variables, the coefficient of a term involving only those variables is just the coefficient from the first expansion. Because when you multiply, the variables don't interfere. So, in the example, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^2\\), which is 1, multiplied by the entire second expansion, but that doesn't make sense because the variables are separate. \n\nWait, no, in the example, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6, but the coefficient in \\((a + b)^2\\) is 1, and the sum of coefficients in \\((c + 1/c)^2\\) is 4. So, 1 * 4 = 4, which doesn't match 6. So, perhaps my initial approach is wrong. \n\nWait, maybe I should consider that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the same as in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and the second expansion doesn't affect it because \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\). But in the example, that would mean the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 1, but in reality, it's 6. So, that can't be right. \n\nWait, perhaps the confusion arises because in the example, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is actually 6, which comes from the product of the coefficients from each part. Wait, no, in the example, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, which is the same as the sum of the products of coefficients from each part where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2. \n\nWait, in the example, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, which comes from 2ab from the first expansion multiplied by 2 from the second expansion, plus a^2 times 1, and b^2 times 1. Wait, no, that doesn't make sense. \n\nWait, perhaps I'm making this too complicated. Let me think again. \n\nIn the original problem, we have two separate parts: \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). When we multiply these together, each term in the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), etc. \n\nBut the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would be the sum of all coefficients of terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present, regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, that would be the coefficient from the first part (6) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients from the second part (64), giving 384. \n\nBut in the example I did earlier, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) was 6, which is the same as the coefficient in the first part times the sum of coefficients in the second part (1 * 4 = 4), but that doesn't match. So, perhaps my approach is incorrect. \n\nWait, in the example, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, but the coefficient in the first part is 1, and the sum of coefficients in the second part is 4, so 1 * 4 = 4, which doesn't match 6. So, that suggests that my approach is wrong. \n\nWait, maybe the correct way is to realize that the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product comes from multiplying \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part by each term in the second part. So, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which is 64, giving 384. \n\nBut in the example, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) was 6, which is 1 (from the first part) times 6 (sum of coefficients in the second part). Wait, but in the example, the second part was \\((c + 1/c)^2\\), which has a sum of coefficients equal to 4, but the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) was 6. So, that doesn't align. \n\nWait, perhaps the correct approach is that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just the coefficient from the first part, because the second part only affects the powers of \\(c\\), not the coefficients of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). So, in the example, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 1, but in reality, it's 6, so that can't be right either. \n\nI'm getting more confused. Maybe I should approach this differently. Let me consider the problem as two separate parts: the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) part, and the \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) part. \n\nThe term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), and its coefficient is 6. The second part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), when expanded, has terms with various powers of \\(c\\). \n\nWhen you multiply the two expansions together, each term from the first part is multiplied by each term from the second part. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), etc. \n\nBut the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would be the sum of all coefficients of terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present, regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, that would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, giving 384. \n\nWait, but in the example I did earlier, where \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^2\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) was 6, which is 1 (from the first part) times 6 (sum of coefficients in the second part). Wait, but in that case, the sum of coefficients in the second part was 4, so 1 * 4 = 4, but the actual coefficient was 6. So, that suggests that my approach is wrong. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just the coefficient from the first part, because the second part only affects the \\(c\\) terms. But in the example, that would mean the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 1, but it's actually 6, so that can't be right. \n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think of the problem as follows: the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, that would be 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nBut in the example, that would mean the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 1 * 4 = 4, but in reality, it's 6, so that approach is incorrect. \n\nWait, perhaps the correct approach is that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just the coefficient from the first part, 6, because the second part only affects the \\(c\\) terms, and the variables are separate. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the same as in the first part. \n\nBut in the example, that would mean the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 1, but in reality, it's 6, so that can't be right either. \n\nI'm really stuck here. Maybe I should try to compute the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product by considering that each term in the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the sum over all terms in the second expansion multiplied by the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part. \n\nWait, but that would mean the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which is 64, giving 384. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to ask for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nWait, maybe I should check both interpretations and see which one makes sense. \n\nIf I consider that the problem is asking for \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then the coefficient is 120. If it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), then it's 384. \n\nGiven that the problem didn't specify anything about \\(c\\), I think it's more likely that they're asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. \n\nWait, but I'm not entirely sure. Let me try to see if I can find a definitive"

    "text": " \n\nThe problem is asking specifically about the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). That means I need to find the term where the power of \\(a\\) is 2 and the power of \\(b\\) is 2 in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\). Let me write that out. \n\nIn the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\), each term is \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\\). I need the term where \\(4 - k = 2\\) for \\(a\\), which means \\(k = 2\\) for \\(b\\). So, substituting \\(k = 2\\), the term is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} a^{2}b^{2}\\). \n\nCalculating the binomial coefficient \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\), I remember that \\(\\dbinom{n}{k} = \\dfrac{n!}{k!(n - k)!}\\). So, plugging in the numbers, \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6. \n\nWait, but the original expression isn't just \\((a + b)^4\\); it's multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I need to consider that as well. Hmm, how does that affect the coefficient? \n\nI think I need to multiply the entire expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) by the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I don't need to worry about the terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), right? Because \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), so maybe the coefficient is just the product of the coefficients from each part? \n\nWait, no, that doesn't seem quite right. Let me think again. The expression is a product of two separate expansions: one in terms of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and another in terms of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). When you multiply them together, each term from the first expansion gets multiplied by each term from the second expansion. \n\nBut since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), that means we're looking for the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, because only then will the term not involve \\(c\\) and remain as a constant (with respect to \\(c\\)) multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). \n\nSo, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by \\(c^0\\), you just get \\(a^2b^2\\), and that's the term we're interested in. \n\nOkay, so I already found that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. Now, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\), I can again use the binomial theorem. Let me write that out. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying each term, that becomes \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m} = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). \n\nSo, each term has an exponent of \\(6 - 2m\\). We want the term where the exponent is 0, so we set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). \n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). Wait, is that right? Let me check: \\(6! = 720\\), \\(3! = 6\\), so \\(720 / (6 \\times 6) = 720 / 36 = 20\\). Yes, that's correct. \n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Now, going back to the original expression, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the product of the coefficients from each part. That is, 6 (from \\(a^2b^2\\)) multiplied by 20 (from \\(c^0\\)). So, 6 times 20 is 120. \n\nWait a second, let me make sure I'm not missing anything here. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product. Since the two parts are multiplied together, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) is to multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by the term in the second expansion that doesn't involve \\(c\\), which is \\(c^0\\). \n\nTherefore, the coefficient is indeed the product of the two coefficients: 6 and 20, giving 120. \n\nWait, but just to double-check, maybe I should consider if there are any other terms that could contribute to \\(a^2b^2\\). For example, if there were terms with negative exponents in \\(c\\) that could somehow combine to give a positive exponent, but no, because \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), so any term involving \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\) would have to multiply with a term that cancels out the \\(c\\) part. But since \\(a^2b^2\\) is independent of \\(c\\), the only way is to multiply by \\(c^0\\). \n\nSo, I think my reasoning is correct. The coefficient is 120. \n\nLet me recap:\n\n1. Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is 6.\n2. Expand \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\), which is 20.\n3. Multiply these two coefficients together because the terms are multiplied in the original expression: 6 * 20 = 120.\n4. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120.\n\nI think that makes sense. I don't see any mistakes in the steps I took. So, I'm confident that the answer is 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem.\n\nFirst, consider the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\). Using the binomial theorem, we have:\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n\\]\nWe need the term where the powers of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2. This occurs when \\(k = 2\\):\n\\[\n\\dbinom{4}{2} a^2 b^2 = 6 a^2 b^2\n\\]\nSo, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\nNext, consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem, we have:\n\\[\n\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n\\]\nWe need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0. Setting \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), we find \\(m = 3\\):\n\\[\n\\dbinom{6}{3} c^0 = 20\n\\]\nSo, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20.\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficients from each part:\n\\[\n6 \\times 20 = 120\n\\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

    "text": " \n\nAlright, so the first part is \\((a + b)^4\\). Let me expand that using the binomial theorem. The expansion would be \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\\). I'm looking for the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2, right? Because I need the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, in the expansion, when does \\(a^{4 - k}b^k\\) become \\(a^2b^2\\)? Let me set up the equation: \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). Solving that, yes, \\(k = 2\\) gives me \\(a^{2}b^{2}\\). So, the coefficient here would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). \n\nCalculating \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\), which is \\(\\dfrac{4!}{2!2!}\\). That equals \\(\\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient from the first part is 6. \n\nNow, the second part of the expression is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Hmm, I'm not sure if I need to expand this part as well, but wait, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\). So, maybe the second part just contributes a constant factor, and I can compute it separately? Let me think.\n\nWait, no, actually, the entire expression is the product of \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when we multiply these two expansions together, each term from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term from the second expansion. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), that means we need to find the term in the second expansion that is a constant (i.e., \\(c^0\\)), because when we multiply it by \\(a^2b^2\\), it won't affect the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). \n\nSo, I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). How do I do that? Again, using the binomial theorem: \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying each term, that becomes \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). \n\nWe want the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, because that's the constant term. So, set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). \n\nCalculating \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\), which is \\(\\dfrac{6!}{3!3!}\\). That's \\(\\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20. \n\nNow, putting it all together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficient from the first part and the constant term from the second part. So, that's \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). \n\nWait, let me double-check that. So, from \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, and from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the constant term is 20. Multiplying them together gives 120. That seems right. \n\nI don't think I missed anything here. The key was realizing that to get the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), the other part of the product must contribute a constant term so that the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) remain 2 each. If I had included a term with \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), that would change the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), which we don't want.

Wait, no, that doesn't make sense because when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first polynomial gets multiplied by each term in the second. But since we're only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), perhaps the other terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) don't contribute to \\(a^2b^2\\). \n\nWait, that might not be right. Let me think again. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\), and when we multiply it by any term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), it will still be \\(a^2b^2\\) times some power of \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product. So, does that mean we're considering the entire expression, including all the terms from both expansions? \n\nWait, but the problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", so maybe it's considering the entire product, but \\(a^2b^2\\) is only present in the first part, and when multiplied by terms from the second part, each term will have \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^k\\) or \\(c^{-k}\\). But if the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, then maybe we can treat the two parts separately. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) because if we multiply by the second part, which has terms with \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), the only way to have \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms is if we multiply by the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But I'm not sure. Let me read the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\)\". It doesn't specify anything about \\(c\\), so maybe it's just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). \n\nWait, but that can't be because when you multiply two polynomials, each term from the first is multiplied by each term from the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part would be multiplied by each term from the second part, each of which has a different power of \\(c\\). Therefore, in the product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will actually be multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), meaning that \\(a^2b^2\\) will have multiple coefficients depending on the power of \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so perhaps it's considering all the terms where the \\(a^2b^2\\) term is present, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. \n\nWait, that doesn't make sense because in the product, each term is a combination of \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\), and \\(1/c\\). So, if we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then it's simply the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that seems too broad. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by \\(c^0\\), i.e., the constant term. \n\nWait, let me check the problem again: It says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\". So, perhaps it's considering the entire expression and looking for all terms where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2 each, regardless of the exponents of \\(c\\). But that seems unlikely because in the product, each term would have both \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) exponents and \\(c\\) exponents. So, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where \\(a\\) is squared, \\(b\\) is squared, and \\(c\\) is to the zero power. That would make sense because otherwise, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the sum of all coefficients from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) multiplied by 6, which is 6 times the sum of the coefficients of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). \n\nWait, but the sum of the coefficients of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is obtained by setting \\(c = 1\\), which would give \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, if that's the case, then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\) would be 6 * 64 = 384. But I'm not sure if that's what the problem is asking. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), i.e., the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by the constant term from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). \n\nLet me think again. When you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, in this case, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6a^2b^2. Then, when you multiply it by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), you get 6a^2b^2 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Therefore, in the product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will have a coefficient that is 6 times each coefficient from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). \n\nBut wait, the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is obtained by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\) would be 6 * 64 = 384. However, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then we need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) and then multiply it by 6. \n\nSo, let's clarify: The problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\". It doesn't specify anything about \\(c\\), so I think it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nWait, but that seems a bit off because when you multiply, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, each of which has a different power of \\(c\\). So, in the product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually be accompanied by all possible powers of \\(c\\), and each of those would have a different coefficient. So, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without any restriction on \\(c\\), then it's just 6 times the sum of the coefficients of the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nBut let me check if that's correct. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\). In that case, we need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) and then multiply it by 6. \n\nSo, let's find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(1/c\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so 6 - 2k = 0. Solving for k: 6 = 2k => k = 3. So, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). \n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 20. So, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it's 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nWait, but the problem just says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\". So, I'm a bit confused. If it's just \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\), then it's 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. But if it's \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it's 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nLet me see if I can find any clues in the problem statement. It says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\)\". So, it's just \\(a^2b^2\\), without specifying \\(c\\). Therefore, perhaps the answer is 384. But I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, maybe the problem is considering the entire expression and only looking for the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, so the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nWait, but that seems a bit too straightforward. Alternatively, maybe the problem is expecting me to consider that the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, so the coefficient would be 6 times each coefficient in the second expansion, but that's not possible because each term in the product would have both \\(a^2b^2\\) and some power of \\(c\\). So, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), then it's 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, considering all possible powers of \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 384. \n\nWait, but let me think again. If I have \\((a + b)^4 = A\\), and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = B\\), then the product is A * B. So, when I multiply A by B, each term in A is multiplied by each term in B. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in A is multiplied by each term in B, so in the product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will have a coefficient that is 6 times each coefficient in B. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in B, which is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nBut wait, that would mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 384, regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, for example, \\(a^2b^2c^6\\) would have a coefficient of 6 * 1 = 6, \\(a^2b^2c^4\\) would have a coefficient of 6 * 6 = 36, and so on, up to \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) which would have a coefficient of 6 * 20 = 120. So, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), then it's 384. But if it's asking for \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it's 120. \n\nWait, but the problem didn't specify anything about \\(c\\), so maybe it's just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), which would be 384. But I'm not entirely sure. Let me check the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\)\". It doesn't specify \\(c\\), so perhaps it's considering all terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) appears, regardless of the power of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient would be the sum of all coefficients of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for any integer \\(k\\), which would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nBut wait, that seems a bit odd because usually, when you're asked for the coefficient of a specific term in a product, you're considering the term with all variables. So, maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\). That would make more sense because otherwise, the coefficient would be a sum over multiple terms. \n\nLet me try to think of it another way. If I have two polynomials, P(a,b) and Q(c), then the product P(a,b) * Q(c) would have terms where each term in P is multiplied by each term in Q. So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\), then it's the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in P(a,b) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in Q(c). Because each term in P(a,b) is multiplied by each term in Q(c), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in P(a,b) times the sum of coefficients in Q(c). \n\nSo, in this case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in P(a,b) is 6, and the sum of coefficients in Q(c) is obtained by setting c = 1, which gives (1 + 1)^6 = 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nBut I'm still a bit uncertain because sometimes problems specify the term they want in the entire product, considering all variables. So, if they had asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), it would be different. But since they didn't specify \\(c\\), maybe it's 384. \n\nWait, let me think about it differently. If I consider the entire product, each term is of the form \\(a^kb^{4 - k}c^m\\), where \\(k\\) ranges from 0 to 4, and \\(m\\) ranges based on the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be present in the product for all possible \\(m\\), each multiplied by the corresponding coefficient from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the sum over all \\(m\\) of (coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the coefficient of \\(c^m\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\)). \n\nBut since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of \\(m\\), that would be the sum over all \\(m\\) of (6 * coefficient of \\(c^m\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\)), which is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). And since the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is obtained by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives 64, the total coefficient would be 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nAlternatively, if the problem had asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), it would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nWait, but let me confirm this by considering a simpler case. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Let's compute this manually. \n\nFirst, \\((a + b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2\\). \n\nSecond, \\((c + 1/c)^1 = c + 1/c\\). \n\nMultiplying them together: (a^2 + 2ab + b^2)(c + 1/c) = a^2c + a^2/c + 2abc + 2ab/c + b^2c + b^2/c. \n\nNow, if I look for the coefficient of \\(a^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\), it would be the sum of the coefficients of \\(a^2c\\) and \\(a^2/c\\), which are 1 and 1, so the total coefficient is 2. Alternatively, if I look for the coefficient of \\(a^2c^0\\), it would be 0 because there's no \\(a^2\\) term without \\(c\\). \n\nWait, but in this case, the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\) is 2, which is the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) in \\((a + b)^2\\) times the sum of coefficients in \\((c + 1/c)^1\\). The sum of coefficients in \\((c + 1/c)^1\\) is (1 + 1) = 2. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) in the product is 1 (from \\((a + b)^2\\)) times 2, which is 2. \n\nSo, applying the same logic to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). \n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is obtained by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nWait, but in my simple example, the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) in the product was 2, which is 1 * 2, so that seems to confirm the logic. Therefore, in the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nBut let me double-check this because sometimes people interpret the problem differently. If the problem had asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), it would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nAlternatively, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), then it's 384. \n\nWait, but the problem didn't specify \\(c\\), so maybe it's 384. However, I'm a bit unsure because in the product, each term has both \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) and \\(c\\). So, maybe the problem is expecting me to consider that the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is only present in the first part, and when multiplied by the second part, it's spread out over different \\(c\\) terms. Therefore, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms, it would be zero because there's no such term in the product. But that doesn't make sense because when you multiply, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by all the terms in the second expansion, so each term would have \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by some power of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms is zero, but that's not what the problem is asking. \n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try to think differently. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). In the product \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) can only come from the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), and when you multiply it by the second part, each term in the second part will add a power of \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\). Therefore, in the product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), etc., each with their own coefficients. \n\nSo, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then it's the sum of all coefficients of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for all \\(k\\). But in reality, each of these terms has a different power of \\(c\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the coefficient from the first part, 6, multiplied by each coefficient from the second part, summed over all possible \\(k\\). Therefore, it's 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nAlternatively, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it's 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part, which is 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nBut since the problem didn't specify anything about \\(c\\), I think it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), which would be 384. \n\nWait, but let me make sure. Let me think about the expansion. When I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, which includes \\(c^6\\), \\(6c^4\\), \\(15c^2\\), \\(20c^0\\), \\(15c^{-2}\\), \\(6c^{-4}\\), and \\(c^{-6}\\). Therefore, the product will include terms like \\(6a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(36a^2b^2c^4\\), \\(90a^2b^2c^2\\), \\(120a^2b^2c^0\\), \\(90a^2b^2c^{-2}\\), \\(36a^2b^2c^{-4}\\), and \\(6a^2b^2c^{-6}\\). \n\nSo, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\), then it's the sum of all these coefficients: 6 + 36 + 90 + 120 + 90 + 36 + 6. Let me compute that: 6 + 36 = 42; 42 + 90 = 132; 132 + 120 = 252; 252 + 90 = 342; 342 + 36 = 378; 378 + 6 = 384. So, the total coefficient is 384. \n\nBut if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it's just 120. \n\nTherefore, based on the problem statement, which just asks for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I think the answer is 384. \n\nWait, but let me check if this makes sense. The sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is indeed 64, as we saw earlier, so 6 * 64 = 384. So, yes, that seems correct. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is expecting me to consider that the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is only present in the first part, and since the second part is multiplied by it, the coefficient would just be 6 times the entire second expansion, but that's not how coefficients work. The coefficient of a term in a product is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each factor. So, in this case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nTherefore, I think the answer is 384. \n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes in my reasoning. Let me go through it again. \n\n1. Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem: \\(a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. \n\n2. The problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). \n\n3. When you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). \n\n4. Therefore, in the product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be present in multiple terms, each multiplied by a different power of \\(c\\). \n\n5. If the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then it's the sum of all coefficients of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for all \\(k\\). \n\n6. The sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is obtained by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). \n\n7. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nYes, that seems correct. \n\nAlternatively, if the problem had asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then we would find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 20, and then multiply by 6 to get 120. \n\nBut since the problem didn't specify anything about \\(c\\), I think the answer is 384. \n\nWait, but let me check one more time. If I have two polynomials, P and Q, then the coefficient of a term \\(x^k\\) in P * Q is the sum over all \\(i + j = k\\) of (coefficient of \\(x^i\\) in P) * (coefficient of \\(x^j\\) in Q). But in this case, \\(x\\) is a combination of \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\). So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), but not in \\(c\\), then perhaps it's better to think of it as a term in the polynomial ring where \\(c\\) is a separate variable. \n\nWait, but in reality, \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are different variables, so the term \\(a^2b^2\\) can't exist without some power of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is actually zero because there's no term in the product that has only \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms. \n\nWait, that makes sense because when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in the product has both \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) exponents and some power of \\(c\\). Therefore, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) alone doesn't exist; it's always accompanied by some power of \\(c\\). So, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\), then it's actually considering all the terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present, each multiplied by a different power of \\(c\\). \n\nBut in that case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the sum of all the coefficients of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for any \\(k\\), which is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nWait, but that's a bit of a stretch because in reality, each term in the product has both \\(a^2b^2\\) and some power of \\(c\\). So, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\), then it's considering all such terms, and their coefficients add up to 384. \n\nAlternatively, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it's 120. \n\nGiven that the problem didn't specify anything about \\(c\\), I think the answer is 384. \n\nBut to be absolutely sure, let me consider another approach. Let's compute the product \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) and look for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). \n\nFrom \\((a + b)^4\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) has a coefficient of 6. \n\nFrom \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the expansion is \\(c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15c^{-2} + 6c^{-4} + c^{-6}\\). \n\nSo, when we multiply 6a^2b^2 by each term in the second expansion, we get:\n\n- 6a^2b^2c^6\n- 36a^2b^2c^4\n- 90a^2b^2c^2\n- 120a^2b^2\n- 90a^2b^2c^{-2}\n- 36a^2b^2c^{-4}\n- 6a^2b^2c^{-6}\n\nSo, in the product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) appears with a coefficient of 120, and it's multiplied by \\(c^0\\). The other terms have \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by different powers of \\(c\\). \n\nTherefore, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\), then it's the sum of all coefficients of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for all \\(k\\), which is 6 + 36 + 90 + 120 + 90 + 36 + 6 = 384. \n\nBut if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it's 120. \n\nSince the problem didn't specify anything about \\(c\\), I think the answer is 384. \n\nWait, but in the product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is only present in the middle term, \\(120a^2b^2\\). All other terms have \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by some power of \\(c\\). So, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), without any \\(c\\) terms, then it's 120. \n\nWait, but in the product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is only present in the term \\(120a^2b^2c^0\\). So, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\), then it's 120 because that's the"

    "text": " \n\nThe first part of the expression is \\((a + b)^4\\). Let me write out its expansion. Using the binomial theorem, this would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{0}a^4 + \\dbinom{4}{1}a^3b + \\dbinom{4}{2}a^2b^2 + \\dbinom{4}{3}ab^3 + \\dbinom{4}{4}b^4\\). Calculating the coefficients, that's \\(1a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + 1b^4\\). So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in this part is 6. \n\nBut wait, the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I think I need to consider how this multiplication affects the terms. However, since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), maybe I don't need to expand the entire second part. Instead, perhaps I can just find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and then multiply it by the entire second part, assuming that the second part doesn't affect the powers of a and b. Hmm, but that doesn't seem right because when you multiply two expressions, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. \n\nWait, but the second part is in terms of c and 1/c, so when we multiply, the terms involving a and b won't interact with the terms involving c. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a coefficient, which is a numerical value, not an expression in terms of c. \n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so perhaps I don't need to worry about the c terms because they are separate variables. So, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But since the problem is only interested in the term \\(a^2b^2\\), the coefficient of this term in the product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all terms in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nWait, no, that doesn't sound right either. Because when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), it will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because each term in the second expansion will multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term, contributing their own coefficients. \n\nWait, that seems plausible. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 (from the first part) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But how do I find the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)? \n\nI remember that the sum of the coefficients in a polynomial is found by plugging in 1 for all variables. So, if I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) becomes \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of all coefficients in the second part is 64. \n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nWait, but let me check if that's correct. Alternatively, maybe I should think of it as each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) being multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since we're only interested in the \\(a^2b^2\\) term, the coefficient would just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the entire expansion of the second part. But that's the same as saying 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second part, which is 6*64=384. \n\nWait, but I'm not sure if that's the right approach. Let me think again. When you multiply two expressions, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by every term in the second part, which is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of c, that means we're considering all possible combinations where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any term from the second expansion. \n\nWait, but that would mean the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of the second part, which is 6*(something). But that can't be, because the coefficient should be a number, not a polynomial. So, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. \n\nWait, maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some k, but it just says \\(a^2b^2\\). Hmm, but the expression also has c terms, so perhaps the question is considering the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, regardless of the c terms. But that would mean the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion, which is a polynomial in c, but the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. \n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me try a different approach. Let me expand both parts separately and then see how the terms interact. \n\nFirst, \\((a + b)^4\\) expands to \\(a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\), as I found earlier. \n\nNow, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) can be expanded using the binomial theorem as well. So, that would be \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). \n\nSo, the expansion is \\(\\dbinom{6}{0}c^6 + \\dbinom{6}{1}c^4 + \\dbinom{6}{2}c^2 + \\dbinom{6}{3}c^0 + \\dbinom{6}{4}c^{-2} + \\dbinom{6}{5}c^{-4} + \\dbinom{6}{6}c^{-6}\\). \n\nCalculating the coefficients: \n\n- \\(k=0\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{0}=1\\), term is \\(c^6\\)\n- \\(k=1\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{1}=6\\), term is \\(6c^4\\)\n- \\(k=2\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{2}=15\\), term is \\(15c^2\\)\n- \\(k=3\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}=20\\), term is \\(20c^0 = 20\\)\n- \\(k=4\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{4}=15\\), term is \\(15c^{-2}\\)\n- \\(k=5\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{5}=6\\), term is \\(6c^{-4}\\)\n- \\(k=6\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{6}=1\\), term is \\(c^{-6}\\)\n\nSo, the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is \\(c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15/c^2 + 6/c^4 + 1/c^6\\).\n\nNow, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), etc. \n\nBut the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, but in the product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would only come from \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by the constant term (i.e., the term without c) in the second expansion. Because if I multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by \\(c^6\\), I get \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), which is a different term. Similarly, multiplying by \\(c^4\\) gives \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), etc. The only way to get a term that's just \\(a^2b^2\\) without any c's is if I multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by the constant term in the second expansion. \n\nWait, that makes more sense. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) (the constant term) in the second part. \n\nFrom the first part, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. From the second part, the constant term is 20. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was 6 * 64 = 384, but that was when I considered multiplying by all terms, but that would actually give me the coefficient if I were looking for \\(a^2b^2\\) times any c term. But the problem is just asking for \\(a^2b^2\\), so I think I was wrong before. The correct approach is to realize that the only way to get a term with just \\(a^2b^2\\) is to multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by the constant term in the second expansion, which is 20. \n\nSo, the coefficient would be 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nWait, let me verify that again. If I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the product of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion and the constant term (c^0) in the second expansion. Because any other term in the second expansion would introduce a c term, making it \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some k, which is not just \\(a^2b^2\\). So, yes, the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because earlier I thought about the sum of coefficients, but that's when you're considering all terms, but in this case, we're only interested in the specific term without c. So, I think 120 is the correct answer. \n\nAlternatively, let me consider the entire product. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be present in the product only when we take \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part and multiply it by the constant term from the second part. So, yes, 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in calculating the constant term. From the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the constant term is when the exponent of c is zero, which happens when 6 - 2k = 0, so k = 3. So, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So that's correct. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nWait, but just to be thorough, let me think about how the multiplication works. If I have \\((a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15c^{-2} + 6c^{-4} + c^{-6}\\), then when I multiply them, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will come from \\(6a^2b^2\\) multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But only when multiplied by the constant term will it result in a term with just \\(a^2b^2\\). All other multiplications will result in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), etc., which are not just \\(a^2b^2\\). \n\nTherefore, the coefficient is indeed 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nWait, but earlier I thought of 6 * 64 = 384, but that would be if I were considering the sum of all coefficients, which is 64, but that's not the case here. So, 120 must be the correct answer. \n\nI think I've got it now. The coefficient is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by considering the expansion of each part separately and then identifying the relevant terms.\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\dbinom{4}{0}a^4 + \\dbinom{4}{1}a^3b + \\dbinom{4}{2}a^2b^2 + \\dbinom{4}{3}ab^3 + \\dbinom{4}{4}b^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\n   \\]\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6.\n\n2. **Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n   \\]\n   The constant term (where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0) occurs when \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), so \\(k = 3\\). The coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n\n3. **Multiply the coefficients:**\n   The term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will only be formed by multiplying \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion by the constant term from the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient is:\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 20 = 120\n   \\]\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

    "text": " \n\nThe problem is asking specifically for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). That means I'm looking for the term where the powers of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2. Since the exponent on \\((a + b)\\) is 4, I can set up the binomial coefficient for that part. \n\nLet me write down the expansion for \\((a + b)^4\\). According to the binomial theorem, this would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{0}a^4 + \\dbinom{4}{1}a^3b + \\dbinom{4}{2}a^2b^2 + \\dbinom{4}{3}ab^3 + \\dbinom{4}{4}b^4\\). So, looking for \\(a^2b^2\\), that's the third term, right? The term where \\(k = 2\\), because \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}a^{4 - 2}b^2 = \\dbinom{4}{2}a^2b^2\\). \n\nCalculating \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\), that's \\(\\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. \n\nBut wait, the original expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I also need to consider the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Hmm, does that affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)? Let me think. \n\nWell, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is only from the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), and the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), is multiplied by it. So, when I multiply the two expansions together, each term from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term from the second expansion. \n\nBut since I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term from the first expansion, I need to see if the second expansion affects it. Wait, actually, no. Because \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), so when I multiply it by any term from the second expansion, it will just be \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by some term involving \\(c\\). \n\nBut the question is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). That is, the coefficient in the entire expression. But in the entire expression, \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by each term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the sum of all those products. Wait, but that doesn't make sense because \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term on its own, and when multiplied by other terms, it would create terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2c^{-k}\\), but the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) itself would just be the same as the coefficient in the first expansion, right? \n\nWait, no, maybe I'm confusing myself. Let me think again. If I have two separate polynomials multiplied together, the coefficients of the terms in the product are the products of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each polynomial. But in this case, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is present only in the first polynomial, and the second polynomial has terms involving \\(c\\). So, when I multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second polynomial, I get terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), etc., but none of these will be just \\(a^2b^2\\); they will all have additional factors of \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\). \n\nWait, so does that mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is zero? Because there's no term without \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\) in the second polynomial, so when you multiply, you can't get a term that's just \\(a^2b^2\\). Hmm, that seems possible, but let me check that again. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Maybe it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). But usually, when a problem asks for the coefficient of a specific term, it's considering the entire expression, including all variables. So, if the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any power of \\(c\\), then the coefficient would be the coefficient from the first part times the coefficient from the second part for each term, and then all those would be added together. \n\nWait, but in this case, \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), so when multiplied by the second polynomial, which has terms in \\(c\\), the result will be \\(a^2b^2\\) times each term in the second polynomial. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would actually be the sum of the coefficients from the second polynomial multiplied by the coefficient from the first polynomial. \n\nWait, that doesn't make sense because \\(a^2b^2\\) isn't present in the second polynomial. Let me clarify: The entire expression is the product of two polynomials, one in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the other in \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, when you multiply them, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial, which are terms like \\(c^6\\), \\(6c^4\\), \\(15c^2\\), \\(20\\), \\(15c^{-2}\\), \\(6c^{-4}\\), and \\(c^{-6}\\). \n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, multiplied by each coefficient from the second part, but only the constant term would contribute to a term that is just \\(a^2b^2\\), right? Because if you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by \\(c^k\\), you get \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), which is a different term. So, the only term that would result in \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms is when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by the constant term in the second polynomial, which is the middle term of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nSo, let me find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). \n\nWe need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, because that's the constant term. So, set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\). So, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} c^{0} = \\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). \n\nTherefore, the constant term in the second polynomial is 20. So, when we multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first polynomial by this constant term, we get \\(6 \\times 20 \\times a^2b^2 = 120a^2b^2\\). \n\nWait, but does that mean the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120? Or am I missing something? Let me check again. \n\nSo, the first part gives 6 for \\(a^2b^2\\), and the second part, when considering the constant term, gives 20. So, the product would be 6 * 20 = 120. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120. \n\nWait, but let me make sure that I'm not making a mistake here. Because sometimes, when you have multiple variables, the coefficients can interact differently. But in this case, since \\(a^2b^2\\) is from the first polynomial and the constant term is from the second, their product is just the product of their coefficients, and the variables multiply as well, giving \\(a^2b^2c^0 = a^2b^2\\). So, yes, the coefficient is 120. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I should think of the entire expression as a product of two polynomials and consider that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the sum over all possible products of coefficients from each polynomial that result in the term \\(a^2b^2\\). But in this case, since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) is to multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first polynomial by the constant term from the second polynomial. \n\nSo, that would be 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient is 120. \n\nWait, but let me double-check the binomial coefficients to make sure I didn't make a mistake there. \n\nFor the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\), which is correct. \n\nFor the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the constant term is when \\(k = 3\\), so \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\), which is also correct. \n\nSo, multiplying them together, 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120. \n\nI think that makes sense. So, the final answer should be 120. \n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem.\n\nFirst, consider the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n\\]\nThe term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\), so the coefficient is:\n\\[\n\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\n\\]\n\nNext, consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem:\n\\[\n\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n\\]\nWe need the constant term, which occurs when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. This happens when \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), giving \\(k = 3\\). The coefficient is:\n\\[\n\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\n\\]\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficients from each part:\n\\[\n6 \\times 20 = 120\n\\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}."

Wait, but the second part involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), which are different variables. Since the first part is only about \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), maybe the \\(c\\) terms don't affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). That might be the case because \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) are separate variables, so when multiplying, the coefficients from each part multiply together. \n\nSo, perhaps I can handle each part separately. Let me first focus on expanding \\((a + b)^4\\) and find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) there. Then, I can find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) because when I multiply the two parts together, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will be multiplied by every term in the second expansion, but only the term with \\(c^0\\) (which is just a constant) will contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the final product. \n\nWait, let me make sure I understand that. If I have \\((a + b)^4\\) times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), then when I multiply them, each term in the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first expansion, and I need to find which term in the second expansion, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), will result in a term that still has \\(a^2b^2\\). Since the second expansion is in terms of \\(c\\), any power of \\(c\\) in that term would mean that the resulting term would have \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2 \\cdot \\dfrac{1}{c^k}\\), but the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which implies that we are looking for the term where the power of \\(c\\) is zero. Because any other power would make it a different term, not just \\(a^2b^2\\). \n\nSo, yes, I think that's the right approach. So, first, I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), and then find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), and then multiply those two coefficients together to get the final coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression. \n\nStarting with \\((a + b)^4\\). Using the binomial theorem, the expansion is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) occurs when \\(4 - k = 2\\), which means \\(k = 2\\). So, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Let me compute that: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. \n\nNow, moving on to the second part: \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\), which is the constant term. Again, using the binomial theorem, the expansion is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying the exponents, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m} = \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). \n\nWe want the exponent of \\(c\\) to be zero, so we set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the term where \\(m = 3\\) is the constant term. The coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. \n\nNow, since the original expression is the product of \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficients we found from each part. That is, 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the second part). So, 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nWait, let me just double-check to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For \\((a + b)^4\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed when \\(k = 2\\), so the coefficient is 6. For the second part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the constant term occurs when the exponent is zero, which is when \\(m = 3\\), so the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying these together gives 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nIs there any chance I missed something? Let me think. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), so it's just the product of the coefficients from each part. I don't think there's any interaction between \\(a\\) and \\(c\\) or \\(b\\) and \\(c\\), so I don't have to worry about cross terms or anything like that. So, I think 120 is the correct coefficient. \n\nAnother way to think about it is that when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficients multiply for the corresponding terms. So, since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term in the first polynomial and the constant term is a term in the second polynomial, their product will give the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the overall product, and the coefficient is the product of their individual coefficients. \n\nI think that's solid.

The term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\) in the expansion, giving a coefficient of \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n\nNext, we find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).

So, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term is part of the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\), and when I multiply it by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), I need to consider how that affects the coefficient. \n\nHmm, but wait a second. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are only in the first part of the product, \\((a + b)^4\\), and the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), only involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), which are different variables. So, does that mean that when I multiply the two expansions together, the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) won't interfere with the terms involving \\(c\\)? \n\nLet me think. If I have two separate polynomials multiplied together, each term from the first polynomial is multiplied by each term from the second. So, for example, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are all different variables, the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) won't combine with the terms involving \\(c\\). \n\nSo, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I just need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), and then multiply it by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because the \\(a^2b^2\\) term doesn't get affected by the \\(c\\) terms. \n\nWait, but that doesn't sound quite right. Because when you multiply two polynomials, each term from the first is multiplied by each term from the second, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nBut actually, no, that's not correct either. Because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\) at all. So, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part, each of which is a power of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nWait, but that would make the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) equal to 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not considering \\(c\\). So, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. \n\nWait, perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion of the entire expression, treating \\(c\\) as another variable. So, the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that seems odd because the coefficient should be a numerical value, not a polynomial. \n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me read the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, perhaps the problem is treating all variables as separate, and the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the entire second part, which is a sum of terms involving \\(c\\). \n\nBut that doesn't make sense because the coefficient should be a number, not involving \\(c\\). Hmm, maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when considering all the terms, but since \\(c\\) is another variable, the coefficient would just be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems too complicated. \n\nWait, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. That is, when you multiply out the entire expression, what is the coefficient for the term \\(a^2b^2\\) times some combination of \\(c\\) terms. But the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would then be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial. \n\nBut that doesn't seem right because usually, when you're asked for the coefficient of a specific term in a product, you might be looking for a numerical coefficient if the variables are separate. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering only the coefficients and variables separately, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, and the rest is part of the other terms. \n\nWait, I'm getting confused. Let me try a different approach. Maybe I can expand both parts separately and then see how they multiply. \n\nFirst, expand \\((a + b)^4\\). Using the binomial theorem, as I did before, the expansion is:\n\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\dbinom{4}{0}a^4b^0 + \\dbinom{4}{1}a^3b^1 + \\dbinom{4}{2}a^2b^2 + \\dbinom{4}{3}a^1b^3 + \\dbinom{4}{4}a^0b^4\n\\]\n\nCalculating each term:\n\n- \\(\\dbinom{4}{0} = 1\\), so the first term is \\(a^4\\).\n- \\(\\dbinom{4}{1} = 4\\), so the second term is \\(4a^3b\\).\n- \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\), so the third term is \\(6a^2b^2\\).\n- \\(\\dbinom{4}{3} = 4\\), so the fourth term is \\(4ab^3\\).\n- \\(\\dbinom{4}{4} = 1\\), so the last term is \\(b^4\\).\n\nSo, the expansion is \\(a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\).\n\nNow, the second part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me expand that using the binomial theorem as well. The general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - k}\\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\\).\n\nSo, the expansion would be:\n\n\\[\n\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\n\\]\n\nCalculating each term:\n\n- For \\(k = 0\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{0}c^{6} = 1 \\cdot c^6 = c^6\\)\n- For \\(k = 1\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{1}c^{4} = 6c^4\\)\n- For \\(k = 2\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{2}c^{2} = 15c^2\\)\n- For \\(k = 3\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}c^{0} = 20 \\cdot 1 = 20\\)\n- For \\(k = 4\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{4}c^{-2} = 15c^{-2}\\)\n- For \\(k = 5\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{5}c^{-4} = 6c^{-4}\\)\n- For \\(k = 6\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{6}c^{-6} = 1c^{-6}\\)\n\nSo, the expansion is \\(c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15c^{-2} + 6c^{-4} + c^{-6}\\).\n\nNow, the original expression is the product of these two expansions:\n\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = (a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4)(c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15c^{-2} + 6c^{-4} + c^{-6})\n\\]\n\nI need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Looking at the first expansion, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term is \\(6a^2b^2\\). When I multiply this by the entire second expansion, each term in the second expansion will multiply \\(6a^2b^2\\), resulting in terms like \\(6a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(36a^2b^2c^4\\), etc. \n\nBut the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which implies that we are looking for the coefficient when \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by some combination of \\(c\\) terms. However, since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a separate term from the \\(c\\) terms, the coefficient would actually be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire second expansion. \n\nWait, but that doesn't make sense because the coefficient should be a number, not a polynomial. Maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). But that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial. \n\nBut that seems odd because usually, when you're asked for the coefficient of a specific term, it's a numerical coefficient. Maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Perhaps it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times a specific power of \\(c\\), but the problem doesn't specify any power of \\(c\\). \n\nWait, perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating \\(c\\) as another variable. So, the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems complicated. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is expecting me to consider that since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are different variables, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, and the rest is part of the other terms involving \\(c\\). But that seems too simplistic. \n\nWait, let me think again. When you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) from the first polynomial will be multiplied by each term in the second polynomial, resulting in terms like \\(6a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(36a^2b^2c^4\\), etc. So, in the entire product, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the sum of all the coefficients from the second polynomial, because each term in the second polynomial is multiplied by \\(6a^2b^2\\). \n\nWait, that makes sense. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 multiplied by the sum of the coefficients of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because each term in the second expansion contributes its coefficient times \\(6a^2b^2\\), so when you collect all the terms with \\(a^2b^2\\), their coefficients are \\(6 \\times\\) each coefficient from the second expansion. \n\nBut wait, no. Actually, when you multiply \\(6a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, you get terms like \\(6 \\times \\text{coefficient of } c^k \\times a^2b^2c^k\\). So, each of these terms would have a different power of \\(c\\), but the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) itself would be the sum of all the coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by 6. \n\nWait, but that's not correct either. Because each term in the product is a separate term with different powers of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is just 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial. \n\nBut the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term in the product. So, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), that is, the constant term with respect to \\(c\\). \n\nWait, that might make sense. So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, and considering that \\(c\\) is another variable, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by the constant term (with respect to \\(c\\)) from the second expansion. \n\nSo, in the second expansion, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the constant term is when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. From the expansion I did earlier, the constant term is 20. \n\nSo, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), which is just \\(a^2b^2\\), then the coefficient would be 6 times 20, which is 120. \n\nWait, that seems plausible. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 times the constant term of the second expansion, which is 20, giving 120. \n\nBut let me verify that. Let's think about it: when you multiply \\(6a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, the only term that doesn't involve \\(c\\) is the constant term, which is 20. So, multiplying \\(6a^2b^2\\) by 20 gives \\(120a^2b^2\\), which is the term with \\(a^2b^2\\) and no \\(c\\) terms. \n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 120. \n\nAlternatively, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, meaning the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by 6, that would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nBut the sum of the coefficients in a polynomial is found by setting all variables to 1. So, setting \\(c = 1\\), \\(\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = (2)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the sum of the coefficients is 64. \n\nSo, 6 times 64 is 384. But that would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) if we were considering the entire product as a polynomial in \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\), and we were summing over all coefficients, but that's not what the problem is asking. The problem is specifically asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which, as I thought earlier, is 120, considering only the constant term in \\(c\\). \n\nWait, but maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me think again. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are in one part, and \\(c\\) is in another, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the entire second expansion. But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because coefficients are numerical. \n\nTherefore, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, considering all possible terms with \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by any power of \\(c\\). But in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial, but that's not a numerical coefficient. \n\nWait, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable, but the coefficient is just the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, and the rest is part of the other terms. But that seems incorrect because when you multiply, the coefficients combine. \n\nWait, maybe I should consider that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, as I calculated earlier. So, 6 times 64 is 384. \n\nBut that seems too large, and I'm not sure if that's what the problem is asking. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and the second part is just a distraction. But that seems unlikely because the problem includes both parts. \n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, maybe the problem is treating all variables as separate, and the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, and the rest is part of the other terms involving \\(c\\). \n\nBut that doesn't seem right because when you multiply, the coefficients do combine. So, for example, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part, each of which has a coefficient. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients from the second expansion. \n\nWait, but the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion is when \\(c = 1\\), which is \\(2^6 = 64\\), as I calculated before. So, 6 times 64 is 384. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 384. \n\nBut I'm not entirely sure. Let me think about it differently. Suppose I have two polynomials, P(a, b) and Q(c). Then, the product P(a, b) * Q(c) would have terms that are products of terms from P and terms from Q. So, the coefficient of a specific term in P, say \\(a^2b^2\\), would be the coefficient of that term in P multiplied by the entire Q(c). \n\nBut that would mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 * Q(c), which is a polynomial. But the problem is asking for the coefficient, which should be a number, not a polynomial. Therefore, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, considering that the entire product is a polynomial in \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\). \n\nIn that case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient from the first part, 6, multiplied by each coefficient from the second part, resulting in a polynomial. But again, that doesn't make sense because the coefficient should be a number. \n\nWait, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating \\(c\\) as a variable, but only considering the terms where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out, i.e., \\(c^0\\). So, that would mean the coefficient is 6 times the constant term of the second expansion, which is 20, giving 120. \n\nThat seems more plausible. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the constant term of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20, resulting in 120. \n\nLet me check that again. The constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, which occurs when \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), so \\(k = 3\\). The coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, yes, the constant term is 20. \n\nTherefore, when I multiply \\(6a^2b^2\\) by 20, I get \\(120a^2b^2\\), which is the term in the product where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 120. \n\nWait, but if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, then it's 120. If it's asking for the sum of all coefficients multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), that would be 6 times 64, which is 384. But I think the problem is more likely asking for the coefficient when considering only the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\), which is 120. \n\nSo, to summarize:\n\n1. Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is 6.\n\n2. Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem and find the constant term (where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero), which is 20.\n\n3. Multiply these two coefficients together to get the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, which is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplying it by the constant term (with respect to \\(c\\)) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20. Therefore, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

    "text": " \n\nAlright, so let's start with the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\). Using the binomial theorem, this should expand to \\(\\dbinom{4}{0}a^4b^0 + \\dbinom{4}{1}a^3b^1 + \\dbinom{4}{2}a^2b^2 + \\dbinom{4}{3}a^1b^3 + \\dbinom{4}{4}a^0b^4\\). Simplifying the coefficients, that would be \\(1 \\cdot a^4 + 4 \\cdot a^3b + 6 \\cdot a^2b^2 + 4 \\cdot ab^3 + 1 \\cdot b^4\\). \n\nWait, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in this part is 6. But the problem is asking for the coefficient in the entire expression, which is \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Hmm, that means I can't just stop here. I need to consider the entire product. \n\nSo, the expression is a product of two binomials raised to powers: one in terms of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the other in terms of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). But wait, when I multiply two expressions together, the variables multiply as well. So, in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term from the second expansion. \n\nBut here's the thing: the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), only has terms with \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), while the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), only has terms with \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, when I multiply them together, the variables from the first part (\\(a\\) and \\(b\\)) will be multiplied by the variables from the second part (\\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\)). \n\nWait a second, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). But in the entire expression, the terms from the second part involve \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), which are different variables. So, does that mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just the coefficient from the first part, because the second part doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms? \n\nLet me think. If I have \\( (a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 \\), then each term in the expansion of the first part is multiplied by each term in the expansion of the second part. So, for example, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) from the first part would be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, which are like \\(c^6\\), \\(6c^5 \\times \\dfrac{1}{c}\\), and so on. \n\nBut the problem is asking specifically for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, in the entire product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by every term from the second expansion. That means the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is actually \\(6 \\times\\) the sum of all the coefficients from the second expansion, because each term from the second expansion will be multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). \n\nWait, is that right? Let me clarify. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient from the first part, \\(6\\), multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients from the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But hold on, the second part isn't just a constant; it's a polynomial in \\(c\\). So, when we multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, each of those will contribute to different terms in the final product. \n\nBut the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Since the second expansion only involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), multiplying \\(a^2b^2\\) by any term from the second expansion will result in a term that has \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by some power of \\(c\\). So, in the entire product, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is actually the same as the coefficient in the first part, because the second part doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) variables. \n\nWait, that doesn't seem right. Let me think again. If I have \\( (a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 \\), then each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, for example, \\(a^4\\) from the first part is multiplied by \\(c^6\\), \\(6c^5 \\times \\dfrac{1}{c}\\), and so on. Similarly, \\(a^3b\\) is multiplied by all those terms, and \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by all those terms as well. \n\nBut when we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), we're only interested in the terms where the power of \\(a\\) is 2 and the power of \\(b\\) is 2. The rest of the variables, \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), can be anything because the problem doesn't specify anything about them. So, does that mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part? Or is it more complicated than that? \n\nWait, no. Because each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients in the second part. Because each term in the second part contributes a coefficient that gets multiplied by the 6 from the first part. \n\nSo, in other words, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, the sum of all the coefficients in a polynomial is found by plugging in 1 for all the variables. So, for the second part, if I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = (2)^6 = 64\\). \n\nTherefore, the sum of all the coefficients in the second part is 64. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times 64, which is 384. \n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. Let me go through it again. The problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. Now, when I multiply this by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the expansion of the first part is multiplied by each term in the expansion of the second part. \n\nSo, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. Each of these products will have the form \\(6a^2b^2 \\times \\text{something}\\), where \"something\" is a term from the second expansion. However, since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\), the coefficient will be 6 multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients from the second expansion. \n\nBut wait, actually, no. Because each term in the second expansion has different powers of \\(c\\), but the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is actually the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. However, since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the other variables, the coefficient would indeed be 6 multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64. \n\nSo, 6 times 64 is 384. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 384. \n\nWait, but let me check if that's correct. Let me think about the entire expansion. So, \\((a + b)^4\\) gives terms up to \\(a^4\\) and \\(b^4\\), and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) gives terms from \\(c^6\\) down to \\(c^{-6}\\). When I multiply them, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by every term in the second part, which has coefficients from 1 to 64 when summed. \n\nBut the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all coefficients from the second part. So, yes, 6 times 64 is 384. \n\nAlternatively, another way to think about it is that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is equal to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire second expansion, because the second expansion doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just 6 times the entire second expansion, which is 6 times 64, giving 384. \n\nWait, but hold on a second. The second expansion is a polynomial in \\(c\\), so it's not a constant. So, when we multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, we get terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(6a^2b^2c^5 \\times \\dfrac{1}{c}\\), and so on. So, each of these terms will have different powers of \\(c\\), but the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is actually just 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in the second expansion, because each term in the second expansion contributes its coefficient to the term \\(a^2b^2\\) when multiplied by the 6. \n\nSo, to confirm, the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is indeed \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 times 64, which is 384. \n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not confusing coefficients with terms. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the sum of all the coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by the 6 from the first part. So, yes, 6 times 64 is 384. \n\nAlternatively, if I were to write out the entire product, each term would be of the form \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}a^{4 - k}b^k \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - m} \\times \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\), which simplifies to \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}\\dbinom{6}{m}a^{4 - k}b^k c^{6 - 2m}\\). \n\nNow, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), that corresponds to \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). So, \\(k = 2\\), which gives \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Then, for each \\(m\\) from 0 to 6, we have \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\) multiplied by the 6. So, the total coefficient would be 6 times the sum of \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\) for \\(m = 0\\) to \\(6\\), which is 6 times \\(2^6 = 64\\), so 6 times 64 is 384. \n\nYes, that seems consistent. So, I think the coefficient is 384. \n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the binomial coefficients. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - m} \\times \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, each term has a coefficient of \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\) and a power of \\(c\\) as \\(6 - 2m\\). \n\nSo, when I multiply this by the first part, which has a term \\(6a^2b^2\\), the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be 6 times the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion, because each term in the second expansion is multiplied by \\(6a^2b^2\\), contributing \\(6 \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}\\) to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^{6 - 2m}\\). \n\nBut since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), the coefficient is just 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 times 64, so 384. \n\nWait, but another way to think about it is that when you have two polynomials multiplied together, the coefficient of a specific term in one polynomial is multiplied by the entire other polynomial. So, in this case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial is 6, and when you multiply by the second polynomial, which is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) becomes 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nBut since we're only interested in the coefficient, not the variables, we need to find the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), giving \\(2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient is 6 times 64, which is 384. \n\nI think that makes sense. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplying it by the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The sum of the coefficients in the second expression is \\(2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n\\boxed{384}"

    "text": " The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so I need to find the term where the powers of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2. That means I need to find the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\). \n\nLet me write that out. The expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{0}a^4b^0 + \\dbinom{4}{1}a^3b^1 + \\dbinom{4}{2}a^2b^2 + \\dbinom{4}{3}a^1b^3 + \\dbinom{4}{4}a^0b^4\\). So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Let me calculate that: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient from the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), is 6. \n\nNow, the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). That term is only in the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), right? Because the second part is in terms of \\(c\\), so when we multiply them together, the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms won't be affected by the \\(c\\) terms. So, does that mean the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just 6? Hmm, maybe that's too quick. Let me think again.\n\nWait, no, because when you multiply two expressions together, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part will be multiplied by every term in the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not considering any \\(c\\) terms. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, no, that doesn't make sense because the \\(c\\) terms are separate from the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. So, actually, when you multiply them, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will just be multiplied by each term in the \\(c\\) expansion, but since we're only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, the coefficient would just be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in the \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) expansion. But that seems too broad because the problem might be expecting a specific coefficient, not multiplied by all the \\(c\\) terms.\n\nWait, maybe I misread the problem. Let me check: It says, \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, actually, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is independent of \\(c\\), so when you multiply the two expressions, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will be multiplied by each term in the \\(c\\) expansion, but since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, the coefficient would just be the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part, but that doesn't make sense because the coefficient can't be a polynomial. Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating this.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, without considering the \\(c\\) terms. So, in other words, the \\(c\\) part is just another factor, but the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, because the \\(c\\) terms don't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. So, the coefficient is 6. But let me double-check.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is expecting me to consider the entire expression and find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second part, which are terms involving \\(c^6\\), \\(c^4\\), \\(c^2\\), \\(c^0\\), \\(c^{-2}\\), \\(c^{-4}\\), \\(c^{-6}\\). But since the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), we need to sum up all the coefficients from the second part and multiply by 6. Wait, but that would give us the total coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) times every possible power of \\(c\\), which isn't what the problem is asking. The problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so I think the answer is just 6 because the \\(c\\) terms are separate and don't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms.\n\nWait, but let me think again. If I have \\((a + b)^4\\) times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), then when you expand it, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), so that would be \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, the coefficient would be 6 * 64 = 384. Wait, but that seems too high. Let me see.\n\nWait, no, that approach might not be correct. Because when you set \\(c = 1\\), you get the sum of all the coefficients, but in reality, each term in the second expansion has different powers of \\(c\\), so when you multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), each of those terms would have a coefficient, and the total coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in the second expansion. But that would mean the coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384. But that seems like a lot. Let me check that again.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but it's in the product of two expressions. So, actually, each term in the product is a combination of a term from \\((a + b)^4\\) and a term from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the first expression, and it's multiplied by every term from the second expression. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part, but that doesn't make sense because the coefficient can't be a polynomial. So, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which would just be 6.\n\nWait, but that seems too simple. Maybe I'm missing something. Let me think differently. Perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some specific \\(k\\), but it's not specified. Wait, no, the problem just says the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so perhaps it's considering all possible powers of \\(c\\), and just wants the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. But I'm not sure if that's correct.\n\nWait, let me try to approach it another way. Let's expand both expressions separately and then see how the terms combine. The expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is as I did before, with the term \\(a^2b^2\\) having a coefficient of 6. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) can be done using the binomial theorem as well. So, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(1/c\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\).\n\nSo, the expansion has terms with exponents of \\(c\\) ranging from \\(6\\) (when \\(k=0\\)) to \\(-6\\) (when \\(k=6\\)), in steps of 2. Each term has a coefficient of \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}\\). Now, when we multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, which are terms like \\(c^6\\), \\(6c^4\\), \\(15c^2\\), \\(20c^0\\), \\(15c^{-2}\\), \\(6c^{-4}\\), \\(c^{-6}\\).\n\nSo, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be \\(6 \\times c^6 a^2b^2\\), \\(6 \\times 6c^4 a^2b^2\\), \\(6 \\times 15c^2 a^2b^2\\), \\(6 \\times 20c^0 a^2b^2\\), \\(6 \\times 15c^{-2} a^2b^2\\), \\(6 \\times 6c^{-4} a^2b^2\\), \\(6 \\times c^{-6} a^2b^2\\). So, each of these terms has a different power of \\(c\\), but the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\) would be the sum of all these coefficients. So, the coefficient would be 6*(1 + 6 + 15 + 20 + 15 + 6 + 1) = 6*(64) = 384.\n\nWait, but that seems like a lot. Let me check that. The sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is indeed found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of the coefficients is 64, and since the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, the total coefficient would be 6*64 = 384. But I'm not sure if that's what the problem is asking for. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but without specifying any power of \\(c\\), so perhaps it's expecting the sum of all coefficients where the term is \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) power. So, that would be 384.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable, so the coefficient would be 6, as the \\(c\\) terms don't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. But that seems contradictory because when you multiply, the coefficients do get multiplied.\n\nWait, perhaps I should think of it differently. If I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then each time \\(a^2b^2\\) appears in the product, it's multiplied by a term from the \\(c\\) expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in the \\(c\\) expansion, which is 6*64=384. So, maybe that's the answer.\n\nBut wait, another way to think about it is that when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in one polynomial is multiplied by the entire other polynomial. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which would make it a polynomial, but the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, so that can't be right. Therefore, perhaps the problem is only considering the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms, meaning that the \\(c\\) part must be \\(c^0\\), which is 1. So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\).\n\nSo, let's find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem, the general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We want the exponent of \\(c\\) to be 0, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\). So, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, that makes more sense. Because if we're looking for the term \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by \\(c^0\\), then the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120. But the problem didn't specify any power of \\(c\\), just \\(a^2b^2\\). Hmm, now I'm confused again. Is the problem asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), or specifically when multiplied by \\(c^0\\)? \n\nWait, the problem says, \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)\". So, in the entire product, each term is of the form \\(a^kb^{4 - k}c^{m}\\), where \\(k\\) ranges from 0 to 4, and \\(m\\) ranges from -6 to 6 in steps of 2. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be present in the product with various powers of \\(c\\). So, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then it's the sum over all coefficients where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any power of \\(c\\). That would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6*64=384.\n\nBut if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it's 6*20=120. But the problem didn't specify any power of \\(c\\), just \\(a^2b^2\\). So, perhaps it's the first case, 384. But I'm not sure. Maybe I should check the problem statement again.\n\nWait, the problem is: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, it's just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6*64=384.\n\nBut wait, that seems too large. Let me think differently. Maybe the problem is expecting me to consider that the entire expression is a product, and the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just 6, because the \\(c\\) terms are separate. But that doesn't seem right because when you multiply, the coefficients do combine.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting me to treat \\(c\\) as a separate variable and just find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which would be 6 times the entire expansion of the second part, but that's not a numerical coefficient. So, perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and the second part is just a separate expansion, so the coefficient remains 6.\n\nWait, but that doesn't make sense because the entire expression is a product, so the coefficients would multiply. So, perhaps the correct approach is to consider that the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first part with coefficient 6, and it's multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6*64=384.\n\nBut I'm not entirely confident. Let me try to think of a simpler example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^1 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, expanding, we get \\((a + b)(c + 1/c)\\). The coefficient of \\(a\\) would be 1*(c + 1/c), so the coefficient of \\(a\\) is the entire expansion of \\(c + 1/c\\). But that's not a numerical coefficient. So, perhaps in that case, the coefficient of \\(a\\) is just 1, and the \\(c\\) terms are separate.\n\nWait, but in reality, when you multiply, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a\\) in the first part is multiplied by \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), so the coefficient of \\(a\\) in the product would be \\(c + 1/c\\), which is not a numerical coefficient. So, perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and the second part is just another expansion that doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. So, the coefficient remains 6.\n\nWait, but that can't be right because when you multiply two expressions, the coefficients do combine. So, if I have \\((a + b)^4\\) times something, the coefficients of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the entire second expression. But that's not a numerical coefficient; it's a polynomial. So, perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and the second part is irrelevant because it's in terms of \\(c\\). So, the answer is 6.\n\nBut I'm still unsure. Let me try to see what others might do. Maybe the problem is expecting me to recognize that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just 6, because the other part is in terms of \\(c\\), so it doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) coefficients. So, the answer is 6.\n\nWait, but that seems too simple, and I remember that when you multiply two polynomials, each term in one is multiplied by each term in the other, so the coefficients do combine. So, perhaps the correct approach is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and then realize that in the product, this term is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in the second expansion. The sum of the coefficients in the second expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, the total coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nBut I'm not sure if that's the correct interpretation. Alternatively, maybe the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and the second part is just another factor that doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. So, the coefficient remains 6.\n\nWait, perhaps I should look for similar problems or examples. For example, if I have \\((a + b)^n \\times (c + d)^m\\), the coefficient of \\(a^kb^{n - k}\\) would be \\(\\dbinom{n}{k}\\), and the coefficient of \\(c^ld^{m - l}\\) would be \\(\\dbinom{m}{l}\\). But in the product, each term from the first is multiplied by each term from the second, so the coefficient of \\(a^kb^{n - k}c^ld^{m - l}\\) would be \\(\\dbinom{n}{k}\\dbinom{m}{l}\\). But if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^kb^{n - k}\\) regardless of \\(c\\) and \\(d\\), then it would be \\(\\dbinom{n}{k}\\) times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial, which is \\((1 + 1)^m = 2^m\\). So, in this case, the coefficient would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} \\times 2^6 = 6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\nSo, applying that logic here, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 * 64 = 384. So, that seems to be the answer.\n\nWait, but let me confirm that. If I have \\((a + b)^4\\) times \\((c + 1/c)^6\\), and I want the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then it's the coefficient from the first part, 6, multiplied by the sum of all coefficients from the second part, which is 64, giving 384. That seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it's 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion, which is 20, giving 120. But the problem didn't specify any power of \\(c\\), so I think the correct interpretation is that it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), so the answer would be 384.\n\nWait, but I'm still a bit unsure. Let me try to think of it another way. Suppose I set \\(c = 1\\), then the expression becomes \\((a + b)^4 \\times (1 + 1)^6 = (a + b)^4 \\times 64\\). Then, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in this case would be 6 * 64 = 384, which matches what I found earlier. So, that seems to confirm that the answer is 384.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is 384.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{384}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break it down into two parts using the binomial theorem.\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\):\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\n   \\]\n   So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\n2. **Consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n   \\]\n   The sum of all coefficients in this expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\):\n   \\[\n   (1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\n   \\]\n\n3. **Combine the results:**\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) and the sum of the coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 64 = 384\n   \\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\boxed{384}\\)."

    "text": " The problem is asking specifically for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so I need to find the term where \\(a\\) is squared and \\(b\\) is squared in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\). Let me write that out. \n\nFirst, let's consider \\((a + b)^4\\). Using the binomial theorem, each term in the expansion is \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}a^{4 - k}b^k\\) for \\(k = 0\\) to \\(4\\). So, the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) occurs would be when \\(4 - k = 2\\) for \\(a\\) and \\(k = 2\\) for \\(b\\). That means \\(k = 2\\). So, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Let me compute that. \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) is \\(\\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. \n\nBut wait, the original expression is \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the entire expression is the product of two binomial expansions. So, when I expand both parts, I'll have terms from each expansion multiplied together. However, the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). That means I don't need to consider the terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\) because those are separate variables. So, maybe I can treat \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) as separate parts and just find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, and then consider the entire expression. \n\nWait, but actually, when you multiply two expressions, the coefficients multiply as well. So, if I have \\((a + b)^4\\) times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the terms in the product will be combinations of terms from each expansion. But since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\), and \\(1/c\\) are different variables, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part will be multiplied by every term in the second part. But the question is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would be the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire second part, because \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\). \n\nWait, no, that's not quite right. Let me think again. When you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), then in the product, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will be multiplied by every term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). However, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems a bit confusing because the coefficient would actually be a polynomial in \\(c\\). \n\nWait, no, actually, when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficients of the product are the convolutions of the coefficients of the individual polynomials. But in this case, since we're looking for the coefficient of a specific term \\(a^2b^2\\), which is only present in the first polynomial, and the second polynomial is in terms of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), which are different variables. So, when you multiply, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second part. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product will actually be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems like the coefficient would be a polynomial, but the question is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not considering the \\(c\\) terms. \n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me re-express the problem. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when you expand this, each term will be a product of a term from the first expansion and a term from the second expansion. So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), that term is only present in the first expansion. So, when I multiply it by the second expansion, which is in terms of \\(c\\), the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will be multiplied by every term in the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would actually be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire second expansion. But that would make the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the question is just asking for a numerical coefficient. \n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the question. Perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, treating \\(c\\) as a variable, but the term \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), so its coefficient would be the coefficient in the first part times the entire second part. But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which seems odd. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. But that seems too simple because then the answer would just be 6. \n\nWait, maybe I should think of it differently. Perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), treating \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) as separate variables. So, when you multiply the two expressions, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be present in the first part, and when multiplied by the second part, it will be multiplied by every term in the second part. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would actually be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the entire second expansion. But that would mean the coefficient is a sum of terms involving \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. \n\nWait, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating \\(c\\) as a variable that can be anything, so the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem doesn't specify, so maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me check the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" It just says the coefficient, so perhaps it's considering the entire expression as a polynomial in \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\), and \\(1/c\\), and the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be a term that includes all the factors from the second part. \n\nWait, but that would mean the coefficient is a sum of terms involving \\(c\\). But the problem is likely expecting a numerical coefficient, so perhaps I'm misunderstanding. Alternatively, maybe the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating \\(c\\) as a variable that's being summed over, but I'm not sure. \n\nWait, maybe I should approach it differently. Let me consider that the entire expression is a product of two independent expansions. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) would accumulate all the coefficients from the second expansion. \n\nWait, but that's not quite right either. Let me think again. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion has a coefficient of 6. Then, when you multiply it by the entire second expansion, each term in the second expansion will be multiplied by 6. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the entire second expansion. But that seems like the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\), which isn't a single number. \n\nWait, maybe the problem is just to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and that's it. But that seems too simple, and the second part is there for a reason. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, which would involve considering the second part as well. \n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me try to write out the product. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me denote the first part as \\(P(a, b) = (a + b)^4\\) and the second part as \\(Q(c) = \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the product is \\(P(a, b) \\times Q(c)\\). When you expand this, each term in \\(P(a, b)\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(Q(c)\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(P(a, b)\\) will be multiplied by every term in \\(Q(c)\\). Therefore, in the product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will have a coefficient equal to 6 times the entire expansion of \\(Q(c)\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is \\(6 \\times Q(c)\\). But that seems odd because the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), not a number. \n\nWait, maybe the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating \\(c\\) as a variable, so the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem doesn't specify, so perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Alternatively, maybe the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, considering that \\(c\\) can take any value, but that doesn't make sense either. \n\nWait, perhaps I should consider that the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable, so the coefficient would be a term that includes the coefficients from both parts. But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which seems unlikely because the problem is probably expecting a numerical coefficient. \n\nWait, maybe I'm making this more complicated than it is. Let me think again. The problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, perhaps the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is only present in \\((a + b)^4\\), and when multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the same as in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, which doesn't make sense. \n\nWait, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, the coefficient would be the same as in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) has a coefficient, and when you multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), the total coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second part. \n\nWait, that makes more sense. Because the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\). So, let me compute that. If I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = (2)^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of all coefficients in the second part is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times 64, which is 384. \n\nWait, but I'm not sure if that's correct. Let me think again. If I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = 64\\), which is the sum of all coefficients. So, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by 64, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) becomes 6 times 64, which is 384. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 384. \n\nAlternatively, another way to think about it is that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient in the first part times the sum of all coefficients in the second part because each term in the second part is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). So, that would give 6 times 64, which is 384. \n\nWait, but let me verify this with an example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^1 \\times (c + 1/c)^1 = (a + b)(c + 1/c)\\). The expansion would be \\(ac + a/c + bc + b/c\\). Now, if I look for the coefficient of \\(a^1b^0\\), which is \\(a\\), it would be \\(c + 1/c\\), which is the coefficient from the second part. Similarly, the coefficient of \\(a^0b^1\\) is \\(c + 1/c\\). So, in this case, the coefficient of \\(a\\) is the coefficient from the first part (which is 1) times the sum of coefficients from the second part (which is 2, since \\(c + 1/c\\) evaluated at \\(c=1\\) is 2). So, 1 times 2 is 2, but in reality, the coefficient is \\(c + 1/c\\), which is not a number. So, perhaps my approach is incorrect. \n\nWait, maybe the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating \\(c\\) as a variable, so the coefficient would be a term involving \\(c\\). But the problem doesn't specify, so perhaps I should assume that the coefficient is a numerical value, meaning we need to find the coefficient when \\(c\\) is set to 1. But that might not be the case. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, meaning that the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which would mean the coefficient is a polynomial. But the problem is asking for a coefficient, which is typically a number, so perhaps I'm missing something. \n\nWait, maybe the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating \\(c\\) as a variable, so the coefficient would be a term that includes \\(c\\) terms. But the problem is asking for the coefficient, so perhaps it's expecting an expression in terms of \\(c\\). But the problem didn't specify, so I'm confused. \n\nWait, perhaps I should consider that the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is only present in the first part, and when multiplied by the second part, the coefficient becomes 6 times the entire expansion of the second part. So, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems odd because the problem is asking for a coefficient, which is usually a number, not an expression. \n\nWait, maybe the problem is just to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and that's it. But that seems too simple, and the second part is there for a reason. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, which would involve considering the second part as well. So, perhaps the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which is 64, giving 384. \n\nWait, let me try to think of it as a generating function. If I have two generating functions multiplied together, the coefficient of a specific term in one variable is the product of the coefficient of that term in the first function and the sum of all coefficients in the second function. So, in this case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nSo, as I calculated earlier, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times 64, which is 384. \n\nWait, but let me check that with a smaller example to see if that makes sense. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^1 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). The expansion is \\(ac + a/c + bc + b/c\\). Now, the coefficient of \\(a\\) is \\(c + 1/c\\), which is the same as the sum of coefficients in the second part (which is 2 when \\(c = 1\\)) times the coefficient of \\(a\\) in the first part (which is 1). So, 1 times 2 is 2, but the actual coefficient is \\(c + 1/c\\), which is not 2 unless \\(c = 1\\). So, maybe my approach is only valid when \\(c = 1\\). \n\nWait, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when \\(c\\) is set to 1. So, if I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\), and \\((a + b)^4\\) has the coefficient 6 for \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product when \\(c = 1\\) is 6 times 64, which is 384. But the problem doesn't specify setting \\(c = 1\\), so I'm not sure. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating \\(c\\) as a variable, so the coefficient would be 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that seems like an expression, not a number. \n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try to see what the problem is asking. It says: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, it's a product of two expressions, and we need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion. Since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient would be the same as the coefficient in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which seems odd because the problem is likely expecting a numerical coefficient. \n\nWait, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating \\(c\\) as a variable, so the coefficient would be a term that includes \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient, which is typically a number, so maybe I'm missing something. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, meaning that the coefficient is the same as in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would make the coefficient a polynomial, which doesn't make sense. \n\nWait, maybe the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, considering that \\(c\\) is a variable that can be anything, so the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem is just asking for the coefficient, so perhaps it's expecting an expression in terms of \\(c\\). \n\nWait, but let me think again. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\), and when multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), it becomes \\(6a^2b^2 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(6 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that's an expression, not a number. \n\nWait, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating \\(c\\) as a variable, so the coefficient is \\(6 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But the problem didn't specify, so maybe I'm overcomplicating it. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, considering that \\(c\\) is being multiplied, but that doesn't make sense because \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\). \n\nWait, perhaps I'm making this more complicated than it is. Let me try to think differently. The problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. Since \\(a^2b^2\\) is only in the first part, and the second part is multiplied by it, the coefficient would be the coefficient from the first part times the entire second part. So, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that's an expression, not a number. \n\nWait, but maybe the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when considering all terms, so the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second part. As I calculated earlier, the sum of coefficients in the second part is 64 when \\(c = 1\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times 64, which is 384. \n\nWait, but in the earlier example, when I set \\(c = 1\\), the coefficient of \\(a\\) was \\(c + 1/c\\), which is 2, so 1 times 2 is 2, which is correct. Similarly, in this case, if I set \\(c = 1\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times 64, which is 384. But the problem isn't specifying \\(c = 1\\), so I'm not sure if that's the right approach. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, meaning that the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems odd because the problem is asking for a coefficient, which is usually a number. \n\nWait, maybe I should look at the problem differently. Since \\(a^2b^2\\) is only present in the first part, and the second part is multiplied by it, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the same as the coefficient in the first part times the entire second part.

But the problem is asking for the coefficient, which is typically a number, so perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. \n\nWait, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, so the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems odd because the problem is asking for a coefficient, which is usually a number. \n\nWait, maybe I should consider that the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is only present in the first part, and when multiplied by the second part, the coefficient becomes 6 times the entire expansion of the second part. So, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).

Let me consider that the expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are independent variables, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the same as in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).

    "text": " The problem is asking specifically for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\). \n\nLet me write down the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\). Using the binomial theorem, this would be:\n\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\dbinom{4}{0}a^4b^0 + \\dbinom{4}{1}a^3b^1 + \\dbinom{4}{2}a^2b^2 + \\dbinom{4}{3}a^1b^3 + \\dbinom{4}{4}a^0b^4\n\\]\n\nCalculating the coefficients, I know that \\(\\dbinom{4}{0} = 1\\), \\(\\dbinom{4}{1} = 4\\), \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\), \\(\\dbinom{4}{3} = 4\\), and \\(\\dbinom{4}{4} = 1\\). So, the expansion becomes:\n\n\\[\na^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\n\\]\n\nLooking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I see it's 6. So, in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient is 6. But wait, the original problem is \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, this term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nBut the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). That means I don't need to worry about the \\(c\\) terms when considering the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\). Because when you multiply two expressions together, the coefficient of a specific term in one part doesn't affect the coefficient of another term in the other part. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would just be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, is that right?\n\nWait, no. Actually, when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first polynomial gets multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), that term in the first part is \\(6a^2b^2\\). When I multiply this by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), I'm effectively multiplying \\(6a^2b^2\\) by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nBut the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, in the product, \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). But since the question is only about the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, I think that the coefficient remains 6, because when you multiply \\(6a^2b^2\\) by any term from the second expansion, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term's coefficient in the entire product will be 6 times the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion. Wait, no, that doesn't make sense. Because each term in the second expansion will contribute to different terms in the product, but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient would actually be 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part, but since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, I think that the coefficient is just 6 times the sum of the coefficients of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think again. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), and it's multiplied by each term from the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, that coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. Because each term in the second expansion, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), will contribute to a term that includes \\(a^2b^2\\) times some power of \\(c\\), but the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) across all such terms is 6 times the sum of the coefficients from the second expansion. \n\nWait, but actually, no. Because when you multiply \\(6a^2b^2\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the second expansion will be of the form \\(k c^n\\) where \\(k\\) is a coefficient and \\(n\\) is the exponent. So, when you multiply \\(6a^2b^2\\) by \\(k c^n\\), you get \\(6k a^2b^2 c^n\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the sum of all the coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by 6. \n\nWait, but is that correct? Because each term in the second expansion is being multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) across all terms would indeed be 6 times the sum of the coefficients of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nBut let me check: the sum of the coefficients of a polynomial is found by plugging in 1 for all variables. So, for \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), if I set \\(c = 1\\), I get \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of the coefficients is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nWait, but I'm not sure if that's correct. Let me think again. Because when you have two polynomials multiplied together, the coefficient of a specific term in the first polynomial is multiplied by the entire second polynomial, but when you're looking for the coefficient of a term that only exists in the first polynomial, the second polynomial's entire expansion is multiplied by that coefficient. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would indeed be 6 times the sum of the coefficients of the second polynomial, which is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nBut wait, let me confirm. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Perhaps the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just 6, because the second part doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. Wait, but no, because when you multiply, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm wrong, and the coefficient remains 6 because the second polynomial doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. But that doesn't make sense because when you multiply, you're scaling each term by the entire second polynomial. So, for example, \\(6a^2b^2\\) times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) would give \\(6a^2b^2 \\times\\) (some polynomial in c). So, in the entire product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the sum of the coefficients of the second expansion. \n\nWait, but the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, in the product, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Since the sum of coefficients is 64, as I calculated before, then 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nWait, but maybe I'm confusing something. Let me think differently. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first part, and when multiplied by the second part, each term in the second part will contribute to a different term in the product. However, since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients from the second part, because each term in the second part, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), will add to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times some \\(c\\) term. But when considering the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) irrespective of \\(c\\), it's just 6 times the sum of the coefficients from the second expansion. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Perhaps the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just 6, because the second part doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. But that doesn't seem right because when you multiply, you're scaling each term by the entire second polynomial. \n\nWait, perhaps I should think of it as the product of two polynomials. The first polynomial is \\((a + b)^4\\), and the second is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). When you multiply them, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) from the first is multiplied by each term in the second, which is a polynomial in \\(c\\). So, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^k\\) for various \\(k\\) would be terms like \\(6a^2b^2c^k\\). But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, I think that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients from the second polynomial, because each term in the second polynomial contributes to a term that includes \\(a^2b^2\\). \n\nWait, but in reality, when you multiply \\(6a^2b^2\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), you get \\(6a^2b^2 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial where each term is \\(6a^2b^2\\) times a term from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), because each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is a coefficient times a power of \\(c\\), so when multiplied by \\(6a^2b^2\\), the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) times any power of \\(c\\) is 6 times that coefficient. Therefore, the total coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) across all terms would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). \n\nSo, to find the sum of the coefficients of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), I can substitute \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1/1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the sum of the coefficients is 64. \n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nWait, but I'm not entirely sure. Let me check again. Maybe I should consider that when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in one polynomial is multiplied by each term in the other polynomial, but when you're looking for the coefficient of a specific term that only exists in one of the polynomials, the coefficient is just the product of the coefficients. But in this case, \\(a^2b^2\\) only comes from the first polynomial, so when multiplied by the second polynomial, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is indeed 6 times the sum of the coefficients of the second polynomial. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is simpler. Since the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is only present in the first polynomial, and when you multiply by the second polynomial, each term in the second polynomial is just scaling the \\(a^2b^2\\) term by their coefficients. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the sum of the coefficients of the second polynomial, which is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nWait, but let me think differently. Suppose I consider the entire expansion. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first part, and when multiplied by the second part, it's just \\(6a^2b^2 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, in the entire product, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Maybe the coefficient is just 6, because the second part doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. But that doesn't make sense because when you multiply, each term is scaled by the entire second polynomial. \n\nWait, perhaps I should think of it as the product of two polynomials. The first is a polynomial in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the second is a polynomial in \\(c\\). So, when you multiply them, the coefficients of the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms remain the same, and the coefficients of the \\(c\\) terms are scaled by the coefficients from the second polynomial. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is just 6, because the second polynomial doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) coefficients. \n\nWait, that seems conflicting with my earlier reasoning. So, which is it? Is the coefficient 6 or 384? \n\nLet me try to approach it differently. Let's consider the entire product:\n\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\left(\\text{something in } a \\text{ and } b\\right) \\times \\left(\\text{something in } c\\right)\n\\]\n\nWhen we multiply these, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. So, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) from the first polynomial will be multiplied by each term in the second polynomial, which is a sum of terms like \\(k c^n\\). So, the product will have terms like \\(6k a^2b^2 c^n\\). \n\nNow, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, in the entire product, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the sum of all coefficients from the second polynomial multiplied by 6. Because each term in the second polynomial contributes to a term with \\(a^2b^2\\) and some power of \\(c\\), but the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) across all these terms is 6 times the sum of the coefficients from the second polynomial. \n\nTherefore, the sum of the coefficients from the second polynomial is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nWait, but I'm still a bit confused. Let me think of a simpler example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1)^1\\). The expansion of \\((a + b)^2\\) is \\(a^2 + 2ab + b^2\\). The expansion of \\((c + 1)\\) is \\(c + 1\\). Now, the product is:\n\n\\[\n(a^2 + 2ab + b^2)(c + 1) = a^2c + a^2 + 2abc + 2ab + b^2c + b^2\n\\]\n\nNow, looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\), we have terms \\(a^2c\\) and \\(a^2\\). The coefficients are 1 and 1, so the total coefficient is 1 + 1 = 2. But according to my earlier logic, the coefficient from \\((a + b)^2\\) for \\(a^2\\) is 1, and the sum of coefficients from \\((c + 1)\\) is 2, so 1 * 2 = 2, which matches. \n\nSimilarly, the coefficient of \\(ab\\) would be 2 (from \\(2ab\\)) times the sum of coefficients from \\((c + 1)\\), which is 2, so 2 * 2 = 4. Looking at the product, the terms with \\(ab\\) are \\(2abc\\) and \\(2ab\\), so coefficients are 2 and 2, which sum to 4. \n\nSimilarly, the coefficient of \\(b^2\\) would be 1 * 2 = 2, and in the product, we have \\(b^2c\\) and \\(b^2\\), coefficients 1 and 1, which sum to 2. \n\nSo, in this example, it works: the coefficient of any term in the first polynomial is multiplied by the sum of the coefficients of the second polynomial to get the coefficient in the product. \n\nTherefore, applying this to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 64, so the coefficient in the product is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nWait, but in the example, when I set \\(c = 1\\), I get the sum of coefficients, which is correct. So, yes, that seems to confirm that the approach is correct. \n\nTherefore, I think the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is 384. \n\nBut just to be thorough, let me calculate the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) another way. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) can be written as:\n\n\\[\n\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n\\]\n\nSo, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). The sum of the coefficients is when \\(c = 1\\), so substituting \\(c = 1\\), we get:\n\n\\[\n\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} = 2^6 = 64\n\\]\n\nWhich confirms that the sum of the coefficients is indeed 64. \n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nWait, but I just thought of something else. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). But in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the \\(a^2b^2\\) term is present in the first part, and when multiplied by the second part, it's scaled by each term in the second part. So, in the entire product, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would indeed be 6 times the sum of the coefficients from the second part, which is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nAlternatively, if I consider that the second part is a polynomial in \\(c\\), then when I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, it's just 6 times the entire second polynomial's coefficients summed up, which is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nWait, but another way to think about it is that each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the sum of the coefficients from the second polynomial, because each term in the second polynomial contributes to a term with \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by some power of \\(c\\). So, when you sum all those contributions, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times 64, which is 384. \n\nI think I'm confident now that the coefficient is 384. \n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{384}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem.\n\nFirst, we expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\dbinom{4}{0}a^4 + \\dbinom{4}{1}a^3b + \\dbinom{4}{2}a^2b^2 + \\dbinom{4}{3}ab^3 + \\dbinom{4}{4}b^4\n\\]\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in this expansion is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n\nNext, we consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The sum of the coefficients of this expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\):\n\\[\n\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\n\\]\n\nWhen multiplying \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion.

    "text": " The expression is \\((a + b)^4\\), so I can expand that first. Let me write that out.\n\nFor \\((a + b)^4\\), the expansion would be:\n\n\\[\n\\dbinom{4}{0}a^4b^0 + \\dbinom{4}{1}a^3b^1 + \\dbinom{4}{2}a^2b^2 + \\dbinom{4}{3}a^1b^3 + \\dbinom{4}{4}a^0b^4\n\\]\n\nCalculating the binomial coefficients:\n\n- \\(\\dbinom{4}{0} = 1\\)\n- \\(\\dbinom{4}{1} = 4\\)\n- \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\)\n- \\(\\dbinom{4}{3} = 4\\)\n- \\(\\dbinom{4}{4} = 1\\)\n\nSo, the expansion becomes:\n\n\\[\na^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\n\\]\n\nOkay, so the term with \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(6a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient here is 6. But wait, the original expression isn't just \\((a + b)^4\\); it's multiplied by another expression, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I can't just stop here. I need to consider the entire product.\n\nHmm, so the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I need the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but I also have this other part involving \\(c\\). So, maybe I need to look at both parts separately and then see how they combine.\n\nWait, but \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are variables separate from \\(c\\), right? So, in the product, the variables \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are only present in the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), and the variables \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) are only in the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when I multiply these two expressions together, the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms will multiply with the \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) terms. But since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\), and \\(1/c\\) are all different variables, their exponents won't interfere with each other. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, that doesn't make sense because the entire expansion would include multiple terms, and I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating this.\n\nWait, actually, since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since we're just looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, maybe the coefficient is just 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't seem right because each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) has different powers of \\(c\\), so when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), they would create terms with different \\(c\\) exponents. But since the problem only asks for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) part, maybe we don't need to consider the \\(c\\) terms at all. Wait, but that can't be because the problem includes both parts.\n\nWait, no, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, the problem is asking for the coefficient of the term that has \\(a^2b^2\\), but it doesn't specify anything about the \\(c\\) terms. So, in other words, we're looking for all terms in the product where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2 and 2, respectively, and we don't care about the exponents of \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that can't be right because the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) has multiple terms, each with their own coefficients. So, perhaps the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't sound correct either because each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) has a coefficient, and when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), they would each contribute to the overall coefficient.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think again. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product. Since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are only in the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), and the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), only involves \\(c\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of the second part. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is actually the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because when you multiply \\(6a^2b^2\\) by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each of those terms will have a coefficient, and when you add them all together, you get the total coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) times each possible power of \\(c\\). But since the problem doesn't specify any condition on \\(c\\), we just need the total coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, that would be 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nWait, but how do I find the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)? I think that the sum of all coefficients in a polynomial is found by plugging in 1 for all variables. So, if I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = (2)^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\nWait, but let me check that. So, if I have \\((a + b)^4\\) times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), and I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is 6 in the first part, and the sum of coefficients in the second part is 64, then the total coefficient would be 6*64=384. That seems plausible.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should think of it as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times the entire expansion of the second part, so it's 6 multiplied by each term in the second expansion, so the total coefficient is 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6*64=384.\n\nWait, but let me verify that approach. When you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each polynomial. But in this case, the first polynomial has terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the second has terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second polynomial, you get terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for various \\(k\\). But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, that would mean we're summing all the coefficients of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for any \\(k\\). But in reality, \\(a^2b^2\\) is only present in the first part, and the second part doesn't affect \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would indeed be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the sum of all coefficients in the second part.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, so it's just 6 times the entire expansion's constant term? Wait, no, because the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) doesn't have a constant term unless the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out. Let me check that.\n\nWait, in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - k}(1/c)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, the exponents of \\(c\\) are \\(6 - 2k\\), where \\(k\\) ranges from 0 to 6. So, the constant term occurs when \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which is when \\(k = 3\\). So, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, the sum of all coefficients is when \\(c = 1\\), which is 64, as I calculated earlier. But the constant term is 20.\n\nWait, so if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is 6 in the first part, multiplied by the constant term in the second part, which is 20, then the total coefficient would be 6*20=120. But that contradicts my earlier conclusion of 384. Hmm, so which one is correct?\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in interpreting the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, each term in the product would be of the form \\(6a^2b^2 \\times \\text{(term from second expansion)}\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be \\(6\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, because each term in the second expansion is a coefficient times some power of \\(c\\), and when you multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), you get \\(a^2b^2\\) times each coefficient times \\(c^k\\). But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, that would mean we're summing all the coefficients from the second expansion, each multiplied by 6, so the total coefficient is 6 times 64, which is 384.\n\nBut wait, another way to think about it is that the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is present only once in the first expansion, and when multiplied by each term in the second expansion, it creates multiple terms in the product, each with \\(a^2b^2\\) and different powers of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is indeed 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6*64=384.\n\nBut earlier, I thought that maybe only the constant term would contribute, but that's not the case because the problem doesn't specify any condition on \\(c\\). So, even if \\(c\\) has an exponent, as long as the term has \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) part, it's included. Therefore, the coefficient is 384.\n\nWait, but let me check this with a simpler example to make sure. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^1 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, expanding, it's \\((a + b)(c + 1/c)\\). The coefficient of \\(a^1b^0\\) would be 1 times the sum of coefficients in the second part, which is 1 + 1 = 2, so 1*2=2. But if I actually expand it, the terms are \\(ac + a/c + bc + b/c\\). The coefficient of \\(a\\) is 1 for \\(ac\\) and 1 for \\(a/c\\), so total coefficient is 2, which matches. Similarly, the coefficient of \\(b\\) is 1 for \\(bc\\) and 1 for \\(b/c\\), so total coefficient is 2. So, that seems to work.\n\nSimilarly, if I take \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^2\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^0\\) would be \\(\\dbinom{2}{2}=1\\) times the sum of coefficients in the second expansion, which is (1 + 1)^2=4, so total coefficient is 1*4=4. Expanding, the terms involving \\(a^2\\) would be \\(a^2c^2\\) and \\(a^2/c^2\\), each with coefficient 1, so total coefficient is 2, which doesn't match. Wait, that contradicts my earlier conclusion.\n\nWait, no, hold on. Wait, in \\((a + b)^2\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) is 1, and in \\((c + 1/c)^2\\), the expansion is \\(c^2 + 2 + 1/c^2\\). So, the sum of coefficients is 1 + 2 + 1 = 4. So, 1*4=4. But when I multiply, the terms with \\(a^2\\) are \\(a^2c^2\\), \\(a^2*2\\), and \\(a^2*1/c^2\\). So, the coefficients are 1, 2, and 1, adding up to 4. So, that does match. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) in the product is indeed 4, which is 1 times 4. So, that works.\n\nWait, but in my earlier example, I thought the coefficient was 2, but actually, it's 4 because each term in the second expansion contributes to the coefficient when multiplied by \\(a^2\\). So, that seems to confirm that the approach is correct.\n\nTherefore, going back to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). The sum of coefficients in the second expansion is found by setting \\(c=1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me double-check that. If I set \\(c=1\\), then \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = (1 + 1)^6 = 64\\), which is correct. So, the sum of all coefficients is 64, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6*64=384.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can think of it as the entire product being the product of two independent expansions, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which is 6*64=384.\n\nWait, but another approach: maybe I can consider the entire product and think about how the terms interact. Let me think: each term in the product is a term from \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by a term from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second part, each of which has a coefficient. So, when you collect all the terms that have \\(a^2b^2\\), their coefficients will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times each coefficient from the second part. So, the total coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which is 6*64=384.\n\nTherefore, I think that's the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{384}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem for both parts of the expression.\n\nFirst, we expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n\\]\nThe term with \\(a^2b^2\\) is:\n\\[\n\\dbinom{4}{2}a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\n\\]\nSo, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\nNext, we consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The sum of all coefficients in this expansion can be found by setting \\(c = 1\\):\n\\[\n\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\n\\]\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):\n\\[\n6 \\times 64 = 384\n\\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{384}\\)."

    "text": " \n\nLet me start by looking at the first part of the expression, which is \\((a + b)^4\\). I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in this part. So, using the binomial theorem, the general term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\\). I need the term where \\(a^2b^2\\), which means I need \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). So, plugging in \\(k = 2\\), the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). \n\nCalculating that, \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) is \\(\\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6. \n\nNow, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part will be multiplied by every term in the expansion of the second part. But wait, I think the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the other variables. So, does that mean I don't need to worry about the \\(c\\) terms? Or maybe, since \\(a^2b^2\\) is only from the first part, the coefficient would just be 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. \n\nWait, no, that doesn't make sense. Because when you multiply two expressions together, each term in the first expression is multiplied by each term in the second expression. So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which only comes from the first part, then I need to consider how it interacts with the second part. But since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term without \\(c\\), does that mean it's multiplied by the constant term (if any) in the second expression? Or maybe the second expression doesn't affect the \\(a^2b^2\\) term? \n\nWait, no, actually, when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second, and the variables are combined. So, if I have \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part, and I multiply it by any term from the second part, which has \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), the resulting term will have \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by some power of \\(c\\). But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not considering the \\(c\\) terms. Hmm, that's a bit confusing. \n\nWait, maybe I misinterpret the problem. It says, \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, perhaps it's considering the entire expression as a single polynomial, and we need the coefficient of the term that has \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). But that seems a bit tricky because \\(a^2b^2\\) can be multiplied by different powers of \\(c\\), each contributing a different term. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, so we need the coefficient for all terms where the variables are \\(a^2b^2\\) and any power of \\(c\\). But that seems like it would involve multiple terms, each with different coefficients. \n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me re-read the problem: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, the problem is asking for the coefficient of the term \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. That is, we're looking for all terms in the expansion where the variables \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are squared, and we sum up their coefficients, treating the \\(c\\) terms as separate variables. \n\nWait, no, that might not be right either. Alternatively, perhaps the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is considered in the product, and since the other part involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would result in a polynomial where each term is \\(6 \\times\\) a term from the second expansion, multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). So, if that's the case, then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which doesn't make sense because the coefficient should be a number, not a polynomial. \n\nHmm, maybe I'm approaching this wrong. Let me think again. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can consider the entire expression as a product of two polynomials. So, when we expand this product, each term will be of the form \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}a^{4 - k}b^k \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - m}\\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). \n\nSimplifying the \\(c\\) terms: \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - m}c^{-m} = \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, each term in the product will be \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}\\dbinom{6}{m}a^{4 - k}b^k c^{6 - 2m}\\). \n\nNow, we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, we need \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). So, \\(k = 2\\), and the coefficient from the first part is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). \n\nNow, for each \\(m\\), the term will have \\(a^2b^2c^{6 - 2m}\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). Wait, that can't be, because each term has a different power of \\(c\\). So, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, considering all possible powers of \\(c\\). But that would mean that the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. \n\nWait, perhaps I misread the problem. Maybe it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) can be multiplied by any power of \\(c\\), but we just need the coefficient for each such term. But that seems like it would be multiple coefficients, each corresponding to a different power of \\(c\\). \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, meaning we're summing over all possible \\(c\\) exponents. But that would mean adding up all the coefficients from the second expansion, multiplied by 6. \n\nWait, but that would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The sum of coefficients in a polynomial is found by setting all variables to 1. So, setting \\(c = 1\\), \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of coefficients is 64. Therefore, 6 times 64 would be 384. But that seems too high, and I'm not sure if that's the correct approach. \n\nWait, no, maybe not. Because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a specific term in the product. So, perhaps each term in the product is \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by a term from the second expansion. So, the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by each coefficient from the second expansion, but we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would be 6 times the entire expansion of the second part. But that can't be right because the coefficient should be a single number, not a polynomial. \n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think differently. Maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, that would mean that \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term that's present in the product, and its coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of the second part. But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, which doesn't make sense. \n\nWait, perhaps the problem is only considering the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) variables and ignoring the \\(c\\) variables, so we're treating \\(c\\) as a separate entity. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which seems odd. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, considering all possible terms, so the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. As I thought earlier, the sum of coefficients in the second expansion is when \\(c = 1\\), which is \\(2^6 = 64\\). So, 6 times 64 is 384. But I'm not sure if that's the right approach. \n\nWait, let me try to think of it differently. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when you expand this, each term will be a product of a term from the first expansion and a term from the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the first expansion, specifically from the term \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}a^2b^2\\). Now, when this term is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, which is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\), the resulting term is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\dbinom{6}{m}a^2b^2c^{6 - 2m}\\). \n\nSo, in the entire product, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^{6 - 2m}\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\dbinom{6}{m}\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). That is, it's asking for all terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present, regardless of the \\(c\\) exponent. So, that would mean that the coefficient is the sum over all \\(m\\) of \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\dbinom{6}{m}\\). \n\nBut wait, that would be 6 times the sum of \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\) for \\(m = 0\\) to \\(6\\). The sum of \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\) from \\(m = 0\\) to \\(6\\) is \\(2^6 = 64\\). So, 6 times 64 is 384. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 384. \n\nWait, but that seems too large. Let me check my reasoning again. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, considering only the terms where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out, i.e., \\(c^0\\). So, in that case, we would need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be zero. From the second expansion, the exponent is \\(6 - 2m\\), so setting \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), we get \\(m = 3\\). \n\nSo, the term where \\(m = 3\\) in the second expansion is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}c^{0} = 20\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} \\times \\dbinom{6}{3} = 6 \\times 20 = 120\\). \n\nWait, that makes more sense. So, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, considering only the terms where the \\(c\\) exponents cancel out, i.e., the constant term in the second expansion. \n\nBut the problem statement didn't specify anything about \\(c\\), so I'm not sure. Let me read the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" It doesn't mention anything about \\(c\\), so maybe it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, meaning that the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\). But that seems odd because coefficients are usually constants. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, so the coefficient would include all the terms from the second expansion. But that would make the coefficient a polynomial, which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. \n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so in the product, each term is a product of a term from the first expansion and a term from the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term from the second expansion, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^{6 - 2m}\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\dbinom{6}{m}\\). \n\nBut the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. That is, it's asking for the sum of all coefficients where the term has \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) exponent. So, that would be the sum over all \\(m\\) of \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\dbinom{6}{m}\\), which is 6 times the sum of \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\) from \\(m=0\\) to \\(6\\), which is 6 times 64, which is 384. \n\nBut I'm not sure if that's what the problem is asking for. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, considering all possible \\(c\\) terms. But that would mean that the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which seems unlikely because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. \n\nWait, perhaps the problem is only concerned with the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) variables, and the \\(c\\) terms are just part of the expression, but we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable. So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which would be a polynomial in \\(c\\). But that seems complicated, and I'm not sure if that's what the problem wants. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, meaning that we're considering \\(a^2b^2\\) as a standalone term, and its coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of the second part. But that would make the coefficient a polynomial, which doesn't make sense. \n\nWait, perhaps I'm misinterpreting the problem. Maybe it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, meaning that we need to find all terms in the product that have exactly \\(a^2b^2\\) and any power of \\(c\\), and then sum their coefficients. But that would be the same as 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 times 64, which is 384. \n\nBut I'm not entirely confident. Let me try to think of it differently. Suppose I set \\(c = 1\\). Then the entire expression becomes \\((a + b)^4 \\times (1 + 1)^6 = (a + b)^4 \\times 64\\). In this case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 64 times the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6. So, 64 times 6 is 384. \n\nAlternatively, if I set \\(c = 1\\), I'm effectively summing all the coefficients in the second expansion, which gives me the total coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) across all powers of \\(c\\). So, that seems to support the idea that the coefficient is 384. \n\nBut I'm still not sure if that's what the problem is asking for. Let me check the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" It doesn't specify anything about \\(c\\), so perhaps the answer is 384. \n\nWait, but I'm not sure. Another way to think about it is that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of the second part, which is a polynomial. But since the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, that can't be right. \n\nWait, perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and the second part is irrelevant. But that seems unlikely because the problem includes both parts in the expression. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, considering all possible \\(c\\) terms, so the coefficient would be a polynomial, but the problem is asking for the coefficient as a number, so perhaps it's the sum of all coefficients when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). \n\nWait, I think I'm going in circles here. Let me try to approach it differently. The problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nSo, when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum of the products of the coefficients of terms whose variables multiply to give the desired term. In this case, the desired term is \\(a^2b^2\\). \n\nSo, in the first polynomial, \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, as I calculated earlier. \n\nIn the second polynomial, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - m}\\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\). \n\nNow, when we multiply the two polynomials together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first polynomial will be multiplied by each term in the second polynomial, resulting in terms like \\(6 \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}a^2b^2c^{6 - 2m}\\). \n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^{6 - 2m}\\) is \\(6 \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}\\). \n\nBut the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). That is, it's asking for all terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present, regardless of the \\(c\\) exponent. So, that would mean that the coefficient is the sum over all \\(m\\) of \\(6 \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}\\). \n\nCalculating that sum: \\(6 \\times \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m}\\). \n\nWe know that \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} = 2^6 = 64\\). \n\nSo, the total coefficient would be \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). \n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 384. \n\nWait, but I'm not entirely sure if that's the correct interpretation. Because the problem didn't specify anything about \\(c\\), but if we consider that \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term on its own, regardless of \\(c\\), then perhaps the coefficient is 384. \n\nAlternatively, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, considering only the terms where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out, i.e., \\(c^0\\), then we would set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which gives \\(m = 3\\). \n\nIn that case, the coefficient would be \\(6 \\times \\dbinom{6}{3} = 6 \\times 20 = 120\\). \n\nBut the problem didn't specify anything about \\(c\\), so I'm not sure which interpretation is correct. \n\nWait, perhaps the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, so the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\). But that doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is only concerned with the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) variables, and the \\(c\\) terms are just part of the expression, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the entire expansion of the second part. But that would make the coefficient a polynomial, which doesn't make sense. \n\nI think the most reasonable interpretation is that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, that would mean summing over all possible \\(c\\) exponents, giving us 384. \n\nBut I'm still a bit unsure. Let me check with an example. Suppose I have a simpler case: \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^0\\) would be \\(\\dbinom{2}{2} \\times \\dbinom{1}{0} + \\dbinom{2}{2} \\times \\dbinom{1}{1}\\). Wait, no, actually, in this case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^0\\) would be \\(\\dbinom{2}{2} \\times \\dbinom{1}{0}c^1 + \\dbinom{2}{2} \\times \\dbinom{1}{1}c^{-1}\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{2}{2} \\times (\\dbinom{1}{0}c^1 + \\dbinom{1}{1}c^{-1}) = 1 \\times (c + 1/c)\\). \n\nBut if the problem had asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^0\\), it would be \\(c + 1/c\\), which is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But if the problem had asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^0\\) when \\(c = 1\\), then it would be 2. \n\nIn our original problem, since the problem didn't specify anything about \\(c\\), perhaps the coefficient is a polynomial, but the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, which suggests that maybe I'm supposed to consider only the constant term in the second expansion. \n\nWait, but the problem didn't specify that. So, perhaps the correct approach is to consider that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the entire expansion of the second part, which would be a polynomial. But that seems unlikely because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, meaning that the coefficient is a polynomial, but the problem is phrased incorrectly. \n\nWait, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\). In that case, we need to find the coefficient where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which gives \\(m = 3\\). \n\nSo, in that case, the coefficient would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} \\times \\dbinom{6}{3} = 6 \\times 20 = 120\\). \n\nThat seems more plausible because it gives a numerical coefficient. So, perhaps the problem is implicitly asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be 120. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of \\(c\\), which would be 384. \n\nBut since the problem didn't specify anything about \\(c\\), I'm not sure. \n\nWait, perhaps the problem is written as \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), and we're to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable. So, the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\), but the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, which suggests that perhaps I'm supposed to consider only the constant term in the second expansion. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is only concerned with the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) variables, and the \\(c\\) terms are just part of the expression, but we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would be 6 times the entire expansion of the second part. \n\nBut I'm not sure. Let me try to see if there's another approach. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, considering all possible \\(c\\) terms, so the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, so that can't be. \n\nWait, perhaps the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating \\(c\\) as a constant. So, the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But that seems odd because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is only interested in the term \\(a^2b^2\\) and the constant term in \\(c\\), i.e., \\(c^0\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\), which is 6 times 20, which is 120. \n\nI think that's the most plausible interpretation. Because if the problem had wanted the coefficient regardless of \\(c\\), it would have specified that, or perhaps it's implicitly considering \\(c\\) as a constant. \n\nSo, to sum up, I think the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 120, considering only the constant term in the second expansion. \n\nWait, but earlier I thought that the sum over all \\(m\\) would give 384, but that seems too high. \n\nWait, let me think again. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. So, in the product, each term is a product of a term from the first expansion and a term from the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term from the second expansion, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^{6 - 2m}\\). \n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^{6 - 2m}\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\dbinom{6}{m}\\). \n\nIf the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), then we're looking for the sum over all \\(m\\) of \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\dbinom{6}{m}\\), which is 6 times 64, which is 384. \n\nBut if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it's 6 times \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\), which is 120. \n\nSince the problem didn't specify anything about \\(c\\), I think the correct interpretation is that it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which would be 384. \n\nBut I'm still not entirely sure. Let me check with a simpler example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^1 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). The expansion is \\(a \\times c + a \\times 1/c + b \\times c + b \\times 1/c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a\\) is \\(c + 1/c\\), which is a polynomial. Similarly, the coefficient of \\(b\\) is \\(c + 1/c\\). \n\nIf the problem had asked for the coefficient of \\(a\\) in this product, the answer would be \\(c + 1/c\\), which is a polynomial. But if the problem had asked for the coefficient of \\(a\\) when \\(c = 1\\), it would be 2. \n\nIn our original problem, since the problem didn't specify anything about \\(c\\), I think the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which would be 6 times the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that seems odd because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable, so the coefficient is a polynomial, but the problem is phrased incorrectly. \n\nWait, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\). In that case, the coefficient would be 120. \n\nGiven that the problem didn't specify anything about \\(c\\), I'm going to assume that it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be 120. \n\nWait, but I'm still not entirely confident. Let me think again. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. If \\(c\\) is another variable, then the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\), but that's not a numerical coefficient. So, perhaps the problem is only interested in the numerical coefficient, assuming that \\(c\\) is set to 1. \n\nIf I set \\(c = 1\\), then the second part becomes \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product when \\(c = 1\\) is 6 times 64, which is 384. \n\nAlternatively, if \\(c\\) is not set to 1, then the coefficient is a polynomial. But since the problem didn't specify, I think the intended answer is 120, considering only the constant term in \\(c\\). \n\nWait, but I'm not sure. Maybe I should look for another approach. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use generating functions. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the product of the coefficients of \\(a^2b^2\\) in each part. But that's not correct because the product involves multiplying each term from the first expansion by each term from the second. \n\nWait, no, that's not the case. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the sum over all terms where the product of the terms from each expansion results in \\(a^2b^2\\). But since the second expansion only involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), it doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion, which is 6, multiplied by the entire second expansion. \n\nWait, that can't be right because then the coefficient would be a polynomial, which doesn't make sense. \n\nWait, perhaps I'm making a mistake here. Let me think carefully. \n\nThe product \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) can be seen as the product of two polynomials: one in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the other in \\(c\\). So, when you multiply them, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. \n\nSo, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^{6 - 2m}\\). \n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^{6 - 2m}\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\dbinom{6}{m}\\). \n\nIf the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then we need to sum over all \\(m\\) the coefficients \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\dbinom{6}{m}\\). \n\nSo, that would be \\(6 \\times \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} = 6 \\times 64 = 384\\). \n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 384. \n\nI think that's the correct answer. Even though the problem didn't specify anything about \\(c\\), I think the intended interpretation is that we're considering all possible powers of \\(c\\), so the coefficient is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is found by expanding each part separately and then combining the results. \n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\):**  \n   Using the binomial theorem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n\n2. **Consider the entire expression:**  \n   The term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\n3. **Sum the coefficients:**  \n   The sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(2^6 = 64\\).

Using the binomial theorem, I can expand this as:\n\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\dbinom{4}{0}a^4b^0 + \\dbinom{4}{1}a^3b^1 + \\dbinom{4}{2}a^2b^2 + \\dbinom{4}{3}a^1b^3 + \\dbinom{4}{4}a^0b^4\n\\]\n\nCalculating the binomial coefficients:\n\n- \\(\\dbinom{4}{0} = 1\\)\n- \\(\\dbinom{4}{1} = 4\\)\n- \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\)\n- \\(\\dbinom{4}{3} = 4\\)\n- \\(\\dbinom{4}{4} = 1\\)\n\nSo, expanding, we get:\n\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\n\\]\n\nOkay, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in this part is 6. But wait, the problem isn't just \\((a + b)^4\\); it's multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).

So, does that mean that \\(a^2b^2\\) is only present in the first part, and when multiplied by the second part, which only has \\(c\\) terms, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will just be multiplied by each term in the second expansion?\n\nWait, no. Let me think again. Actually, the expression is a product of two polynomials: one in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and another in \\(c\\). Since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are different variables, their exponents won't interfere with each other. So, when we multiply these two expansions, the terms will be products of terms from each expansion. \n\nBut the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, in the product, any term that has \\(a^2b^2\\) must come from multiplying the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in \\((a + b)^4\\) by any term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, the \\(c\\) terms don't have any \\(a\\) or \\(b\\) in them, so when we multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, we'll get terms like \\(a^2b^2c^{6 - 2m}\\), right?\n\nBut the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not \\(a^2b^2c^{something}\\). Hmm, so maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Wait, perhaps the original expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), and we need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, treating \\(c\\) as another variable. But that would mean that the term \\(a^2b^2\\) could be multiplied by any power of \\(c\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually be the sum of all the coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part.\n\nWait, but no. Because in the product, each term is a product of terms from each polynomial. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would actually be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire second polynomial, because when you multiply by each term in the second polynomial, you get \\(a^2b^2\\) times each term in the second polynomial. But wait, that would mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all coefficients in the second part.\n\nWait, no, that's not quite right. Let me clarify. When you have two polynomials multiplied together, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum of the products of the coefficients of terms whose variables multiply to give that specific term. But in this case, since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are only in the first polynomial, and \\(c\\) is only in the second, the variables are separate. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be present in each term where you take \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first polynomial and multiply it by any term from the second polynomial. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial.\n\nWait, is that correct? Let me think. Suppose I have \\(P(a, b) \\times Q(c)\\), where \\(P(a, b)\\) is a polynomial in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and \\(Q(c)\\) is a polynomial in \\(c\\). Then, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\(P(a, b) \\times Q(c)\\) would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(P(a, b)\\) multiplied by the entire polynomial \\(Q(c)\\). But when we talk about the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, we're considering the product as a polynomial in all variables \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) can be multiplied by any power of \\(c\\), so the coefficient would actually be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(P(a, b)\\) times the sum of the coefficients of all terms in \\(Q(c)\\). \n\nBut wait, no. Because in the product, each term is a product of a term from \\(P(a, b)\\) and a term from \\(Q(c)\\). So, if we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then the coefficient would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(P(a, b)\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(Q(c)\\). Because for each term in \\(Q(c)\\), when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), it contributes to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^{...}\\), but if we're just looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without considering \\(c\\), then maybe we need to consider the entire sum.\n\nWait, but in reality, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is just one term, and when multiplied by \\(Q(c)\\), it becomes \\(a^2b^2 \\times Q(c)\\), which is \\(a^2b^2\\) times a sum of terms with different powers of \\(c\\). So, in the entire product, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually be the coefficient from \\(P(a, b)\\) times the entire \\(Q(c)\\), but that doesn't make sense because \\(Q(c)\\) is a polynomial in \\(c\\), not a scalar.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think differently. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in the entire expansion, any term that has \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by any power of \\(c\\) would contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is actually the coefficient from the first part, 6, multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nWait, but no, that's not quite right either. Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second polynomial, you get terms like \\(a^2b^2c^{6 - 2m}\\), each with their own coefficients. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would actually be the sum of the coefficients of each of these terms. But since \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial times the sum of the coefficients of all terms in the second polynomial.\n\nWait, but the sum of the coefficients in the second polynomial is found by setting \\(c = 1\\). So, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) evaluated at \\(c = 1\\) is \\((1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of the coefficients in the second polynomial is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 (from the first part) times 64 (sum of coefficients in the second part), which is 384.\n\nWait, but let me make sure that's correct. So, in the product, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nBut wait, let me think again. Because in the product, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part, which are terms like \\(c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, in the product, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^{6 - 2m}\\) would be 6 * \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\). But if we're just looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then we need to sum over all m the coefficients of \\(a^2b^2c^{6 - 2m}\\), which would be 6 * \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m}\\). But \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} = 2^6 = 64\\), so indeed, 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but that seems high. Let me check with a smaller example to see if this approach is correct. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, expanding, \\((a + b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2\\), and \\((c + 1/c)^1 = c + 1/c\\). So, the product is \\(a^2(c + 1/c) + 2ab(c + 1/c) + b^2(c + 1/c)\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) would be 1 (from \\(a^2\\)) times (1 + 1) = 2. Similarly, the coefficient of \\(ab\\) would be 2 times (1 + 1) = 4, and the coefficient of \\(b^2\\) would be 1 times (1 + 1) = 2. So, in this case, the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) is indeed 2, which is 1 (coefficient in first part) times 2 (sum of coefficients in second part). So, this seems to confirm that the approach is correct.\n\nTherefore, applying this to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 6 (from \\((a + b)^4\\)) times 64 (sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\)), which equals 384.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the binomial expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). The sum of the coefficients is indeed found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, that part is correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of it as the product of two polynomials, and the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the coefficient from the first polynomial times the entire second polynomial, but that seems a bit abstract. However, since the variables are separate, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is just the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me check another way. Let's consider that in the product, each term is a product of a term from each polynomial. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from taking \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first polynomial and multiplying it by any term from the second polynomial. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is indeed the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nSo, I think that's the correct approach. Therefore, the coefficient is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is found by expanding each part separately and then multiplying the relevant coefficients. \n\n1. Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is 6.\n2. The second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), has a sum of coefficients equal to \\(2^6 = 64\\) when \\(c = 1\\).\n3. Multiply the two coefficients: \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\boxed{384}."

    "text": " \n\nLet me write down what \\((a + b)^4\\) would expand to. Using the binomial theorem, that would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{0}a^4b^0 + \\dbinom{4}{1}a^3b^1 + \\dbinom{4}{2}a^2b^2 + \\dbinom{4}{3}a^1b^3 + \\dbinom{4}{4}a^0b^4\\). Simplifying the coefficients, that's \\(1 \\cdot a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + 1b^4\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. \n\nBut wait, the problem isn't just \\((a + b)^4\\); it's multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I need to consider the entire expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Hmm, but the question is about the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). That term doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), right? So, does that mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just 6, regardless of the other part? Or do I need to consider how the other part might affect it? \n\nWait, no, I think I'm missing something. Because the entire expression is a product of two expansions, so when you multiply them, the terms can combine in different ways. But the term \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), so when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by any term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), it will just be \\(a^2b^2\\) times some coefficient and some power of \\(c\\). But since the question is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, I think I need to sum all the coefficients from the second expansion that, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), result in a term that still has \\(a^2b^2\\). \n\nWait, no, that might not make sense because \\(a^2b^2\\) is part of the first expansion, and the second expansion is in terms of \\(c\\). So, when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by any term from the second expansion, you'll get terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2c^{-k}\\), but the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) itself, without any \\(c\\) terms, would only come from multiplying \\(a^2b^2\\) by the constant term in the second expansion. \n\nAh, so I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because if I multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by the constant term, that's the only way to get a term that's just \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\) factors. All other terms would have some power of \\(c\\), so they wouldn't contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). \n\nSo, let me find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Again, using the binomial theorem, this expansion is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k\\). Simplifying that, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} c^{-k} = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). \n\nWe want the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, because that's the constant term. So, set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(6 = 2k\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\), which is 20. \n\nSo, the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Therefore, when I multiply the two expansions, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the constant term in the second expansion is 20. So, the overall coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). \n\nWait, let me double-check that. So, \\((a + b)^4\\) gives 6 for \\(a^2b^2\\), and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) has a constant term of 20. So, when you multiply these two, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) gets multiplied by 20, so the coefficient becomes 6 * 20 = 120. That seems right. \n\nAlternatively, if I think about the entire product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) can only come from multiplying \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part by the constant term from the second part, because any other term from the second part would introduce a \\(c\\) term, which would make the term \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or similar, which isn't \\(a^2b^2\\). So, yes, only the constant term from the second expansion affects the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120. I think that's the answer. \n\nWait, just to make sure I didn't make a mistake in calculating the constant term. Let me compute \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\) again. 6 choose 3 is (6*5*4)/(3*2*1) = 20. Yep, that's correct. And in the first expansion, 4 choose 2 is 6. So, 6 * 20 is indeed 120. \n\nI think that's solid. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Multiplying these together gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\boxed{120}"

    "text": " \n\nAlright, let's start with the first part, which is \\((a + b)^4\\). I need to find the term that has \\(a^2b^2\\). Using the binomial theorem, each term in the expansion is \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\\). So, I need the term where \\(a\\) is squared and \\(b\\) is squared. That would mean \\(4 - k = 2\\) for \\(a\\), so \\(k = 2\\). Therefore, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\).\n\nLet me compute that. \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) is calculated as \\(\\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient from the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), is 6.\n\nNow, the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). That means I don't need to consider the \\(c\\) terms when looking for \\(a^2b^2\\), right? Because \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\). So, does that mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just the same as in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, regardless of the other part? Hmm, maybe. Let me think again.\n\nWait, no, that can't be right. Because the entire expression is the product of \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when you multiply them, each term in the first expansion gets multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), that means we only need the term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) that has \\(c^0\\), because \\(a^2b^2\\) is just a constant with respect to \\(c\\). So, in other words, the term that doesn't have any \\(c\\) in it.\n\nWait, but is that correct? Let me make sure. If I have \\((a + b)^4\\) times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), and I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), then I need to consider all terms in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) and multiply them by the corresponding terms in \\((a + b)^4\\). But since \\(a^2b^2\\) is independent of \\(c\\), the only way it will appear in the product is if we take the term from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) that is a constant term (i.e., \\(c^0\\)) and multiply it by the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from \\((a + b)^4\\). So, yes, that makes sense. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\).\n\nSo, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Let me apply the binomial theorem again here. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(1/c\\right)^m\\). Simplifying each term, that becomes \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the exponent of \\(c\\) in each term is \\(6 - 2m\\). We want the term where the exponent is 0, so we set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\).\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). Wait, that doesn't seem right.

It says, \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, they're treating \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) as independent variables, and they just want the coefficient of the term where \\(a\\) is squared and \\(b\\) is squared, regardless of the power of \\(c\\). \n\nSo, in other words, when you expand the entire expression, you'll have terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2c^{-k}\\) for various \\(k\\), and the coefficient would be the sum of all the coefficients from those terms. But wait, that's not exactly right either because the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually be a polynomial in \\(c\\). So, perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable, so the coefficient would be 6 times the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nBut that seems too broad because the question is likely expecting a numerical coefficient. Wait, maybe I'm misinterpreting the problem. Perhaps it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when considering the entire expression, but \\(c\\) is being treated as a separate variable, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is expecting me to consider the coefficient as a single number, but that doesn't make sense because the expression involves \\(c\\). Wait, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where \\(c\\) is raised to the zero power. That would make sense because then the coefficient would be a single number. \n\nLet me check that interpretation. So, if we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), that would be the term where \\(a\\) is squared, \\(b\\) is squared, and \\(c\\) is to the zero power. So, in that case, the coefficient would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nThat seems plausible. So, first, I can compute the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6 as I found earlier. Then, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), I can use the binomial theorem again. The expansion is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - k}\\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\\). \n\nWe need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be 0, so we set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\), which is 20. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the second part), which is 120. \n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6a\u00b2b\u00b2, and in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term with \\(c^0\\) is 20. So, when I multiply these together, I get 6 * 20 a\u00b2b\u00b2, which is 120a\u00b2b\u00b2. So, the coefficient is indeed 120. \n\nAlternatively, if the problem was just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without considering \\(c\\), then it would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but that would result in a polynomial in \\(c\\), not a single number. So, I think the correct interpretation is that we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. \n\nLet me double-check my calculations. \n\nFirst part: \\((a + b)^4\\). The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). That's correct. \n\nSecond part: \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). The term with \\(c^0\\) is when the exponent is zero, so solving \\(6 - 2k = 0\\) gives \\(k = 3\\). The coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). That's correct too. \n\nMultiplying them together: 6 * 20 = 120. So, the coefficient is 120. \n\nI think that makes sense. So, the final answer should be 120. \n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me think if there's another way to approach this problem. Maybe expanding both parts separately and then multiplying, but that seems more complicated. Alternatively, perhaps using multinomial coefficients, but I think the binomial approach is sufficient here. \n\nAnother way to check is to consider specific values. For example, if I set \\(a = 1\\), \\(b = 1\\), and \\(c = 1\\), then the original expression becomes \\((1 + 1)^4 \\times (1 + 1)^6 = 16 \\times 64 = 1024\\). The term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 1^2 * 1^2 = 1, and its coefficient would be 120, so 120 * (c terms evaluated at c=1) would be 120 * 64 = 7680, but that doesn't match 1024, so maybe that approach isn't helpful. \n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Alternatively, maybe I should consider that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, not a single number. So, perhaps the problem is expecting me to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), which would be 6 times the entire expansion, but that seems unlikely because the problem is asking for a coefficient, implying a single number. \n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in interpreting the problem. Maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, so the coefficient would be 6 times the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't seem right because the problem is likely expecting a numerical coefficient. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), as I thought earlier, which is 120. \n\nWait, perhaps the problem is written as \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), and it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which would be 6*(c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15/c^2 + 6/c^4 + 1/c^6). But that seems too long, and the problem is likely expecting a single number. \n\nWait, maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable, so the coefficient is 6 times the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but that would result in a polynomial, not a single number. So, perhaps the problem is miswritten, or I'm misinterpreting it. \n\nWait, alternatively, maybe the problem is written as \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), and it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), meaning that we're supposed to treat \\(c\\) as a variable that could affect the coefficient. But that doesn't make sense because \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are independent variables, so their coefficients are independent as well. \n\nWait, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, which would include all possible powers of \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But that seems odd because the problem is asking for a coefficient, which is usually a number. \n\nWait, maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when the entire expression is expanded, but considering that \\(c\\) could be any variable, perhaps we're supposed to find the coefficient as a polynomial in \\(c\\). But that seems more complicated, and the problem doesn't specify that. \n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it, and the problem is simply expecting me to recognize that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and since it's multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the coefficient remains 6, but that seems too simplistic. \n\nWait, no, that can't be right because when you multiply by the entire expansion, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which would make the coefficient a polynomial in \\(c\\). \n\nBut the problem is asking for the coefficient, which is usually a scalar, so perhaps the problem is expecting me to find the constant term in the coefficient, i.e., the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be 6 * 20 = 120, as I thought earlier. \n\nYes, that makes sense. So, I think the correct approach is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. \n\nSo, to summarize my steps:\n\n1. Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is 6.\n\n2. Expand \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem and find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\), which is 20.\n\n3. Multiply the two coefficients together: 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120.\n\nWait, just to make sure, let me write out the expansions more explicitly.\n\nFirst, \\((a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6.\n\nNext, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - k}(1/c)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\\).\n\nWe need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\) \u2192 \\(k = 3\\). The coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n\nTherefore, the term is \\(20c^0 = 20\\).\n\nSo, when we multiply the two expansions, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by the term \\(20\\) from the second part, resulting in \\(6 * 20 a^2b^2 = 120a^2b^2\\).\n\nThus, the coefficient is 120.\n\nI think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning now.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then finding the constant term (coefficient of \\(c^0\\)) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20. Multiplying these together gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

    "text": " \n\nAlright, so starting with \\((a + b)^4\\). Using the binomial theorem, the expansion will be \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\\). I need the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, let's see, when \\(a^{4 - k}b^k\\) becomes \\(a^2b^2\\), that means \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). So, the coefficient would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Let me calculate that: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\\). Okay, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. \n\nNow, the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Hmm, so the coefficient I found, 6, is going to be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, I'm only asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Does that mean I don't need to worry about the other terms in the expansion? Or do I need to consider how the multiplication affects the coefficient? \n\nWait, actually, maybe I do need to consider the entire product. Because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think again. \n\nSo, \\((a + b)^4\\) gives me terms like \\(a^4, a^3b, a^2b^2, ab^3, b^4\\), each with their coefficients. Then, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) will expand into terms involving powers of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). When I multiply these two expansions together, each term from \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nBut the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, in the product, \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term from the second expansion. However, since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. Wait, no, that can't be right because the second part is separate. \n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but the entire expression is a product of two polynomials, one in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and another in \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, actually, the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are independent of the terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). That means when I multiply them, the coefficients for the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms won't be affected by the \\(c\\) terms. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would just be the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nWait, that doesn't make sense because the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would actually be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient isn't a single number but a polynomial in \\(c\\). However, the problem is asking for the coefficient, so maybe I'm supposed to consider the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, or perhaps it's asking for the coefficient in the entire expansion, but that seems more complicated. \n\nWait, perhaps I need to clarify: when the problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", it's referring to the coefficient in the entire product, which includes the \\(c\\) terms. But since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), maybe the coefficient is just 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems odd because the coefficient should be a number, not a polynomial. \n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me read the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, in the product, each term is a product of a term from \\((a + b)^4\\) and a term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term from the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that can't be right because the coefficient is supposed to be a constant, not a function of \\(c\\). \n\nWait, perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, without considering the \\(c\\) terms. So, maybe the coefficient is 6, and the \\(c\\) terms are separate. But that seems unlikely because the problem includes both \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) in the product. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, considering all possible terms, but since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient would just be 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't make sense because the coefficient should be a single number. \n\nWait, perhaps I need to consider that the problem is written as \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), so it's a product of two expressions. Therefore, when you expand the entire product, each term from the first expansion is multiplied by each term from the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term from the second expansion, which are terms involving \\(c^k\\) and \\(c^{-k}\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nBut that can't be right because the coefficient is supposed to be a single number. So, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question. Maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where the exponents of \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are 2, 2, and 0 respectively. That would make sense because then the coefficient would be a single number. \n\nWait, but the problem didn't specify \\(c^0\\), it just said \\(a^2b^2\\). Hmm. Maybe I should assume that the problem wants the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems odd because the coefficient is supposed to be a number, not a polynomial. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is only considering the part of the product where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out, i.e., \\(c^0\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). That might make sense. So, maybe I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire expansion. \n\nIf that's the case, then the coefficient would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, first, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nLet me think about that. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) can be written as \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, the exponent of \\(c\\) in each term is \\(6 - 2k\\). We want the exponent to be 0, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(k = 3\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). \n\nCalculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire product is 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nWait, but the problem didn't specify \\(c^0\\), it just said \\(a^2b^2\\). So, maybe I'm overcomplicating it again. Perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. But in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial, not a single number. \n\nBut the problem is asking for the coefficient, which is usually a single number. So, perhaps I need to interpret it as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). That would make sense because then it's a single term. So, I think that's the right approach. \n\nSo, to recap, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. Then, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire product is 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nWait, but let me double-check. If I expand \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6. Then, expanding \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out is when \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), so \\(k = 3\\), and the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, multiplying these together, 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120. \n\nWait, but let me think again: is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product equal to the product of the coefficients of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and \\(c^0\\) in the second part? Yes, because when you multiply the two expansions, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term from the second part. So, the only term that will contribute to \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is the term where the second part is \\(c^0\\), which has a coefficient of 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nSo, I think that's the answer. But just to make sure, let me consider an alternative approach. Maybe I can think of the entire expression as a product of two polynomials and consider the coefficients accordingly. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use generating functions. The generating function for \\((a + b)^4\\) is straightforward, and the generating function for \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is also known. When you multiply them, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is indeed the product of the coefficients of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial and \\(c^0\\) in the second polynomial. \n\nSo, yes, 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nI think that makes sense. So, the coefficient is 120. \n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem.\n\nFirst, consider the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n\\]\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is found when \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\):\n\\[\n\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\n\\]\n\nNext, consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):\n\\[\n\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n\\]\nWe need the coefficient of \\(c^0\\), which occurs when \\(6 - 2k = 0\\).

So, when I multiply these two expressions together, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will be multiplied by every term from the \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) expansion. But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\), maybe I just need to consider that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6, and then when I multiply by the entire second part, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) will just be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, no, that doesn't seem right because each term in the product would be a combination of terms from both expansions. Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it.\n\nWait, maybe I should think differently. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression. So, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second part. But since the second part involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), the terms in the product will have factors of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2 \\cdot c^{-k}\\) for some \\(k\\). However, the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would include all terms where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2 each, regardless of the exponents of \\(c\\). So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, that doesn't make sense because that would mean the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion, which isn't a single number. Hmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^k\\) for some specific \\(k\\), but it's not stated. Or maybe the problem is only considering the terms where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out, but that's not mentioned either. Wait, no, the problem just says the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so maybe it's considering all possible exponents of \\(c\\), but that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But that seems odd because the problem is asking for a coefficient, which is usually a number. Hmm, maybe I misinterpreted the problem.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, the coefficient for each \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) term would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^k\\) in the second expansion. But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), perhaps it's considering the sum over all \\(k\\), meaning the total coefficient when you collect all terms with \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\). Wait, but that would mean adding up all the coefficients from the second expansion, which is equivalent to evaluating the second expansion at \\(c = 1\\), because substituting \\(c = 1\\) would make each term equal to its coefficient.\n\nLet me check that. If I substitute \\(c = 1\\) into \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), I get \\((1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 * 64 = 384. But wait, is that correct? Let me think again.\n\nWait, no, that might not be correct because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, each term is a product of \\(a^2b^2\\) and a term from the second expansion. So, the coefficient for each \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) term would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^k\\) in the second expansion. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would include all possible \\(c^k\\) terms. So, if we're considering the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) irrespective of \\(c\\), then it's indeed the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by 6. Since the sum of coefficients in the second expansion is when \\(c = 1\\), which is 64, then the total coefficient would be 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nBut wait, another way to think about it is that the entire expression is a product of two polynomials, and when you multiply them, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial. Because when you distribute, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second, so the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first is multiplied by every term in the second, so the coefficients add up. Therefore, yes, the coefficient would be 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me make sure. Alternatively, maybe the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), i.e., where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out. That would be a different approach. In that case, we'd have to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), and then multiply that by 6. So, let's explore that possibility too.\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem again. The expansion is:\n\n\\[\n\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n\\]\n\nWe need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so:\n\n\\[\n6 - 2k = 0 \\implies k = 3\n\\]\n\nSo, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\), which is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Then, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire product would be 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nBut wait, the problem didn't specify any condition on \\(c\\), so maybe it's just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in that case, it's 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. But I'm a bit confused because the problem statement isn't entirely clear. Let me check the problem again.\n\nThe problem says: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but in the entire expression, which includes terms with \\(c\\). So, does that mean we're considering all terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present, regardless of the power of \\(c\\)? In that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which would make the coefficient a polynomial in \\(c\\). But that seems unlikely because the problem is asking for a coefficient, which is typically a number. So, maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where the exponents of \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are 2, 2, and 0 respectively.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\), which would mean that we're treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable and just collecting all terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) appears, each multiplied by some power of \\(c\\). But in that case, the coefficient would be a polynomial, not a single number. Hmm, perhaps I should look for the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\), so that the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out. That seems more plausible because otherwise, the coefficient would be a polynomial, which doesn't make much sense in the context of the problem.\n\nSo, let me proceed under the assumption that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where the exponents of \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are 2, 2, and 0 respectively.\n\nSo, as I found earlier, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. Then, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nBut let me double-check this approach. Another way to think about it is that when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum of the products of the coefficients of terms whose exponents add up to the desired term. So, in this case, to get \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), we need to take the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first polynomial and multiply it by the term \\(c^0\\) from the second polynomial. Since there are no other combinations that would result in \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) because the first polynomial only has \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the second has \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), there's no overlap in variables. So, the coefficient is indeed 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought that if we're just looking for \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\), the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of the second polynomial, which would be 6 * 64 = 384. But that seems to contradict the problem's phrasing, which is more likely asking for a specific term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\), so that the term is just \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, I think the correct approach is to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion and multiply it by 6, giving 120.\n\nLet me verify this by considering the entire expansion. The first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), has the term \\(6a^2b^2\\). The second part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), has a term with coefficient 20 when \\(c^0\\). So, when you multiply these two, you get \\(6a^2b^2 * 20 = 120a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient is 120.\n\nAlternatively, if I consider that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) irrespective of \\(c\\), then it's 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. But that would mean the term is \\(384a^2b^2\\), which includes all powers of \\(c\\). However, I think the problem is more likely asking for the term where \\(c\\) is eliminated, i.e., \\(c^0\\), so the coefficient is 120.\n\nWait, perhaps I should check both interpretations. If the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), then it's 384. If it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it's 120. Since the problem statement doesn't specify, but given that it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), I think it's more plausible that they want the coefficient where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out, i.e., \\(c^0\\). Therefore, the answer would be 120.\n\nBut to be thorough, let me think about how the entire product looks. The product is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). When you expand this, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part, which includes terms like \\(c^6\\), \\(6c^4\\), \\(15c^2\\), \\(20\\), \\(15c^{-2}\\), \\(6c^{-4}\\), and \\(c^{-6}\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the sum of the coefficients from each of these terms multiplied by 6. So, that would be 6*(1 + 6 + 15 + 20 + 15 + 6 + 1) = 6*64 = 384. But wait, that's if we're considering the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would be 384, but that would mean that the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by every possible power of \\(c\\), so the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a coefficient, which is a number.\n\nTherefore, I think the correct interpretation is that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, considering all possible powers of \\(c\\), but that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, which isn't a single number. So, perhaps the problem is expecting the answer 120, as that's the coefficient when \\(c\\) is eliminated.\n\nWait, but to confirm, let me think about the problem again. It says, \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\).\" So, in the product, each term is of the form \\(a^kb^{4 - k}c^m\\), where \\(k\\) ranges from 0 to 4, and \\(m\\) ranges from -6 to 6 in steps of 2. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be present in the product with various exponents of \\(c\\). But if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\), then it's the sum of all coefficients where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any power of \\(c\\). That would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6*64 = 384.\n\nBut wait, that seems a bit odd because the coefficient would then be a scalar multiplied by a polynomial, but that's not standard. Typically, when you ask for the coefficient of a term in a product, you're referring to the coefficient when that term appears with specific exponents for all variables. So, if the problem is asking for \\(a^2b^2\\), without specifying \\(c\\), it's ambiguous. But given the structure of the problem, I think the intended interpretation is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting me to treat \\(c\\) as a separate variable and just find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would involve all possible powers of \\(c\\), but that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, which is not a single number. Therefore, I think the problem is more likely asking for the coefficient when \\(c\\) is eliminated, i.e., \\(c^0\\), so the answer is 120.\n\nWait, but to make sure, let me consider that perhaps the problem is expecting me to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, regardless of \\(c\\). So, that would mean that for each term in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is \\(a^4\\), \\(4a^3b\\), \\(6a^2b^2\\), etc., each is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which has terms like \\(c^6\\), \\(6c^4\\), \\(15c^2\\), \\(20\\), \\(15/c^2\\), \\(6/c^4\\), and \\(1/c^6\\). So, when you multiply \\(6a^2b^2\\) by each of these, you get terms like \\(6a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(36a^2b^2c^4\\), \\(90a^2b^2c^2\\), \\(120a^2b^2\\), \\(90a^2b^2/c^2\\), \\(36a^2b^2/c^4\\), and \\(6a^2b^2/c^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 120, because that's the constant term. All other terms have \\(c\\) raised to some power, so their coefficients are not part of the \\(a^2b^2\\) term unless \\(c^0\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 120.\n\nWait, but if I'm considering the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) irrespective of \\(c\\), then technically, the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial. But that's not a single number, so I think the problem is expecting the answer 120, which is the coefficient when \\(c^0\\).\n\nTherefore, after considering both interpretations, I think the correct answer is 120.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break the problem into two parts using the binomial theorem.\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\):**\n   Using the binomial theorem:\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term containing \\(a^2b^2\\) is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2}a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\n   \\]\n   So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in this part is 6.\n\n2. **Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   Using the binomial theorem:\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n   \\]\n   We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0:\n   \\[\n   6 - 2k = 0 \\implies k = 3\n   \\]\n   The coefficient is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\n   \\]\n\n3. **Combine the results:**\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product is:\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 20 = 120\n   \\]\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}."

    "text": " The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a specific term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\). Let me break it down.\n\nFirst, let me consider just the \\((a + b)^4\\) part. Using the binomial theorem, the expansion will have terms like \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}a^{4 - k}b^k\\) for \\(k = 0\\) to \\(4\\). So, the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) occurs would be when \\(4 - k = 2\\) for \\(a\\) and \\(k = 2\\) for \\(b\\). So, substituting \\(k = 2\\), the coefficient would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Let me compute that: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\nBut wait, the original problem isn't just \\((a + b)^4\\); it's multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I need to consider how this multiplication affects the coefficient I found. Hmm, so the entire expression is the product of two binomial expansions: one in terms of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the other in terms of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). But the problem is only asking about the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). That makes me think that maybe the terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) don't affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), because \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\). Wait, but that doesn't seem right. Let me think again.\n\nWait, no, actually, when you multiply two expressions together, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression. So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I need to consider all possible products where the first part is \\(a^2b^2\\) and the second part is any term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), the terms involving \\(c\\) won't affect the powers of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, that doesn't seem quite right either. Let me clarify.\n\nWait, no, that's not correct because when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I need to consider that in the product, each term from \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by every term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that doesn't seem right because each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) has its own coefficient, so when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), they would just contribute as a coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) times each term in the other expansion. Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating this.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me reread it: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, the expression is a product of two polynomials, one in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the other in \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). Since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are different variables, the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are independent of those involving \\(c\\). Therefore, when I multiply the two expressions, the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) will just be multiplied by the entire expansion of the \\(c\\) terms, but since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that doesn't seem correct because each term in the product would be a combination of \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) terms.\n\nWait, no, actually, no. Because \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), so when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by every term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which seems too large. Maybe I'm making a mistake here.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm confusing the way the terms combine. Let me think again. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when you expand this, each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by every term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) where \\(k\\) ranges from \\(-6\\) to \\(6\\) in steps of 2, I think. But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would be the sum of all the coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) multiplied by the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\). Wait, that makes sense because each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is of the form \\(c^k\\) or \\(c^{-k}\\), so when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), it becomes \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2c^{-k}\\), but the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would require that the \\(c\\) terms are \\(c^0\\), i.e., the constant term. Wait, that's a different approach.\n\nWait, maybe I misread the problem. Let me check again: it says, \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\". So, perhaps it's considering the entire product, and \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), so to get \\(a^2b^2\\), we need to have \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by the constant term (i.e., the term where \\(c^0\\)) from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). That makes more sense. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nOkay, so that seems more accurate. So, first, I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which I already found to be 6. Then, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Once I have both coefficients, I can multiply them together to get the final coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product.\n\nSo, let me compute the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem again, the expansion is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k\\). Simplifying that, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} c^{-k} = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be 0, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\).\n\nCalculating \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\), that's \\(\\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20.\n\nNow, going back to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the other expansion is 20. Since these two terms are multiplied together in the product, the overall coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nWait, let me make sure I didn't miss anything. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\) and is multiplied by the constant term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20. So, 6 times 20 is indeed 120. That seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should think about it differently. If I consider the entire expansion, each term is a product of a term from \\((a + b)^4\\) and a term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, for the term \\(a^2b^2\\), it must come from multiplying \\(a^2b^2\\) by the constant term \\(c^0\\) from the other expansion. Therefore, the coefficient is indeed 6 times 20, which is 120.\n\nI think that makes sense. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break down the problem into two parts using the binomial theorem.\n\n1. **Expanding \\((a + b)^4\\):**\n   Using the binomial theorem, the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is given by:\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term \\(a^2b^2\\) occurs when \\(k = 2\\).

    "text": " \n\nAlright, let's start with the first part: \\((a + b)^4\\). Using the binomial theorem, this should expand to the sum from \\(k = 0\\) to \\(4\\) of \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\\). I need the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so I should find the term where \\(a\\) is squared and \\(b\\) is squared. That means \\(4 - k = 2\\) for the exponent of \\(a\\), so \\(k = 2\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\).\n\nWait, what's \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\)? Let me calculate that. The combination formula is \\(\\dbinom{n}{k} = \\dfrac{n!}{k!(n - k)!}\\). So, plugging in \\(n = 4\\) and \\(k = 2\\), we get \\(\\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. \n\nBut wait, the original expression isn't just \\((a + b)^4\\); it's multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Hmm, does that affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)? Let me think. Since the expression is a product of two separate binomial expansions, the terms from \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) are multiplied together. \n\nSo, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I don't need to worry about the \\(c\\) terms because \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\). That is, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would just be the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and not any specific term involving \\(c\\), perhaps the coefficient remains 6, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms.\n\nWait, no, that doesn't seem quite right. Because when you multiply two polynomials together, each term in the first polynomial gets multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), not a constant. Hmm, but the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not considering the \\(c\\) terms. So, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem.\n\nWait, let me read the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), treating \\(c\\) as another variable. But since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would make the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) a polynomial in \\(c\\), which seems odd because the problem is asking for a single coefficient.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\), i.e., the constant term in \\(c\\). That would make more sense, because otherwise, the coefficient would involve \\(c\\) terms. So, perhaps I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\) in the entire expression.\n\nSo, that would mean I need to compute the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and multiply it by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). That way, the entire term would be \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is just \\(a^2b^2\\), and its coefficient would be the product of the two coefficients.\n\nOkay, that makes sense. So, I already found that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. Now, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me figure that out.\n\nAgain, using the binomial theorem, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k\\). Simplifying the exponents, that becomes \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k - k} = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\).\n\nWe need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\).\n\nCalculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire expression is the product of the two coefficients: 6 (from \\(a^2b^2\\)) times 20 (from \\(c^0\\)), which is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nWait, let me double-check that. So, \\((a + b)^4\\) gives \\(a^2b^2\\) with coefficient 6, and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) gives \\(c^0\\) with coefficient 20. Multiplying these together, the term \\(a^2b^2 \\times c^0\\) will have a coefficient of 6 * 20 = 120. That seems right.\n\nBut just to make sure I didn't make a mistake, let me go through the steps again. First, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Then, in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), looking for the term where \\(c\\) cancels out, so exponent 0. That happens when \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), so \\(k = 3\\), and the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying 6 and 20 gives 120. Yeah, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of the entire expression as a product and see if there's another way to approach it. Let me consider expanding both parts separately and then multiplying the terms. But that might get complicated, so perhaps it's better to stick with the method I used before.\n\nWait, another thought: when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficients multiply for the corresponding terms. So, since \\(a^2b^2\\) is in the first part and \\(c^0\\) is in the second part, their product gives \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is just \\(a^2b^2\\), and the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120. Yeah, that seems consistent.\n\nI think I'm confident now that the coefficient is 120. So, the answer should be 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem.\n\nFirst, consider the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\). Using the binomial theorem, we have:\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n\\]\nWe need the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which corresponds to \\(k = 2\\). The coefficient is:\n\\[\n\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\n\\]\n\nNext, consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem, we have:\n\\[\n\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n\\]\nWe need the coefficient of \\(c^0\\), which corresponds to \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(k = 3\\). The coefficient is:\n\\[\n\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\n\\]\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficients from each expansion:\n\\[\n6 \\times 20 = 120\n\\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}."

Because each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, so the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^5 \\times 1/c\\), etc. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not \\(a^2b^2c^6\\) or any other term involving \\(c\\). So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, because when you multiply by the second part, you're adding more variables, but the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) itself doesn't change. Wait, that can't be right either because when you multiply, you might have multiple terms contributing to \\(a^2b^2\\) if the second expansion had terms that could somehow cancel out the \\(c\\) terms, but that's not possible because \\(c\\) is a separate variable.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try to approach it differently. Since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\), and the other part is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), then when you multiply the two expansions together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't make sense because then the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\), but the problem is just asking for a coefficient, so maybe it's only looking for the numerical coefficient, ignoring the \\(c\\) terms. Wait, but that's not how it works.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question. It says, \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, in the entire product, each term is a combination of powers of \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\), and \\(1/c\\). So, for example, a term could be \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), or \\(a^2b^2c^5 \\times 1/c = a^2b^2c^4\\), etc. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, but \\(a^2b^2\\) alone, without any \\(c\\) terms. Is that possible? Because in the product, every term will have both \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) parts and \\(c\\) parts. So, unless there's a term where the \\(c\\) parts cancel out, but that's only possible if there's a term with \\(c^k\\) multiplied by \\(c^{-k}\\), which would give \\(c^0 = 1\\), so that term would just be a constant. So, perhaps the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the sum of the coefficients of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) times the coefficients of \\(c^{-k}\\) in the second expansion. Hmm, that might make sense.\n\nWait, let me try to clarify. Let me denote the first expansion as \\( (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{i=0}^4 \\dbinom{4}{i} a^{4 - i}b^i \\) and the second expansion as \\( \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = \\sum_{j=0}^6 \\dbinom{6}{j} c^{6 - j} \\times \\left(1/c\\right)^j = \\sum_{j=0}^6 \\dbinom{6}{j} c^{6 - 2j} \\).\n\nSo, when we multiply these two expansions together, each term is \\( \\dbinom{4}{i} a^{4 - i}b^i \\times \\dbinom{6}{j} c^{6 - 2j} \\). Now, we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, in the first expansion, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) occurs when \\(4 - i = 2\\) and \\(i = 2\\), so \\(i = 2\\), and the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n\nNow, when we multiply this term by each term in the second expansion, we get \\(6 \\times \\dbinom{6}{j} a^2b^2 c^{6 - 2j}\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, but the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. Wait, but that doesn't make sense because each multiplication introduces a \\(c\\) term. So, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^k\\) for some \\(k\\), but the problem just says \\(a^2b^2\\), which would imply \\(k = 0\\). So, we need to find the coefficient where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, meaning \\(6 - 2j = 0\\), so \\(j = 3\\).\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient from the first expansion, which is 6, multiplied by the coefficient from the second expansion when \\(j = 3\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, 6 \u00d7 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 120.\n\nWait, but let me check that again. So, in the first part, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. In the second part, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\) because \\(6 - 2j = 0\\) implies \\(j = 3\\). So, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, when you multiply these together, 6 \u00d7 20 = 120. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will have a coefficient of 120 when multiplied by \\(c^0\\), which is just 1. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not missing anything. So, in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term is a product of a term from the first expansion and a term from the second. So, to get a term with \\(a^2b^2\\), we need to take the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion and multiply it by the term from the second expansion that has \\(c^0\\), which is 20. So, 6 \u00d7 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient is 120.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of it as the product of the two expansions, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the sum over all possible j of \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} \\times \\dbinom{6}{j}\\) where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out, i.e., \\(6 - 2j = 0\\). So, j = 3, and thus the coefficient is 6 \u00d7 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but let me confirm this by considering another approach. Let me compute the entire product and see if that makes sense. So, \\((a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). The second expansion, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), is \\(c^6 + 6c^5 \\times 1/c + 15c^4 \\times 1/c^2 + 20c^3 \\times 1/c^3 + 15c^2 \\times 1/c^4 + 6c \\times 1/c^5 + 1/c^6\\). Simplifying, that's \\(c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15/c^2 + 6/c^4 + 1/c^6\\).\n\nNow, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by this, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, for example, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, resulting in terms like \\(6a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(6a^2b^2 \\times 6c^4\\), etc. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would only be present if the \\(c\\) terms cancel out, i.e., when multiplied by \\(c^0 = 1\\). So, in the second expansion, the only term that is \\(c^0\\) is 20. Therefore, the term \\(6a^2b^2 \\times 20 = 120a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120.\n\nWait, that makes sense. So, the coefficient is 120. Let me just check if I made any mistakes in my calculations. So, in the first expansion, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\), correct. In the second expansion, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\), correct. Multiplying them gives 6 \u00d7 20 = 120. Yes, that seems right.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of it as the product of the two polynomials. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the product of the coefficients of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial and the constant term in the second polynomial. Since the second polynomial's constant term is 20, that's correct.\n\nWait, another way: the entire expression is the product of two independent expansions, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion. So, 6 \u00d7 20 = 120. Yep, that seems consistent.\n\nI think that's the correct approach. So, the coefficient is 120.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break down the problem into two parts using the binomial theorem.\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\):**\n   Using the binomial theorem, the expansion is:\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term containing \\(a^2b^2\\) occurs when \\(k = 2\\), so its coefficient is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\n   \\]\n\n2. **Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   Similarly, using the binomial theorem, the expansion is:\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{j=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{j} c^{6 - j} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^j = \\sum_{j=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{j} c^{6 - 2j}\n   \\]\n   The constant term (where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0) occurs when \\(6 - 2j = 0\\), which gives \\(j = 3\\). The coefficient for this term is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\n   \\]\n\n3. **Combine the coefficients:**\n   Since we are looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, we multiply the coefficients from each expansion:\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 20 = 120\n   \\]\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

    "text": " \n\nLet me focus on the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\). I need to find the term that has \\(a^2b^2\\). Using the binomial theorem, the general term is \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\\). I want the exponent of \\(a\\) to be 2 and the exponent of \\(b\\) to be 2. That means \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). So, plugging that into the binomial coefficient, I get \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). \n\nCalculating that, \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. \n\nNow, the expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I wonder if this part affects the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), so when I multiply the two expressions together, the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) will multiply with terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). But since I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), maybe I don't need to worry about the \\(c\\) terms? Or do I?\n\nWait, no, actually, when I multiply two expressions, each term from the first expression gets multiplied by each term from the second expression. But since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are different variables from \\(c\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire second part, because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by any term from the second expression, you just get \\(a^2b^2\\) times that term, but since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), it's just 6 times whatever is in the second part.\n\nWait, no, that doesn't make sense. Because the second part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a separate expression. So, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term from the first is multiplied by each term from the second. But since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient from the first part times the entire expansion of the second part. But that can't be right because then the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\), but the question just asks for the coefficient, so maybe I'm misunderstanding something.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, so maybe it's just 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems odd because the coefficient would then be a polynomial, not a single number. Alternatively, maybe the problem is only considering the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms, but that doesn't make sense either because \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables.\n\nWait, perhaps I misread the problem. Let me check again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" Hmm, maybe the question is just considering the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, so it's 6 times the entire \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, which seems unlikely. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where \\(c\\) cancels out, so the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. That might make more sense.\n\nSo, let me think again. If I consider the entire product, each term will be of the form \\(a^{4 - k}b^k c^{6 - m}(1/c)^m = a^{4 - k}b^k c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, to get \\(a^2b^2\\), I need \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\), as before, so the coefficient from the first part is 6. Then, for the second part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m}(1/c)^m = \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). \n\nNow, if I want the exponent of \\(c\\) to be zero, then \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which gives \\(m = 3\\). So, the coefficient for \\(c^0\\) in the second part is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). \n\nTherefore, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is multiplied by the term \\(c^0\\) in the second part, which has a coefficient of 20. So, the overall coefficient would be 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nWait, so putting it all together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, considering only the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, is 120. That makes sense because otherwise, if we didn't consider the \\(c\\) terms, the coefficient would be a polynomial, which isn't what the question is asking for. \n\nSo, to recap, I first found the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6. Then, I considered the second part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), and found the coefficient of \\(c^0\\), which is 20. Multiplying these together gives 6 * 20 = 120, which is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, considering only the terms where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out. \n\nI think that makes sense. Let me double-check my steps. First, binomial expansion on \\((a + b)^4\\), correct. Then, binomial expansion on \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), correct. Found the coefficients for the specific terms, multiplied them together. Yeah, that seems right. I don't think I made any calculation errors. \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) is indeed 6, and \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\) is 20. So, 6 * 20 is 120. \n\nI guess that's the answer then.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break the problem into two parts:\n\n1. **Expanding \\((a + b)^4\\):**  \n   Using the binomial theorem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is given by the binomial coefficient \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\), which equals 6.\n\n2. **Expanding \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**  \n   We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. This occurs when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), so \\(m = 3\\). The coefficient here is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n\nMultiplying the coefficients from both parts gives the final coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) as \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\(\\boxed{120}\\)"

So, the coefficient should just remain 6.\n\nWait, but maybe I'm missing something. Let me double-check. Suppose I expand both expressions separately. The expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) will have terms like \\(a^4\\), \\(a^3b\\), \\(a^2b^2\\), etc., each multiplied by their respective coefficients. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) will have terms involving powers of \\(c\\), but none of these involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\). So, when I multiply the two expansions together, each term from \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nSo, for the \\(a^2b^2\\) term, it's going to be \\(6a^2b^2\\) multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\), the coefficient will just be 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, that doesn't make sense because the coefficient should be a constant, not an expression involving \\(c\\). \n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the question. It says the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), when expanded, we have terms like \\(a^kb^{4 - k}c^m\\) or \\(a^kb^{4 - k}c^{6 - m}\\), but the problem is asking for the coefficient of the specific term \\(a^2b^2\\). So, regardless of the powers of \\(c\\), the coefficient for each term \\(a^2b^2c^m\\) or \\(a^2b^2c^{6 - m}\\) will be 6 times the corresponding coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nBut wait, the problem doesn't specify any particular power of \\(c\\), so maybe it's just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). In that case, the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that can't be right because the sum of coefficients would be when \\(c = 1\\), which is \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, would the coefficient be 6 * 64 = 384? But that seems too high. \n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think again. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6a\u00b2b\u00b2, and when multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in that expansion will be multiplied by 6a\u00b2b\u00b2. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would actually be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is 6*(something), but coefficients are constants, not expressions with variables. \n\nWait, perhaps the question is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without considering \\(c\\). So, maybe it's just 6, because the other part doesn't affect \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). But that seems too simple. Alternatively, maybe the problem is expecting me to consider that when you multiply, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 6*64=384. But that seems large. \n\nWait, perhaps I should approach it differently. Let me consider that when you multiply two expressions, the coefficient of a specific term is the product of the coefficients from each part. So, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, and in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) (since \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) can cancel each other out) is the middle term, which is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, when you multiply 6 by 20, you get 120 as the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). But the problem didn't specify any power of \\(c\\), so maybe it's just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\)'s power, which would be 6 times the entire expansion, but that's not a single coefficient. \n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Let me try to think of it as a product of two polynomials. The first polynomial is in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the second is in \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, when you multiply them, the variables are independent. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is 6 times a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the coefficient should be a constant. \n\nWait, maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\). That would make sense. So, in that case, I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\) in the product. \n\nSo, to find that, I can consider the product as the product of two separate expansions. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, as we found earlier. Then, in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is the term where the exponents of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) cancel out. So, in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the expansion is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). \n\nWe want the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which implies \\(k = 3\\). So, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). \n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). \n\nWait, but the problem didn't specify \\(c^0\\); it just asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, maybe I'm supposed to consider all possible powers of \\(c\\). But that doesn't make sense because coefficients are specific to the term. So, perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), which would be 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that's not a single coefficient. \n\nWait, maybe the problem is written incorrectly, or perhaps I'm misinterpreting it. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only concerned with the \\(a^2b^2\\) term and ignores the \\(c\\) part, so the coefficient is just 6. But that seems unlikely because the expression includes both parts. \n\nWait, another approach: maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, meaning that when you expand the product, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\) is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because coefficients are constants. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, regardless of the power of \\(c\\), which would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The sum of coefficients in a polynomial is found by setting all variables to 1. So, \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient would be 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nBut that seems high, and I'm not sure if that's the correct interpretation. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and since the other part is multiplied by it, but it doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms, so the coefficient remains 6. \n\nWait, but that doesn't seem right because when you multiply by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), you're essentially scaling the entire expression by that polynomial. So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), it's 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, not a constant. \n\nI'm getting confused here. Maybe I should look at it differently. Let's consider the entire expression:\n\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\left(\\sum_{k=0}^4 \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\\right) \\left(\\sum_{m=0}^6 \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\right)\n\\]\n\nSimplifying the second sum:\n\n\\[\n\\sum_{m=0}^6 \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n\\]\n\nSo, when you multiply these two sums together, each term from the first sum is multiplied by each term from the second sum. So, the term \\(a^{4 - k}b^k c^{6 - 2m}\\) will have a coefficient of \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}\\dbinom{6}{m}\\).\n\nNow, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, we need to find all terms where \\(a^{4 - k}b^k = a^2b^2\\). That happens when \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\), so \\(k = 2\\). So, the coefficient from the first part is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). \n\nNow, since \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term from the second sum, which is \\(c^{6 - 2m}\\), the coefficient for each such term in the product will be \\(6 \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, that would mean we need to sum over all \\(m\\) from 0 to 6, because each term \\(a^2b^2c^{6 - 2m}\\) has a coefficient of \\(6 \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}\\). \n\nWait, but that would mean the coefficient is \\(6 \\times \\sum_{m=0}^6 \\dbinom{6}{m}\\). The sum of binomial coefficients \\(\\sum_{m=0}^6 \\dbinom{6}{m} = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the coefficient would be \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). \n\nBut that seems like a lot. Alternatively, maybe the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, which doesn't make sense. \n\nWait, perhaps the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and since the other part doesn't affect \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), the coefficient remains 6. But that seems too simple, and I feel like I'm missing something. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is expecting me to consider that the entire product is a single expression, and the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, which doesn't make sense. \n\nWait, perhaps the problem is only concerned with the \\(a^2b^2\\) term, and the \\(c\\) terms are irrelevant, so the coefficient is just 6. But that seems unlikely because the problem includes both parts. \n\nWait, another approach: maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, considering all possible powers of \\(c\\). So, that would mean the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 6*64=384. \n\nBut let me check that. The sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, if I multiply that by 6, I get 384. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\) would be 384. \n\nBut I'm not entirely sure if that's the correct interpretation. Alternatively, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and since the other part is multiplied by it, the coefficient remains 6. \n\nWait, perhaps I should look at an example. Let's say I have \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, expanding \\((a + b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2\\), and \\((c + 1/c)^1 = c + 1/c\\). So, the product is \\(a^2(c + 1/c) + 2ab(c + 1/c) + b^2(c + 1/c)\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) is \\(c + 1/c\\), the coefficient of \\(ab\\) is 2(c + 1/c), and the coefficient of \\(b^2\\) is \\(c + 1/c\\). \n\nSo, in this case, the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) is a polynomial in \\(c\\), not a constant. So, in the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial, not a constant. \n\nBut the problem is asking for the coefficient, which is usually a constant. So, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be a constant. \n\nSo, to find that, as I did earlier, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 20, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is 6*20=120. \n\nAlternatively, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), then it's 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which would be a polynomial, but that seems unlikely because coefficients are constants. \n\nWait, perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and since the other terms don't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), the coefficient remains 6. \n\nBut I'm not sure. Let me try to verify. If I expand \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), resulting in terms like \\(6a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(6a^2b^2c^4\\), \\(6a^2b^2c^2\\), \\(6a^2b^2c^0\\), \\(6a^2b^2c^{-2}\\), etc. So, each of these terms has a coefficient of 6 multiplied by the respective coefficient from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). \n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial, not a single constant. \n\nBut the problem is asking for the coefficient, which is a constant. So, perhaps the problem is only interested in the constant term with respect to \\(c\\), i.e., \\(c^0\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6*20=120. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is expecting me to realize that since the \\(c\\) terms are separate, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just 6, and the rest is part of the \\(c\\) terms. \n\nWait, perhaps I should think of it as a product of two independent variables. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the same as the coefficient in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and the \\(c\\) terms are separate. So, the coefficient is 6. \n\nBut I'm not entirely confident. Let me try to think of it another way. If I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = (1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, the entire expression becomes \\((a + b)^4 * 64\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in that case would be 6*64=384. \n\nBut if I set \\(c = 1\\), I'm essentially evaluating the expression at \\(c = 1\\), which gives me the sum of all coefficients. So, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\), then it's 384. \n\nAlternatively, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it's 120. \n\nWait, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and since the expression is a product, the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which would be a polynomial. But coefficients are typically constants, so perhaps the problem is miswritten, or perhaps I'm misinterpreting it. \n\nWait, perhaps the problem is written as \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), and it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is 6, because the other part doesn't affect \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). \n\nBut I'm not sure. Let me try to look for similar problems. Usually, when you have a product of two polynomials, the coefficient of a term in one polynomial is independent of the other variables. So, in this case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be 6, and the rest would be part of the \\(c\\) terms. \n\nAlternatively, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it's 120. \n\nWait, perhaps I should consider that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, which would include all possible powers of \\(c\\). So, that would mean the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but that's a polynomial, not a constant. \n\nI'm stuck here. Maybe I should go back to the basics. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). \n\nLet me think about how the product works. When you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is actually a polynomial in \\(c\\), where each term is \\(6 \\times \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). \n\nBut the problem is asking for the coefficient, which is usually a constant. So, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120, or perhaps it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), which would be a polynomial, but that seems unlikely. \n\nWait, perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and since the other part is multiplied by it, the coefficient remains 6. \n\nBut I'm not sure. Let me try to think differently. Maybe the problem is written as \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), and it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so I should treat \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) as separate variables, but since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are different variables, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just 6, and the rest is part of the \\(c\\) terms. \n\nWait, but that seems too simple. Let me check with specific values. Suppose I set \\(a = 1\\), \\(b = 1\\), \\(c = 1\\). Then, the expression becomes \\((1 + 1)^4 \\times (1 + 1)^6 = 16 \\times 64 = 1024\\). The term \\(a^2b^2\\) when \\(a = 1\\), \\(b = 1\\) is 1*1=1, so the coefficient times 1 would be 6. But in the product, the total is 1024, which includes all terms. So, that doesn't help much. \n\nAlternatively, if I set \\(a = 1\\), \\(b = 1\\), \\(c = 1\\), the value is 1024, which is the sum of all coefficients. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times the sum of coefficients in \\(c\\) is 6*64=384, which is part of the total 1024. So, that suggests that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 384 when considering all \\(c\\) terms. \n\nWait, but if I set \\(a = 1\\), \\(b = 1\\), \\(c = 1\\), the total value is 1024, which is the sum of all coefficients. So, the sum of coefficients of \\(a^2b^2\\) times the sum of coefficients in \\(c\\) is 6*64=384. So, that suggests that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 384. \n\nBut I'm not sure if that's the correct interpretation. Alternatively, if I set \\(a = 1\\), \\(b = 1\\), \\(c = 1\\), the value is 1024, which is the sum of all coefficients, including \\(a^2b^2\\). So, to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I can set \\(a = 1\\), \\(b = 1\\), \\(c = 1\\), and then divide by the number of terms? No, that doesn't make sense. \n\nWait, perhaps I can use the multinomial theorem or generating functions. Alternatively, maybe I should consider that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6*64=384. \n\nSo, perhaps the answer is 384. \n\nBut earlier, I thought it was 120 when considering \\(c^0\\). \n\nWait, perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), which would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial. But since the problem is asking for the coefficient, which is a constant, perhaps it's expecting 384. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is written incorrectly, and it's supposed to ask for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. \n\nWait, let me try to look for the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\), and it's multiplied by each term from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, each such term is \\(6a^2b^2c^{6 - 2m}\\), where \\(m\\) ranges from 0 to 6. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial. \n\nBut the problem is asking for the coefficient, which is a constant, so perhaps it's expecting me to consider that the coefficient is 6, and the rest is part of the \\(c\\) terms. \n\nWait, I'm really confused now. Let me try to think differently. Maybe the problem is only about the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) parts, and the \\(c\\) part is irrelevant. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just 6. \n\nBut that seems too simple, and I feel like I'm missing something. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is expecting me to compute the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, which would involve summing over all possible \\(c\\) terms. So, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6*64=384. \n\nSo, I think that's the answer they're looking for. \n\nWait, but let me double-check. The sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 64, so 6*64=384. \n\nYes, that makes sense. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 384. \n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was 120 when considering \\(c^0\\). So, which one is correct? \n\nI think the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), which would be 384. \n\nAlternatively, if it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), it's 120. \n\nBut the problem just says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", so I think it's 384. \n\nWait, but in the expansion, each term is of the form \\(a^kb^{4 - k}c^{6 - 2m}\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the sum over all \\(m\\) of \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\), which is 6*64=384. \n\nYes, that seems correct. So, the coefficient is 384. \n\nWait, but I'm still not entirely sure. Let me think about it differently. If I set \\(c = 1\\), then the expression becomes \\((a + b)^4 \\times 64\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in that case would be 6*64=384. \n\nYes, that makes sense. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 384. \n\nSo, after all that, I think the answer is 384. \n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was 120. Hmm. \n\nWait, perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and since the other part is multiplied by it, the coefficient remains 6. \n\nBut that seems too simple, and I think the problem is more likely expecting 384. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting me to consider that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, and the rest is part of the \\(c\\) terms, so the coefficient is 6. \n\nWait, but that doesn't seem right because when you multiply by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), you're scaling the entire expression. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial. \n\nBut the problem is asking for the coefficient, which is a constant, so I think the answer is 384. \n\nWait, but I'm not 100% sure. Maybe I should check with a smaller exponent to see. Let's say I have \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). The expansion is \\((a^2 + 2ab + b^2)(c + 1/c)\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) is \\(c + 1/c\\), the coefficient of \\(ab\\) is 2(c + 1/c), and the coefficient of \\(b^2\\) is \\(c + 1/c\\). \n\nSo, in this case, the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) is a polynomial, not a constant. So, in the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be a polynomial. \n\nBut the problem is asking for the coefficient, which is a constant, so perhaps the problem is miswritten or I'm misinterpreting it. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. \n\nWait, let me think. If I have \\((a + b)^4 \\times (c + 1/c)^6\\), and I want the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\((c + 1/c)^6\\), which is 20. So, 6*20=120. \n\nSo, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. \n\nBut the problem didn't specify \\(c^0\\), so I'm not sure. \n\nWait, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and since the \\(c\\) terms are separate, the coefficient is 6. \n\nBut that seems too simple, and I think the intended answer is 120, considering \\(c^0\\). \n\nWait, perhaps I should go with 120. \n\nWait, let me check again. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\((c + 1/c)^6\\) is 20. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is 6*20=120. \n\nYes, that makes sense. So, the answer is 120. \n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was 384 when considering all coefficients. \n\nI think the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. \n\nSo, after all that, I think the answer is 120. \n\nWait, but I'm still confused because the problem didn't specify \\(c^0\\). \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, regardless of \\(c\\), which would be 384. \n\nBut I think the more reasonable interpretation is that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. \n\nSo, I think I'll go with 120 as the answer. \n\nWait, but let me check one more time. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\((c + 1/c)^6"

    "text": " The problem is specifically asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\).\n\nLet me focus on \\((a + b)^4\\) first. I need to find the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2. So, in the binomial expansion, each term is \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\\). I need \\(4 - k = 2\\) for \\(a\\), which means \\(k = 2\\) for \\(b\\). So, the coefficient here would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Let me calculate that: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6.\n\nNow, the expression also has another part: \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Hmm, but the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, does this second part affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)? Let me think. Since the second part is multiplied by the first part, the entire expression is a product of two expansions. So, when you multiply them, each term from the first expansion is multiplied by each term from the second expansion.\n\nBut the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the first part, right? Because the second part involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), so when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by something involving \\(c\\), you get terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2/c^k\\). But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term without any \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\). So, does that mean I need to find the terms in the second expansion that are constants, i.e., where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out? Because if I multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by a constant term from the second expansion, that would give me a term with just \\(a^2b^2\\), which is what we're interested in.\n\nWait, but hold on. Let me clarify. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product. That is, the coefficient would be the sum of all the products where a term from the first expansion (which has \\(a^2b^2\\)) is multiplied by a term from the second expansion that doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), because any term with \\(c\\) would make the term have \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), which we don't want.\n\nBut wait, actually, no. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) is just a part of the expansion, but when multiplied by the second expansion, each term would have \\(a^2b^2\\) times something. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would actually be the sum of all the coefficients from the second expansion that, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), give a term that is just \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, but that doesn't make sense because the second expansion has terms with \\(c\\), so unless those terms are constants, they can't contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\).\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, when you expand this, you get terms that are products of terms from each expansion. So, to get a term with \\(a^2b^2\\), you need to multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion by a term from the second expansion that is a constant, because otherwise, you'll have \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2/c^k\\), which aren't just \\(a^2b^2\\).\n\nSo, in the second expansion, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), we need to find the constant term, which is the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. So, let me find that term. Using the binomial theorem again, each term in the expansion is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(1/c\\right)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We want the exponent of \\(c\\) to be zero, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\).\n\nTherefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} c^{0} = \\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n\nSo, the constant term in the second expansion is 20. Therefore, when we multiply the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion (which has a coefficient of 6) by the constant term 20 from the second expansion, we get \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't miss anything. So, in the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. In the second part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the constant term is 20. So, when we multiply these two, the coefficient becomes 6 * 20 = 120. So, yes, that seems right.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should think of it as the entire product. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) can only come from multiplying \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion by a constant term in the second expansion. Since there are no other ways to get \\(a^2b^2\\) without involving \\(c\\), the coefficient is just 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nI think that makes sense. So, the coefficient is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is found by considering the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) and the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\n1. From \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n2. From \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n3. Multiply these coefficients: \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

    "text": " \n\nThe first part of the expression is \\((a + b)^4\\). Let me expand that first. Using the binomial theorem, this would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{0}a^4b^0 + \\dbinom{4}{1}a^3b^1 + \\dbinom{4}{2}a^2b^2 + \\dbinom{4}{3}a^1b^3 + \\dbinom{4}{4}a^0b^4\\). Calculating those coefficients: \\(\\dbinom{4}{0} = 1\\), \\(\\dbinom{4}{1} = 4\\), \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\), \\(\\dbinom{4}{3} = 4\\), and \\(\\dbinom{4}{4} = 1\\). So, the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is \\(a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\).\n\nNow, the problem asks for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Looking at the expansion, the term with \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(6a^2b^2\\), so the coefficient is 6. But wait, the expression isn't just \\((a + b)^4\\); it's multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I need to consider how this multiplication affects the coefficient I'm looking for.\n\nLet me think about this. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When I multiply two expressions together, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by every term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nBut here's the thing: when we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, we don't actually care about the \\(c\\) terms because \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\). That means the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) will be the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, no, that's not quite right. Because each term in the product will be a combination of a term from \\((a + b)^4\\) and a term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nBut since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), the coefficient will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, the coefficient gets multiplied by each term's coefficient, and since we don't care about the \\(c\\) part, we just sum all those contributions.\n\nWait, no, that might not be the case. Let me think again. If we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, it's actually the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is being multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), so the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will get multiplied by every term in the second expansion, each contributing their own coefficient. Therefore, the total coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be 6 (the coefficient from the first expansion) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion.\n\nSo, I need to find the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). How do I do that? Well, the sum of the coefficients in a polynomial is found by setting all variables to 1. So, if I substitute \\(c = 1\\) into the expression, I'll get the sum of the coefficients. Let me try that.\n\nSubstituting \\(c = 1\\), we have \\(\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = (1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 multiplied by 64, which is 384.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. Is the sum of the coefficients actually 64? Let me double-check that. \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) when \\(c = 1\\) is indeed \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, that part seems correct. And in the first expansion, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. So, multiplying them together gives 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nBut wait another thought: when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the resulting expression will have terms like \\(a^kb^{4 - k} \\times c^m c^{-n}\\), where \\(m + n = 6\\). But since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), the coefficient for each \\(a^kb^{4 - k}\\) will be multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) will indeed be 6 times the sum of the coefficients of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 64. So, 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of it as the product of the two expressions. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient in the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part because each term in the second part is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). So, yeah, 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me consider if there's another way to approach this. Maybe I can expand both expressions separately and then look for the coefficient. But that seems more complicated because the second expression is a bit more involved. Let me try that approach just to verify.\n\nFirst, I know \\((a + b)^4\\) expands to \\(a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\), as I did before. Now, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) can be expanded using the binomial theorem as well. The expansion is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\) for \\(k = 0\\) to \\(6\\).\n\nSo, the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is:\n\n- When \\(k=0\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{0}c^6 = 1 \\times c^6 = c^6\\)\n- \\(k=1\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{1}c^{4} = 6c^4\\)\n- \\(k=2\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{2}c^{2} = 15c^2\\)\n- \\(k=3\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}c^{0} = 20\\)\n- \\(k=4\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{4}c^{-2} = 15c^{-2}\\)\n- \\(k=5\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{5}c^{-4} = 6c^{-4}\\)\n- \\(k=6\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{6}c^{-6} = 1c^{-6}\\)\n\nSo, the expansion is \\(c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15c^{-2} + 6c^{-4} + c^{-6}\\).\n\nNow, when I multiply this by \\((a + b)^4\\), each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in this expansion. So, for the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which has a coefficient of 6, it will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product will be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion because each term in the second expansion has a coefficient, and when you multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), those coefficients just add up.\n\nWait, but the second expansion has both positive and negative exponents of \\(c\\). Does that affect the coefficient? No, because we're only concerned with the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) will be 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, as I found before. So, 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, if I didn't realize that the sum of coefficients is 64, I could just add up all the coefficients from the second expansion. Let's see: the coefficients are 1, 6, 15, 20, 15, 6, 1. Adding them up: 1 + 6 = 7, 7 + 15 = 22, 22 + 20 = 42, 42 + 15 = 57, 57 + 6 = 63, 63 + 1 = 64. Yep, that checks out.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not missing anything. Is there a possibility that when I multiply, some terms might combine in a way that affects the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)? For example, could there be cross terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c\\) terms and then those \\(c\\) terms interact with other parts of the expression to somehow affect the coefficient? Hmm, no, because when we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) contributes its own coefficient when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). So, all those coefficients just add up, giving 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, another way to think about it: the entire expression is the product of two polynomials, one in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the other in \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). Since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are independent variables, the coefficients for the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are independent of the coefficients involving \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is simply the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\).\n\nYes, that makes sense. So, I think I'm confident that the coefficient is 384.\n\nWait, but just to be thorough, let me consider an alternative approach. Suppose I don't think about the sum of coefficients. Instead, I could consider that when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), and then those would all add up. But that's essentially the same as saying 6 times the sum of the coefficients, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, if I were to write out the entire product, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) would be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), so the \\(a^2b^2\\) term would be multiplied by all the terms in the second expansion, each contributing their own coefficient. So, the total coefficient would be 6 * (1 + 6 + 15 + 20 + 15 + 6 + 1) = 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nI think that's solid. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 384.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{384}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem and properties of polynomial multiplication.\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term with \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\\).

Let me calculate that: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\).

So, if I have \\(6a^2b^2\\) from the first part and I multiply it by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which expands to various terms involving \\(c\\), then each term in the product will be of the form \\(6a^2b^2 \\times \\text{term from } \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and the \\(c\\) terms are separate, maybe the coefficient remains 6 regardless of the \\(c\\) part.\n\nWait, that doesn't seem right. Because when you multiply, you have to consider all possible combinations, but since the \\(c\\) terms are separate variables, they don't interact with \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would just be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't make sense because the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) would be when \\(c = 1\\), which is \\(2^6 = 64\\). But wait, no, that might not be the case here.\n\nHold on, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, actually, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from those involving \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is 6 times something, but I'm not sure what.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to consider that when I multiply the two expansions, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by every term in the second expansion, but the problem is only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that can't be right because the sum of coefficients is when you set all variables to 1, so \\(c = 1\\), which would make \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). So, does that mean the coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384?\n\nWait, but that seems too high. Let me think again. Maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. It says, \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\" in the entire expression. But in the entire expression, \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are only in the first part, and \\(c\\) is only in the second part. So, when you multiply them, the variables \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are separate. Therefore, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by every term in the second expansion, each of which is a power of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is indeed 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nBut wait, let me check that. If I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = 64\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 * 64 = 384. But I'm not sure if that's the correct approach. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), which would mean that the coefficient is just 6, and the \\(c\\) terms are separate. But that doesn't seem right either.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misapplying the multiplication. Let me think about it differently. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When you expand this, each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, each of which is of the form \\(c^k\\) or \\(c^{-k}\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is indeed 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nBut let me confirm this by considering a simpler case. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^1 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, expanding, we get \\(a \\times (c + 1/c) + b \\times (c + 1/c)\\). The coefficient of \\(a\\) would be \\(c + 1/c\\), but if we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a\\) regardless of \\(c\\), it's just 1 times the sum of coefficients in the second part, which is \\(1 + 1 = 2\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a\\) would be 2. Similarly, the coefficient of \\(b\\) would be 2. So, in this case, the coefficient of \\(a\\) is indeed 2, which is 1 times 2.\n\nApplying that logic to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). The sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, 6 * 64 = 384. Therefore, the coefficient is 384.\n\nWait, but let me think again. When I set \\(c = 1\\), I'm finding the sum of the coefficients in the second part, which is 64. So, when I multiply that by the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, I get 384. So, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, in that case, the coefficient would indeed be 6 times 64, which is 384.\n\nWait, but let me check another way. Let's consider the entire expansion. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first part, which is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\\). Then, when we multiply this by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in the second expansion will be multiplied by 6a^2b^2. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So, I think the coefficient is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Then, since the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we need to consider the sum of all coefficients in this part, which is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), giving \\(2^6 = 64\\). Multiplying these together, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\(\\boxed{384}\\)."

So, the term will be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} a^{2}b^{2}\\). Let me calculate \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). That's 4! / (2! * (4 - 2)!) = (24)/(2 * 2) = 24 / 4 = 6. So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. \n\nBut wait, the problem is asking for the coefficient in the entire expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I think I need to consider the other part as well, which is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are in the first part and \\(c\\) is in the second, maybe the coefficients from both parts multiply together? Hmm, not sure yet. Let me think.\n\nWait, actually, when you multiply two expressions together, the coefficients of the terms multiply if the variables are independent. So, since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire second part evaluated at a certain term, but wait, actually, no. Because the second part doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), so maybe it's just the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part? Hmm, that doesn't sound right.\n\nWait, no, actually, when you multiply two expressions, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), that term comes only from the product of the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first part and the constant term (i.e., the term with no \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\)) in the second part. Because if I take any other term from the second part, it would have a \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), which would make the entire term have \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\) in it, but the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\). So, I think I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and multiply it by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) (i.e., the constant term) in the second part.\n\nSo, let me confirm that. The first part gives me 6 for \\(a^2b^2\\), and the second part, when expanded, will have a term where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out, meaning \\(c^0\\), which is just 1. So, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nAlright, so let's apply the binomial theorem again to \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} c^{-k} = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be 0, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\).\n\nTherefore, the term where \\(k = 3\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} c^{0}\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Let me calculate that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part is 20.\n\nNow, going back to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficients from both parts. So, that would be 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the second part). So, 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but hold on a second. Let me make sure I'm not missing anything. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are only in the first part, and the second part only involves \\(c\\), when I multiply them together, the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) don't interact with the terms involving \\(c\\). So, the only way to get a term with \\(a^2b^2\\) is to take the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part and the constant term from the second part. So, yes, their coefficients multiply, giving 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nLet me just recap to make sure I didn't skip any steps. First, I expanded \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem and found the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. Then, I considered the second part \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), found the coefficient of the constant term \\(c^0\\), which is 20. Then, I multiplied these two coefficients together to get 120 as the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression.\n\nI think that makes sense. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning. So, I'm confident that the coefficient is 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem.\n\nFirst, we expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n\\]\nWe are looking for the term where the exponent of \\(a\\) is 2 and the exponent of \\(b\\) is 2. This corresponds to \\(k = 2\\):\n\\[\n\\dbinom{4}{2} a^{2}b^{2} = 6a^2b^2\n\\]\nSo, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\nNext, we consider the second part \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). We need the coefficient of the constant term \\(c^0\\). Using the binomial theorem:\n\\[\n\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n\\]\nWe need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be 0, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(k = 3\\). The term is:\n\\[\n\\dbinom{6}{3} c^{0} = 20\n\\]\nSo, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20.\n\nMultiplying the coefficients from both parts, we get:\n\\[\n6 \\times 20 = 120\n\\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

    "text": " The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so I guess I need to find the term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) that has \\(a^2b^2\\). \n\nLet me write that out. For \\((a + b)^4\\), the expansion will have terms from \\(a^4\\) down to \\(b^4\\). The general term is \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}a^{4 - k}b^k\\). So, when \\(k = 2\\), the term will be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}a^{2}b^{2}\\). Calculating the binomial coefficient, \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) is \\(\\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\\). So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), is 6. \n\nNow, the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I need to consider how this multiplication affects the coefficient I just found. Wait, but actually, the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is part of the product. So, maybe I don't need to worry about the other parts of the expansion involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) because they won't affect the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. Or do I?\n\nWait, no. Because when you multiply two expressions together, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression. So, if I have \\((a + b)^4\\) times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first part will be multiplied by every term in the second part. But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), I think that the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms is if the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), contributes a term that is \\(c^0\\), meaning \\(c^0 = 1\\). Because then, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), it would just be \\(a^2b^2\\), and the coefficient would be the product of the coefficients from both expansions.\n\nSo, perhaps I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me work on that. Again, using the binomial theorem, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) can be expanded as \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying that, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m} = \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, we want the exponent of \\(c\\) to be 0, which means \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). \n\nTherefore, the term with \\(c^0\\) is when \\(m = 3\\), and the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part is 20.\n\nNow, going back to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficients from each part, because \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first expansion and \\(c^0\\) comes from the second expansion. So, 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the second part) equals 120.\n\nWait, let me make sure I didn't miss anything. The first part gives me 6 for \\(a^2b^2\\), and the second part gives me 20 for \\(c^0\\). Since these are multiplied together, the overall coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120.\n\nI think that makes sense. Let me just recap to ensure I didn't make a mistake. For \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. For \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Multiplying them gives 120. Yeah, that seems correct. I don't think I missed any steps. So, I'm confident the answer is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is found using the binomial theorem, which gives 6. The coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is also found using the binomial theorem, resulting in 20.

So, set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\).\n\nCalculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\).

That is, 6 (from \\(a^2b^2\\)) multiplied by 20 (the constant term).\n\nSo, 6 times 20 is 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120.\n\nWait, let me double-check that. So, \\((a + b)^4\\) gives 6 for \\(a^2b^2\\), and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) gives 20 as the constant term.

So, does that mean I need to consider how the two expansions interact? Or is it just the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the entire second part? Hmm, no, I think it's asking for the coefficient of the term that has \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, in other words, I just need the coefficient from the first part, because the second part doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) exponents. \n\nBut let me think again. When you multiply two polynomials, the exponents add. So, for example, if I have a term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part and a term \\(c^k\\) from the second part, the resulting term would be \\(a^2b^2c^k\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not \\(a^2b^2c^k\\). So, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just the coefficient from the first part, because the second part doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\). So, it's just 6.\n\nWait, but that seems too straightforward. Let me check. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient in the entire expansion, considering all possible terms. But no, the way the problem is phrased, it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a specific term in the product. Since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), the coefficient would just be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which doesn't make sense because the coefficient of a term in a product is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms. Wait, no, actually, in this case, since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), when you multiply it by the entire second expression, it's like \\(a^2b^2 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would actually be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that can't be right because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, not an expression involving \\(c\\). \n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the question. Perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where \\(c\\) cancels out. Because if we multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the only way to get a term without \\(c\\) is if the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. So, maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nThat makes more sense. So, the problem might be a bit of a trick question, and it's actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). So, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) and then multiply it by the coefficient from the first part, which is 6.\n\nOkay, so let me work on that. So, first, I found that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. Now, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me expand that using the binomial theorem as well.\n\nSo, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\).\n\nI need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so I set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), I get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). So, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\).\n\nCalculating \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\): \\(\\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire product is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). \n\nWait, but the problem just says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\". If it's only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, then it would be 6, because in the product, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the entire expansion of the second part, which would make the coefficient a polynomial in \\(c\\). But that doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. So, perhaps I was right the first time, and the problem actually wants the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is written incorrectly, and it's supposed to be \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), but it's written as \\(a^2b^2\\). Hmm. Let me think. If the problem is written as is, then perhaps the answer is 6, but that seems too simple, and the second part is there for a reason. So, maybe the problem is expecting me to consider that the entire expression is a product, and the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the entire expansion of the second part, which would be a sum involving \\(c\\). But that doesn't make sense because the question is asking for a coefficient, which should be a number, not an expression. Therefore, I think the intended question is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nSo, to recap, I found that in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. Then, in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Multiplying these together gives 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is 120, which I think is what the problem is asking for.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. If I expand \\((a + b)^4\\), I get terms with different powers of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). Then, when I multiply by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, for the term \\(a^2b^2\\), it's multiplied by all the terms in the second expansion, resulting in \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), \\(a^2b^2c^2\\), \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), \\(a^2b^2c^{-2}\\), etc. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would actually be the sum of all the coefficients from the second expansion, because each term is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). But wait, no, that's not correct because each term in the second expansion has a different power of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is actually the entire expansion of the second part, but that can't be right because coefficients are numbers, not polynomials. \n\nI think I'm getting confused here. Let me clarify: when you have two polynomials multiplied together, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the product of the coefficients of the terms that multiply together to give that specific term. So, in this case, to get \\(a^2b^2\\), you need to take the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first polynomial and multiply it by a term from the second polynomial that doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\). But the second polynomial only involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), so any term from the second polynomial will have some power of \\(c\\). Therefore, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be multiplied by each term in the second polynomial, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), etc. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is actually 6 times the entire expansion of the second polynomial, which would mean that the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for a coefficient, which is a number, so that suggests that the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is a specific term where \\(c\\) cancels out. \n\nTherefore, I think the correct approach is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 6 multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion, which is 20, giving 120. So, the final answer should be 120.\n\nLet me just make sure I didn't make any mistakes in my calculations. For \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). For \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term with \\(c^0\\) occurs when the exponent is zero, which happens at \\(m = 3\\), so \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying 6 and 20 gives 120. Yeah, that seems correct.\n\nI think I've got it. So, the coefficient is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is found by first determining the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) and then multiplying it by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\n1. From \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n2. From \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n3. Multiplying these gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{120}"

    "text": " \n\nAlright, the first part is \\((a + b)^4\\). Let me write out the expansion of that. Using the binomial theorem, this should be \\(\\dbinom{4}{0}a^4b^0 + \\dbinom{4}{1}a^3b^1 + \\dbinom{4}{2}a^2b^2 + \\dbinom{4}{3}a^1b^3 + \\dbinom{4}{4}a^0b^4\\). Calculating the coefficients, that would be \\(1a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + 1b^4\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in this part is 6. \n\nBut wait, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I need to consider both parts. However, I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are in the first part, and \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) are in the second part, maybe the variables \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) don't affect the coefficients of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). Is that right? \n\nLet me think. When you multiply two polynomials together, each term from the first polynomial is multiplied by each term from the second polynomial. So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I need to find all the ways that \\(a^2b^2\\) can be multiplied by terms from the second part without changing the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). That is, I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and then multiply it by the entire second part, because any term in the second part will just add more variables or constants, but not affect the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). \n\nWait, is that correct? Let me make sure. Suppose I have \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part and, say, \\(c^k\\) from the second part. Then, the term would be \\(a^2b^2c^k\\). But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. But that seems a bit off because the second part is also being expanded. Wait, no, actually, when you multiply two polynomials, each term from the first is multiplied by each term from the second, so the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial. \n\nWait, no, that's not quite right either. Let me think again. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^4 = P(a, b)\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = Q(c)\\). Then, the product is \\(P(a, b) \\times Q(c)\\). Since \\(P(a, b)\\) and \\(Q(c)\\) are in different variables, the coefficients in \\(P(a, b)\\) don't get multiplied by coefficients in \\(Q(c)\\); instead, each term in \\(P(a, b)\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(Q(c)\\). But when we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), that term is present only in \\(P(a, b)\\), and when multiplied by any term in \\(Q(c)\\), it becomes \\(a^2b^2 \\times\\) something. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(P(a, b)\\) multiplied by the entire sum of coefficients in \\(Q(c)\\). \n\nWait, no, that's not right. Because in reality, when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(P(a, b)\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(Q(c)\\). Because \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't interact with \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\); it's just multiplied by each term in \\(Q(c)\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(P(a, b)\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(Q(c)\\). \n\nBut let me verify this. Let's take a simpler example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1)^1\\). The expansion of \\((a + b)^2\\) is \\(a^2 + 2ab + b^2\\), and the expansion of \\((c + 1)\\) is \\(c + 1\\). So, multiplying them together, we get \\(a^2c + a^2 + 2abc + 2ab + b^2c + b^2\\). Now, the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) in this product is \\(c + 1\\), which is the sum of coefficients in the second polynomial. Similarly, the coefficient of \\(ab\\) is \\(2(c + 1)\\), and so on. So, yes, in this case, the coefficient of a specific term in the first polynomial times the entire second polynomial is the coefficient of that term in the product. \n\nTherefore, applying that to our problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nSo, first, let's find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\). As I calculated earlier, that's 6. \n\nNext, I need to find the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The sum of coefficients in a polynomial is found by setting all variables to 1. So, if I substitute \\(c = 1\\) into \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), I get \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial is 64. \n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). \n\nWait, but let me think again. Is that correct? Because when I substitute \\(c = 1\\), I get the sum of all coefficients, but in our case, the variables are separate. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is indeed 6 times 64, which is 384. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I can approach it differently. Let's consider the entire expression: \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). To find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I can treat the two parts separately because they involve different variables. \n\nIn other words, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is equal to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the coefficient of any term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but since we're only interested in the coefficient, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, it's just the product of the two coefficients. \n\nWait, no, that's not exactly right. Because the second part isn't just a constant; it's a polynomial in \\(c\\). So, when you multiply, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second. But since we're only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, the coefficient would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the sum of all coefficients in the second part. \n\nWait, I think that's the same as what I did before. So, the sum of all coefficients in the second part is 64, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of it as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6, and since the second part can be any term, but we're not restricting \\(c\\), so the coefficient gets multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part, which is 64. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of it as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times the coefficient of any term in the second part, but since we're not restricting the power of \\(c\\), we have to consider all possible terms, which effectively means multiplying by the sum of all coefficients. \n\nSo, I think that's correct. Therefore, the coefficient is 384. \n\nWait, but let me check my reasoning again. Let's say I have two polynomials, P and Q, where P is in variables a and b, and Q is in variable c. Then, the product P * Q will have terms like term from P multiplied by term from Q. So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of a specific term in P, say \\(a^2b^2\\), then in the product, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in P multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in Q, because each term in Q is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). \n\nYes, that makes sense. So, in our case, the sum of all coefficients in Q is 64, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of it as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the product of the coefficients of \\(a^2b^2\\) in P and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in Q, because \\(c^0\\) would leave the term as a constant, but no, that's not necessarily the case. Because the problem doesn't specify any restriction on the power of c, so we have to consider all possible powers. \n\nWait, no, the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of c. So, in the product, each term will be of the form \\(a^kb^{4 - k}c^m\\), where m can be any integer from -6 to 6, depending on the expansion. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of m, the coefficient would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in P times the sum of all coefficients in Q, because each term in Q is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). \n\nYes, that seems correct. So, 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I can approach it by considering the entire expansion. Let me try that. \n\nThe expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nFirst, expand \\((a + b)^4\\) as we did before: \\(a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). \n\nThen, expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem, this would be \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). \n\nSo, the expansion of the second part is \\(\\dbinom{6}{0}c^6 + \\dbinom{6}{1}c^4 + \\dbinom{6}{2}c^2 + \\dbinom{6}{3}c^0 + \\dbinom{6}{4}c^{-2} + \\dbinom{6}{5}c^{-4} + \\dbinom{6}{6}c^{-6}\\). \n\nCalculating the coefficients: \n\n- \\(\\dbinom{6}{0} = 1\\), so the first term is \\(1c^6\\).\n- \\(\\dbinom{6}{1} = 6\\), so the second term is \\(6c^4\\).\n- \\(\\dbinom{6}{2} = 15\\), so the third term is \\(15c^2\\).\n- \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\), so the fourth term is \\(20c^0 = 20\\).\n- \\(\\dbinom{6}{4} = 15\\), so the fifth term is \\(15c^{-2}\\).\n- \\(\\dbinom{6}{5} = 6\\), so the sixth term is \\(6c^{-4}\\).\n- \\(\\dbinom{6}{6} = 1\\), so the seventh term is \\(1c^{-6}\\).\n\nSo, the expansion is \\(c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15c^{-2} + 6c^{-4} + c^{-6}\\).\n\nNow, when we multiply this by \\((a + b)^4\\), each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by each term in the second expansion, but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), we need to sum up all the coefficients from the second expansion because each term in the second expansion will multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. \n\nWait, no, that's not quite right. Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, you get terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), etc. But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not considering the \\(c\\) terms. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part. \n\nWait, but in the product, each term from the first part is multiplied by each term from the second part. So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), I need to consider all the terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any term from the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is equal to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part. \n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6, and the sum of all coefficients in the second part is 64, as calculated earlier by substituting \\(c = 1\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). \n\nWait, but let me check this another way. Let's consider that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is equal to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because \\(c^0\\) is the term that doesn't affect the variables, so it's like multiplying by 1. But in this case, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part is 20. So, if I do 6 * 20, that's 120. But that contradicts my earlier result of 384. \n\nHmm, so now I'm confused. Which approach is correct? \n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me re-read it. It says, \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is independent of \\(c\\), so in the product, each term will have some combination of \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\). But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in other words, we're looking for all terms in the expansion where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2 and 2, respectively, and the exponent of \\(c\\) can be anything. \n\nTherefore, the coefficient would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part, because each term in the second part is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). \n\nWait, but in that case, the coefficient would be 6 * 64 = 384, as I originally thought. \n\nBut then why did I get 120 when I considered only the \\(c^0\\) term? Because if I only consider the \\(c^0\\) term, I'm restricting the coefficient to only the term where \\(c\\) is not present, but the problem doesn't specify that. It just asks for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\). So, I think the correct approach is to multiply the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part by the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which is 64, giving 384. \n\nAlternatively, let's think of it as the product of two independent polynomials. The first polynomial is in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the second is in \\(c\\). When you multiply them, the variables are independent, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial and the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial. \n\nYes, that makes sense. So, 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of it as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6, and since the second part is multiplied as a whole, the coefficient gets scaled by the entire second polynomial. But that's not quite accurate because the second polynomial is being multiplied term by term. \n\nWait, perhaps another way to look at it is that the entire expression is a product of two polynomials, one in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and one in \\(c\\). So, when you multiply them, the coefficients of terms in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are scaled by the entire second polynomial. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the entire second polynomial. But since we're only interested in the coefficient, regardless of \\(c\\), we can consider that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 64. \n\nYes, that seems consistent. So, 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nWait, but let me try another approach. Let's consider that the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). If I expand this, each term will be of the form \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}a^{4 - k}b^k \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I need to find all terms where \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\), which gives \\(k = 2\\), and \\(m\\) can be any value from 0 to 6. \n\nSo, the coefficient would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} \\times \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m}\\). \n\nCalculating that, \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\), and \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nYes, that's consistent with my earlier reasoning. So, I think 384 is the correct answer. \n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me calculate the sum of the coefficients in the second polynomial again. The second polynomial is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The sum of coefficients is found by substituting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, that's correct. \n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nI think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning now.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 64. Multiplying these gives \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\boxed{384}."

    "text": " \n\nThe problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which means I need to find the term where \\(a\\) is squared and \\(b\\) is squared in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\). Let me write that out. \n\nSo, \\((a + b)^4\\) would expand to \\(\\dbinom{4}{0}a^4b^0 + \\dbinom{4}{1}a^3b^1 + \\dbinom{4}{2}a^2b^2 + \\dbinom{4}{3}a^1b^3 + \\dbinom{4}{4}a^0b^4\\). \n\nLooking at this, the term with \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}a^2b^2\\). I remember that \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) is calculated as \\(\\dfrac{4!}{2!2!}\\), which is \\(\\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient here is 6. \n\nWait, but the original expression isn't just \\((a + b)^4\\); it's multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I need to consider that as well. Hmm, does that affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)? \n\nLet me think. The expression is a product of two separate expansions: one involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the other involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). Since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), maybe I don't need to worry about the \\(c\\) terms because they won't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms when multiplying. \n\nWait, that might not be entirely accurate. When you multiply two expressions, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression. So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I need to consider how it's affected by the entire product. \n\nBut hold on, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is only from the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), right? Because the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), doesn't have any \\(a\\) or \\(b\\) terms. So, when I multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by any term from the second expansion, it's just \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by some constant. \n\nWait, but actually, no. Because the second part is multiplied by the entire expansion of the first part. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the overall product would just be the coefficient from the first part times the entire expansion of the second part. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), the \\(c\\) terms will just be constants when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). \n\nBut actually, no, because \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term from the first expansion, and when you multiply it by any term from the second expansion, which is in terms of \\(c\\), it will create terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2c^{-k}\\). But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, does that mean we're considering all possible coefficients from the second expansion and multiplying by the coefficient from the first expansion? \n\nWait, no, I think I'm overcomplicating this. Since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), it's actually the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion and the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, each term will contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times some power of \\(c\\). But since the problem doesn't specify anything about \\(c\\), it's just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would be the coefficient from the first part times the sum of the coefficients from the second part. \n\nWait, but that doesn't seem right either. Because if you have two separate variables, \\(a, b\\) and \\(c\\), then the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are independent of \\(c\\). So, when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, for the term \\(a^2b^2\\), it would be multiplied by every term in the second expansion, each of which is a power of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would actually be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. \n\nWait, but that might not be the case. Because if you're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then yes, it would be the coefficient from the first expansion times the entire expansion of the second part. But if the problem was asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some specific \\(k\\), then it would be different. But since it's just \\(a^2b^2\\), I think it's considering all possible powers of \\(c\\), so the coefficient would be the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all coefficients from the second part. \n\nBut wait, let me think again. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when you expand this, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, which are of the form \\(c^k\\) where \\(k\\) ranges from -6 to 6 in steps of 2, I think. \n\nBut the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, does that mean we're looking for all terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any power of \\(c\\), and we need the sum of all those coefficients? Or is it just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, and the second part doesn't affect it because it's multiplied by \\(c\\) terms? \n\nWait, no. The way the problem is phrased, it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so it's considering the entire product. So, each term in the product will be of the form \\(a^k b^m c^n\\), where \\(k + m = 4\\) and \\(n\\) ranges from -6 to 6 in steps of 2, I think. But the problem is only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, that would mean that we're looking for the sum of all coefficients where \\(k = 2\\) and \\(m = 2\\), multiplied by any power of \\(c\\). \n\nBut actually, no, because \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term from the first expansion, and when you multiply it by each term from the second expansion, you get terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. Because each term in the second expansion is a coefficient times a power of \\(c\\), and when you multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), you get \\(a^2b^2\\) times that coefficient times \\(c^k\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) across all possible \\(c^k\\) terms would be the coefficient from the first part times the sum of the coefficients from the second part. \n\nWait, but the second part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion would be found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion is 64. \n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 (from the first expansion) times 64 (sum of coefficients from the second expansion), which is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nWait, but that seems too straightforward. Let me double-check. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, if you think about it, each term in the product will be of the form \\(a^k b^{4 - k} c^m\\), where \\(k\\) ranges from 0 to 4 and \\(m\\) ranges from -6 to 6 in steps of 2. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, so the coefficient would be 6 (from \\(a^2b^2\\)) multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. But since the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), it's equivalent to 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. \n\nAnd as I thought earlier, the sum of coefficients in the second expansion is when \\(c = 1\\), so \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nBut wait, another way to think about it is that when you multiply two expressions, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each expression. But in this case, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is only in the first expression, and the second expression doesn't have any \\(a\\) or \\(b\\) terms. So, when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expression, each term in the second expression is a coefficient times a power of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expression multiplied by the entire second expression. \n\nBut that doesn't make sense because the second expression is a polynomial in \\(c\\), not a scalar. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expression times the entire second expression. But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. \n\nWait, maybe I'm getting confused here. Let me clarify. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product. So, in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term is of the form \\(a^k b^{4 - k} c^m\\), where \\(k\\) is from 0 to 4 and \\(m\\) is from -6 to 6 in steps of 2. \n\nSo, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be present when \\(k = 2\\), which gives \\(a^2b^2\\), and \\(m\\) can be any value from -6 to 6 in steps of 2. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the sum over all \\(m\\) of the coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by the coefficient from the first expansion. \n\nBut since the coefficient from the first expansion is 6 (as we calculated earlier), and the coefficients from the second expansion for each \\(m\\) are the binomial coefficients. So, the total coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nWait, but let me think again. The second expansion is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The sum of its coefficients is when \\(c = 1\\), which is 64. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nAlternatively, if I think about the entire product, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and the entire second part, but that doesn't make sense because the second part isn't a scalar. So, actually, I think the correct approach is that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients from the second part, which is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nWait, but let me check this another way. Let's expand both expressions separately and then see how the coefficients combine. \n\nFirst, \\((a + b)^4\\) expands to \\(a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). \n\nSecond, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) expands to \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). \n\nSo, when we multiply these two, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, resulting in terms like \\(6a^2b^2 \\times \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). \n\nBut the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, that would mean we're summing over all \\(k\\) from 0 to 6, the coefficients \\(6 \\times \\dbinom{6}{k}\\). \n\nWait, but that's not correct because each term is \\(6a^2b^2 \\times \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is \\(6 \\times \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k}\\). \n\nBut \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). \n\nWait, but let me make sure. If I have \\((a + b)^4\\) times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), then the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which means the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion. \n\nYes, that makes sense. Because when you multiply a term by a polynomial, the coefficient of that term in the product is the original coefficient multiplied by the sum of the coefficients of the polynomial. \n\nSo, the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is when \\(c = 1\\), which is \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). \n\nWait, but let me think again. Suppose I didn't consider the sum of coefficients. Suppose I just took the coefficient from the first part and thought that's the answer. Then I would have 6. But that seems too low because the second part is a degree 6 polynomial, so when you multiply, the coefficients should be larger. \n\nAlternatively, if I thought that the second part doesn't affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is not the case because each term in the second part is a coefficient that gets multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient from the first part times the entire second expansion, but since the second expansion has multiple terms, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the sum of all those products. \n\nWait, no, that's not quite right. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient from the first part times the sum of the coefficients from the second part. Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, each term contributes its coefficient to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times a power of \\(c\\). But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), it's the sum of all those contributions. \n\nSo, the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion is 64, so the total coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nAlternatively, if I consider that the second expansion is a generating function, then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the product of the coefficient from the first expansion and the sum of the coefficients from the second expansion. \n\nYes, I think that's correct. So, the final answer should be 384. \n\nWait, but let me check with a smaller example to make sure. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, \\((a + b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2\\). \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^1 = c + 1/c\\). \n\nMultiplying these together, the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) would be 1 (from \\(a^2\\)) times (1 + 1) = 2. Similarly, the coefficient of \\(ab\\) would be 2 times (1 + 1) = 4, and the coefficient of \\(b^2\\) would be 1 times (1 + 1) = 2. \n\nWait, but in this case, the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) in the product is 1 * (1 + 1) = 2, which is correct because the product is \\(a^2c + a^2/c + 2abc + 2ab/c + b^2c + b^2/c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2c\\) is 1, \\(a^2/c\\) is 1, and so on. But if we're just looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), it's 1 + 1 = 2, which matches 1 * (1 + 1) = 2. \n\nSo, applying that logic to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 * (sum of coefficients in the second expansion) = 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nTherefore, I think that's the correct answer. \n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{384}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem.\n\nFirst, we expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n\\]\nThe term with \\(a^2b^2\\) is:\n\\[\n\\dbinom{4}{2}a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\n\\]\nSo, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\nNext, we consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The sum of the coefficients in this expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\):\n\\[\n\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\n\\]\n\nWhen multiplying the two expansions, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient from the first expansion multiplied by the sum of the coefficients from the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is:\n\\[\n6 \\times 64 = 384\n\\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{384}."

    "text": " \n\nThe problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) specifically. That means I need to look at the term where the power of \\(a\\) is 2 and the power of \\(b\\) is 2 in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\). Let me write that out.\n\nSo, for \\((a + b)^4\\), using the binomial theorem, the general term is \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\\). I need the term where \\(a^2b^2\\), so that would be when \\(4 - k = 2\\) for \\(a\\) and \\(k = 2\\) for \\(b\\). Let me check: if \\(4 - k = 2\\), then \\(k = 2\\). So, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\).\n\nCalculating that, \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. \n\nBut wait, the original expression isn't just \\((a + b)^4\\); it's multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I think I need to consider how this multiplication affects the coefficient. \n\nHmm, okay, so when you multiply two expressions, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and the second expression is in terms of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), which don't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), I think the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product will just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nWait, no, that's not quite right. Because when you multiply two polynomials, each term from the first polynomial is multiplied by each term from the second polynomial. However, since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), the terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) will just contribute a factor that doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) coefficients. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but since we're only interested in the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\), the other terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) will just be constants when considering the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. \n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think again. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the \\((a + b)^4\\) part, because the other part doesn't have \\(a\\) or \\(b\\). So, when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first part will be multiplied by every term in the second part. However, since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, and \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient will actually be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't make sense because the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is a sum of terms with different powers of \\(c\\), so when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each of those, you'd get terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), etc. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is the term where the power of \\(a\\) is 2, \\(b\\) is 2, and \\(c\\) is 0. But wait, in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), is there a term with \\(c^0\\)? Because if there is, then multiplying that term by \\(a^2b^2\\) would give a term with \\(a^2b^2\\). \n\nSo, maybe I should first find the constant term (the term with \\(c^0\\)) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Then, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 (from the first part) multiplied by that constant term. \n\nLet me verify that. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\), and if I multiply it by the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), then the resulting term will be \\(a^2b^2\\) times that constant, which would be the coefficient we're looking for. If there's no constant term, then the coefficient would be zero. So, I need to check if \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) has a constant term, and if so, what its coefficient is. \n\nTo find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), I can use the binomial theorem again. The expansion is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, the exponent of \\(c\\) in each term is \\(6 - 2k\\). I need the term where the exponent is zero, because that's the constant term. So, set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\). \n\nSo, the constant term is when \\(k = 3\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} c^{0} = \\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). \n\nWait, that calculation doesn't seem right. Let me compute \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\) again. \\(6! = 720\\), \\(3! = 6\\), so \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). Yeah, that's correct. So, the constant term is 20. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, multiplied by the constant term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20. So, 6 times 20 is 120. \n\nWait, let me make sure I didn't miss anything. So, in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. In the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the constant term is 20. When you multiply these two expansions together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part gets multiplied by the constant term 20 from the second part, resulting in \\(20a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 20 times 6, which is 120. \n\nIs there any other way this could be approached? Maybe by considering the entire expansion, but that seems more complicated. Alternatively, since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are only in the first part, and \\(c\\) is only in the second, their coefficients are independent. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just the product of the coefficients from each part. \n\nWait, but actually, no, because when you multiply two polynomials, each term from the first is multiplied by each term from the second. However, since we're only interested in the terms where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2 and 2 respectively, and the exponents of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) are zero, the only term that contributes is when we take \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part and the constant term from the second part. So, yes, the coefficient is 6 times 20, which is 120. \n\nLet me just recap to make sure I didn't make a mistake. \n\n1. Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n\n2. Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem to find the constant term (where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero). This occurs when \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), so \\(k = 3\\), and the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n\n3. Multiply the two coefficients together because the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part must be multiplied by the constant term from the second part to get the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. So, 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nThat seems correct. I don't think I missed any steps. So, the coefficient should be 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is found using the binomial coefficient \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). The constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying these gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{120}"

But that seems a bit confusing. Let me think again.\n\nActually, when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first polynomial gets multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. But since the variables \\(a, b\\) and \\(c\\) are independent, the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) will not interfere with the terms involving \\(c\\).

But since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which only involves \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the second expression involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), the multiplication will result in terms that have \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by some power of \\(c\\). \n\nBut the question is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, actually, in the entire product, every term that has \\(a^2b^2\\) will have some coefficient multiplied by a term involving \\(c\\). But since the problem doesn't specify any condition on \\(c\\), perhaps we're just supposed to consider the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) as being multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nWait, that seems a bit unclear. Let me think again. Maybe the question is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, but since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), perhaps the coefficient is just the same as in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nWait, no, that doesn't make sense either. Alternatively, perhaps the question is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without considering \\(c\\), meaning that the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), so the coefficient would be 6 times the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would make the coefficient a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't seem right because the question is asking for a numerical coefficient. \n\nHmm, maybe I need to clarify the problem. The problem says: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)\". So, perhaps it's considering the entire expression as a polynomial in \\(a, b, c\\), and we're to find the coefficient of the term \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). \n\nIn that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, no, that's not quite right. Let me think again. \n\nWhen you multiply two polynomials, the coefficients of the terms multiply. So, if I have a term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part with coefficient 6, and I multiply it by each term in the second part, which is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the second part has a coefficient and a power of \\(c\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will appear multiplied by each term in the second expansion, each with their own coefficient. \n\nBut since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), we need to sum all the coefficients from the second expansion and multiply that by 6. Because each term in the second expansion, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), will contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. \n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nNow, the sum of all coefficients in a polynomial is found by plugging in 1 for all variables. So, in this case, the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). \n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 multiplied by 64, which is 384. \n\nWait, but let me double-check that. So, the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is indeed \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, when you multiply by 6, you get 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nAlternatively, another way to think about it is that each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is of the form \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - k}\\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, each term has a coefficient \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}\\) and a power of \\(c\\). \n\nBut when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each of these terms, you get \\(a^2b^2 \\times \\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, the coefficient for each such term is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} \\times \\dbinom{6}{k}\\), which is 6 * \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}\\). \n\nBut since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), we need to sum over all possible \\(k\\) from 0 to 6. That is, the total coefficient is 6 * sum_{k=0}^6 \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}\\). \n\nBut the sum of \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}\\) from \\(k=0\\) to 6 is \\(2^6 = 64\\), so 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nWait, but hold on. Is that correct? Because when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in one polynomial is multiplied by all terms in the other polynomial, and the coefficients add up. So, in this case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, and when you multiply by each term in the second polynomial, each term's coefficient adds to the total coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). \n\nWait, no, actually, when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) with coefficient 6 is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial, each of which has its own coefficient. Therefore, the total contribution to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial. \n\nSince the sum of coefficients in the second polynomial is 64, the total coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nBut let me verify this with a simpler example to make sure I'm not making a mistake. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^1 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, \\((a + b)(c + 1/c)\\). Expanding this, we get \\(ac + a/c + bc + b/c\\). Now, the coefficient of \\(a\\) is \\(c + 1/c\\), but if we're considering the coefficient of \\(a\\) regardless of \\(c\\), we might need to sum over all coefficients. Wait, but in this case, the term \\(a\\) is multiplied by \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), so the coefficient would be \\(c + 1/c\\). But that's not a numerical coefficient; it's a polynomial in \\(c\\). \n\nWait, so perhaps my initial approach is incorrect. Maybe the problem is expecting a numerical coefficient, but since \\(c\\) is involved, it's actually a polynomial coefficient. So, perhaps the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which would make the coefficient a polynomial in \\(c\\). \n\nBut the problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", so perhaps it's just 6 times the expansion, but that seems odd. Alternatively, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating it as a single expression. \n\nIn that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because \\(a^2b^2\\) is being multiplied by each term in that expansion. Therefore, the coefficient is 6 multiplied by each term in the expansion, meaning the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\). \n\nBut the problem might be expecting a numerical coefficient, but since \\(c\\) is involved, it's more likely that the coefficient is a polynomial. However, the problem didn't specify any particular power of \\(c\\), so maybe it's just 6 times the sum of coefficients, which is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nWait, but in the expansion, the coefficients are \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}\\), so the total sum is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it, and the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable, so the coefficient would be 6 times the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 6*(c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15/c^2 + 6/c^4 + 1/c^6). \n\nBut that would make the coefficient a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't seem right because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. So, perhaps I need to clarify whether the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some \\(k\\), or just \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\). \n\nWait, the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so perhaps it's considering the entire expression as a polynomial in \\(a, b, c\\), and the term \\(a^2b^2\\) can be multiplied by any power of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial in \\(c\\). \n\nBut the problem didn't specify any particular power of \\(c\\), so perhaps the answer is just 6 times the sum of coefficients, which is 6*64=384. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm misapplying the concept. Let me think again. When you have two polynomials multiplied together, the coefficient of a specific term in one polynomial is the product of the coefficients of the terms that multiply to give that term. But in this case, since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial. \n\nYes, that makes sense. Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second polynomial, each term contributes its coefficient to the overall coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the total coefficient is 6 * (sum of coefficients in the second polynomial). \n\nThe sum of coefficients in the second polynomial is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), so \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nWait, but let me confirm this with a smaller example to make sure. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^1 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, the expansion is \\(ac + a/c + bc + b/c\\). The coefficient of \\(a\\) is \\(c + 1/c\\), which is the same as 1 times the sum of coefficients in the second polynomial, which is \\(1 + 1 = 2\\). But \\(c + 1/c\\) is not equal to 2. So, this suggests that my approach is incorrect. \n\nWait, so in this small example, the coefficient of \\(a\\) is \\(c + 1/c\\), which is not equal to 1 * 2. So, my initial reasoning was wrong. Therefore, perhaps the correct approach is different. \n\nSo, maybe I need to think differently. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. Since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term in the first polynomial, and the second polynomial is in terms of \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial multiplied by the entire second polynomial. \n\nTherefore, the coefficient is 6 * \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would make the coefficient a polynomial in \\(c\\), which seems to contradict the problem's wording, as it just asks for the coefficient, not a polynomial. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting a numerical coefficient, treating \\(c\\) as a variable, so the coefficient is 6 multiplied by each coefficient in the second expansion. But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, which doesn't make sense for a single coefficient. \n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Maybe the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, without considering \\(c\\). So, perhaps it's just 6, because the other part doesn't affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). But that doesn't seem right because when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficients do interact. \n\nWait, but in reality, when you have two independent variables, the coefficients multiply. So, for example, if you have \\((a + b)(c + d)\\), the coefficient of \\(a\\) is \\(c + d\\), and the coefficient of \\(b\\) is also \\(c + d\\). So, in that case, the coefficients are polynomials in the other variables. \n\nTherefore, in our original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since the problem is asking for the coefficient, perhaps it's expecting a numerical value, which would require knowing the value of \\(c\\). But since \\(c\\) is a variable, the coefficient is a polynomial. \n\nWait, but the problem didn't specify any particular power of \\(c\\), so maybe it's just asking for the coefficient as a polynomial. But the problem statement doesn't specify, so perhaps I need to clarify. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where \\(c\\) cancels out, i.e., \\(c^0\\). So, in that case, I would need to find the term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, and then multiply that by 6. \n\nThat makes sense because if we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), we might be looking for the term where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out, leaving \\(c^0\\). \n\nSo, let me try that approach. In \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0 is the constant term. To find that, we can use the binomial theorem. \n\nThe general term in the expansion is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - k}\\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\\). We need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be 0, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\). \n\nTherefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\), which is 20. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nWait, that seems plausible. So, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms, meaning \\(c^0\\), then the answer would be 120. \n\nBut let me confirm this approach. If the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), then we might need to consider all possible powers of \\(c\\), which would make the coefficient a polynomial. However, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it's 120. \n\nGiven that the problem didn't specify any power of \\(c\\), but just asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), it's ambiguous. However, in many problems, when they ask for the coefficient of a term without specifying other variables, they often mean the coefficient when considering all possible powers of the other variables. \n\nBut in this case, since \\(c\\) is a separate variable, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) can be multiplied by any power of \\(c\\), making the coefficient a polynomial. However, the problem might be expecting a numerical coefficient, so perhaps it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when multiplied by \\(c^0\\), which is 120. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is just expecting the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial, which is 6, and the second polynomial doesn't affect it because \\(c\\) is a separate variable. But that doesn't seem right because when you multiply polynomials, the coefficients do combine. \n\nWait, but in reality, when you have independent variables, the coefficients don't combine in that way. For example, in \\((a + b)(c + d)\\), the coefficient of \\(a\\) is \\(c + d\\), and the coefficient of \\(b\\) is also \\(c + d\\). So, in our problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial in \\(c\\). \n\nBut the problem is asking for the coefficient, which is a number, so perhaps it's expecting a numerical value. Therefore, maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to consider the entire expansion, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which would be a polynomial. But since the problem didn't specify, it's a bit unclear. \n\nWait, maybe I should look for similar problems or think about how such problems are usually structured. Typically, when a problem asks for the coefficient of a term in a product of two expressions, and the variables are independent, it's often the case that the coefficient is the product of the coefficients from each expression. But in this case, the first expression only has \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the second has \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), so they don't interfere with each other. \n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expression, which is 6, multiplied by the entire second expression. So, the coefficient is 6 * \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial. \n\nBut the problem is asking for the coefficient, which is a number, so perhaps it's expecting the coefficient when \\(c = 1\\), which would make the second expression equal to \\(2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient would be 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nAlternatively, if we consider that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), then it's 6 times the sum of coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nWait, but earlier I thought that approach was incorrect because in the small example, it didn't hold. Let me think again. In the small example, \\((a + b)(c + 1/c)\\), the coefficient of \\(a\\) is \\(c + 1/c\\), which is not equal to 1 * (sum of coefficients in the second polynomial). The sum of coefficients in the second polynomial is \\(1 + 1 = 2\\), but the coefficient of \\(a\\) is \\(c + 1/c\\), which is not equal to 2. So, that approach is incorrect. \n\nTherefore, my initial approach was wrong. So, perhaps the correct approach is that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial. \n\nBut the problem is asking for the coefficient, which is a number, so perhaps it's expecting a numerical value, which would require knowing the value of \\(c\\). Since \\(c\\) is a variable, the coefficient is a polynomial, not a number. Therefore, perhaps the problem is misworded, or I'm misunderstanding it. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating \\(c\\) as a constant. But that doesn't make sense because \\(c\\) is a variable. \n\nWait, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where \\(c\\) cancels out. In that case, as I calculated earlier, the coefficient would be 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, regardless of \\(c\\), which would mean summing over all coefficients from the second polynomial. But as I saw in the small example, that approach doesn't work because the coefficient becomes a polynomial, not a number. \n\nWait, maybe the problem is expecting the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) as a term in the product, which would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient is a polynomial, and the answer would be \\(6 \\times \\left(c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15/c^2 + 6/c^4 + 1/c^6\\right)\\). \n\nBut the problem is asking for the coefficient, which is a number, so perhaps it's expecting a numerical coefficient, which would require knowing the value of \\(c\\). Since \\(c\\) isn't specified, perhaps the problem is misworded, or I'm misunderstanding it. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is only considering the coefficients of the terms where \\(c\\) is raised to a specific power, but it's not specified. \n\nWait, perhaps I should look back at the problem statement again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, it's just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), without specifying anything about \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), and the answer is \\(6 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nBut the problem is presented as a math problem expecting a numerical answer, so perhaps it's expecting the coefficient when \\(c = 1\\), which would make the second polynomial equal to \\(2^6 = 64\\), so the coefficient would be 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is expecting the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. \n\nGiven that, I think the most plausible answer is 120, because if we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms, meaning \\(c^0\\), then it's 120. \n\nWait, but let me think again. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient is a polynomial, not a number. \n\nBut since the problem is asking for the coefficient, which is a number, perhaps it's expecting the sum of the coefficients, which is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nWait, but in the small example, that approach didn't work. So, perhaps the correct answer is 120, considering only the constant term. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is expecting the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable, so the coefficient is 6 times the expansion, which is a polynomial. But the problem is presented as expecting a numerical answer, so perhaps it's 120. \n\nI think I need to make a decision here. Given that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and not specifying \\(c\\), but given that \\(c\\) is a variable, the coefficient is a polynomial. However, since the problem is presented as expecting a numerical answer, perhaps it's expecting the coefficient when \\(c = 1\\), which would be 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nAlternatively, if it's expecting the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120, that's also a possibility. \n\nWait, perhaps I should calculate both and see which one makes sense. \n\nFirst, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nSecond, the sum of coefficients approach gives 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nBut in the small example, the coefficient of \\(a\\) is \\(c + 1/c\\), which is not 1 * 2, so the sum of coefficients approach is incorrect. Therefore, the correct approach is that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial. \n\nBut since the problem is expecting a numerical answer, perhaps it's a miscommunication, and the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), which would be 6 times the entire expansion, but that's a polynomial. \n\nWait, perhaps the problem is intended to consider only the terms where \\(c\\) cancels out, so the coefficient is 120. \n\nGiven that, I think the answer is 120. \n\nBut to be thorough, let me check the expansion. \n\nIn \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0 is when \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), so \\(k = 3\\). The coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, the term is \\(20c^0 = 20\\). \n\nTherefore, when we multiply this by \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first polynomial, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by 20 gives \\(20a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 20 * 6 = 120. \n\nWait, no, that's not correct. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial is 6, and when you multiply by the term 20 in the second polynomial, the coefficient becomes 6 * 20 = 120 for the term \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). \n\nBut the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), without specifying \\(c\\), so perhaps it's 120. \n\nAlternatively, if we consider that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the entire expansion of the second polynomial, which is a polynomial, then the coefficient is a polynomial, not a number. \n\nBut since the problem is expecting a numerical answer, I think the intended answer is 120, considering only the constant term in \\(c\\). \n\nTherefore, after all this thinking, I believe the coefficient is 120.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break it down into two parts:\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\):** Using the binomial theorem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n\n2. **Consider the second part \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):** We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0. Using the binomial theorem, this occurs when \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), so \\(k = 3\\). The coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n\n3. **Combine the coefficients:** Multiply the coefficients from both parts: \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer:** \\(\\boxed{120}\\)"

In the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\), the general term is \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\\). I want the term where \\(a\\) is squared and \\(b\\) is squared, so that means \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). So, plugging in \\(k = 2\\), the coefficient would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\).

Hmm, so does that mean I only need to consider the part of the product where the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms come from, and not worry about the \\(c\\) terms? Because \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), so when I multiply the two expressions, the \\(c\\) terms won't affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). \n\nLet me think again. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When I expand this, each term from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term from the second expansion. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), that means we only need to consider the term in the second expansion that is a constant (i.e., the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero). Because if we take any other term from the second expansion, it would have a \\(c\\) term, which would make the entire term have \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or something like that, but we don't care about that. So, to get the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), we need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) and then multiply it by the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which we found to be 6.\n\nSo, now I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let's apply the binomial theorem here as well. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying that, each term becomes \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\times c^{-m} = \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). \n\nWe want the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero because that's the constant term. So, set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Let me compute that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). So, the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20.\n\nNow, going back to the original expression, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the product of the coefficient from the first part and the constant term from the second part. That would be 6 (from \\((a + b)^4\\)) multiplied by 20 (from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)). So, 6 times 20 is 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120.\n\nWait a second, let me just double-check to make sure I didn't make a mistake. So, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6. Then, in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the constant term is when \\(m = 3\\), which gives \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying 6 and 20 gives 120. Hmm, that seems correct. I don't think I missed anything here. The key was realizing that the \\(c\\) terms don't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms, so I only needed the constant term from the second expansion. Yeah, I think that's solid.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the coefficient is 120. I don't think there's any other term that would contribute to \\(a^2b^2\\) because any term involving \\(c\\) would have a different power, and since we're only looking for \\(a^2b^2\\), the rest would involve \\(c\\) terms which we don't want. So, yeah, 120 is the answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break down the problem into two parts using the binomial theorem.\n\nFirst, consider the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\). Using the binomial theorem, the general term is given by:\n\\[\n\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n\\]\nWe need the term where the powers of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2. This occurs when \\(k = 2\\), so the coefficient is:\n\\[\n\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\n\\]\n\nNext, consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem, the general term is given by:\n\\[\n\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n\\]\nWe need the constant term, which occurs when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. Setting \\(6 - 2m = 0\\) gives \\(m = 3\\). The coefficient is:\n\\[\n\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\n\\]\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficients from the two expansions:\n\\[\n6 \\times 20 = 120\n\\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}."

If I expand this, each term will be of the form \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\\) where \\(k\\) goes from 0 to 4. So, to get the term \\(a^2b^2\\), I need \\(4 - k = 2\\) for \\(a\\) and \\(k = 2\\) for \\(b\\). That means when \\(k = 2\\), the term will be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} a^{2}b^{2}\\). \n\nLet me calculate \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). I know that \\(\\dbinom{n}{k} = \\dfrac{n!}{k!(n - k)!}\\), so plugging in 4 and 2, that's \\(\\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), is 6.\n\nNow, the second part of the expression is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I need to figure out what the coefficient is here, but wait, the problem is only asking about the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Hmm, so does the second part affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)? Let me think. \n\nWhen I multiply two expressions together, the coefficients multiply as well. So, if I have \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since the problem is only asking about \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), maybe I just need to find the coefficient of the term that, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), doesn't change the \\(a^2b^2\\) part. \n\nWait, that might not make sense. Let me clarify. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), and it's multiplied by every term from the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the entire expression will have terms like \\(6a^2b^2 \\times \\text{(terms from the second expansion)}\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Hmm, but if it's multiplied by other terms involving \\(c\\), then \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by various powers of \\(c\\). So, unless there's a term in the second expansion that is a constant (i.e., \\(c^0\\)), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually be the sum of all the coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by 6. But wait, no, that's not quite right.\n\nWait, no, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't make sense because then the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\), not a single number.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, perhaps the problem is just treating the entire expression as a polynomial in \\(a, b, c\\), and it's asking for the coefficient of the term where \\(a\\) is squared, \\(b\\) is squared, and the exponents of \\(c\\) can be anything. But that still seems a bit unclear.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\), which is 1. So, in that case, I would need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and then multiply it by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nYes, that makes more sense. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, now I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), I can again use the binomial theorem. The expansion is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k\\). Simplifying each term, that's \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} c^{-k} = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). \n\nWe want the exponent of \\(c\\) to be 0, so we set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). \n\nCalculating \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\): \\(\\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20.\n\nNow, going back to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficient from the first part and the coefficient from the second part. So, that's \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nWait, let me just double-check that I didn't make a mistake in my calculations. For the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). For the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term where the exponents cancel out (i.e., \\(c^0\\)) occurs when \\(k = 3\\), and \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, multiplying 6 and 20 gives 120. \n\nI think that's correct. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is found by multiplying the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nFor \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n\nFor \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n\nMultiplying these together: \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\(\\boxed{120}\\)"

That means I need to find the term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2. Let me write that down. \n\nSo, for \\((a + b)^4\\), the general term is \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\\). I want the term where \\(a^2b^2\\), so I can set up the exponents: \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). Let me solve for \\(k\\). \n\nIf \\(4 - k = 2\\), then \\(k = 2\\). So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). Okay, so the coefficient from the \\((a + b)^4\\) part is 6. \n\nNow, the expression also has \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I'm not sure if this part affects the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), because \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) are different variables from \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). Wait, but the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so maybe I don't need to consider the \\(c\\) terms at all? Hmm, that seems a bit confusing. \n\nWait, no, actually, when you multiply two expressions together, each term from the first expression gets multiplied by each term from the second expression. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), that means we only need the constant term (the term with \\(c^0\\)) from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because if we take any other term involving \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), then when we multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), the resulting term will have those \\(c\\) terms, which are not part of \\(a^2b^2\\). \n\nSo, to clarify, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 times the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Therefore, I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nAlright, let's work on that. Again, using the binomial theorem, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying the exponents, that becomes \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m - m} = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\).\n\nWe want the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, because that's the constant term. So, set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). Wait, no, that's not right. Let me correct that. \n\nWait, 6! is 720, 3! is 6, so 720 divided by (6 * 6) is 720 / 36, which is indeed 20. So, the constant term is 20. \n\nSo, going back, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (the constant term from the second part), which is 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't miss anything. So, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4\\) times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). When I expand both, each term in the first expansion gets multiplied by each term in the second. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), we only need the part of the second expansion that's multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), which is the constant term (the term with \\(c^0\\)). \n\nTherefore, the coefficient is indeed 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nWait, but let me double-check the calculations. For the binomial coefficients, \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) is 6, correct. \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\) is 20, correct. So, 6 * 20 is 120. Hmm, that seems right. \n\nIs there another way to think about this? Maybe by considering the entire expansion, but that might be more complicated. Alternatively, perhaps I can think of it as the product of two independent binomial expansions, so the coefficients multiply when taking terms with the same variables. \n\nYes, that makes sense. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part is 20, so when you multiply them, you get 120. \n\nI think that's correct.
