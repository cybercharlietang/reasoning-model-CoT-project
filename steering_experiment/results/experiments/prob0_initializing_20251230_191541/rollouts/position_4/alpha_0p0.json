    "text": " \n\nLet me start with the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\). Using the binomial theorem, this expansion would have terms from \\(a^4\\) down to \\(b^4\\). Each term is of the form \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\\) where \\(k\\) goes from 0 to 4. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in this part would be when \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\), right? So, plugging in \\(k = 2\\), the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). \n\nCalculating that, \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. \n\nBut wait, the problem isn't just \\((a + b)^4\\); it's multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I need to consider how this multiplication affects the coefficient. I think I need to expand the second part as well and see how it interacts with the first part. \n\nLet me look at \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Again, using the binomial theorem, this would be \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying that, each term becomes \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, each term is a coefficient times \\(c\\) raised to some power.\n\nNow, since the entire expression is the product of \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part, because when you multiply by something, each term in the first polynomial gets multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. But wait, hold on, no, actually, that's not quite right because we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\). So, maybe I don't need to consider the \\(c\\) terms when looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). \n\nWait, no, that's not correct either. Because when you multiply two polynomials, each term from the first polynomial gets multiplied by each term from the second polynomial. So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I need to find all the ways that when I multiply a term from \\((a + b)^4\\) and a term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the result has \\(a^2b^2\\). But since \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) are separate variables, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the product would just be the product of the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part and any term from the second part, right? Because the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms don't interact with the \\(c\\) terms. \n\nWait, but that can't be right because if I'm only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), then the \\(c\\) terms would just be coefficients multiplied by \\(c\\) raised to some power, but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, maybe the coefficient would be the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all coefficients from the second part. \n\nWait, no, that's not correct either. Because when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in one polynomial is multiplied by all terms in the other polynomial, but if you're looking for a specific term in the product, like \\(a^2b^2\\), then it's just the product of the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part and the entire second part. But actually, no, because the second part is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is a separate variable. So, when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the result is a product where each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part would be multiplied by each term in the second part, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) where \\(k\\) varies. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would only consider the terms where the power of \\(c\\) is zero, right? Because \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term without any \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\). \n\nWait, that makes sense. So, I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by \\(c^0\\), you get \\(a^2b^2\\). If you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by \\(c^k\\), you get \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), which isn't the term we're interested in. So, the coefficient we're looking for is the product of the coefficients from each part where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2 and 2, respectively, and the exponents of \\(c\\) are 0. \n\nSo, let's break it down. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, as I found earlier. Now, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). \n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), I can use the binomial theorem again. The general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(1/c\\right)^m = \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We want the exponent of \\(c\\) to be 0, so we set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which gives \\(m = 3\\). \n\nSo, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). \n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 20. \n\nNow, the overall coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is the product of the two coefficients we found: 6 (from \\(a^2b^2\\)) and 20 (from \\(c^0\\)). \n\nSo, 6 multiplied by 20 is 120. \n\nWait, let me just make sure I didn't make any mistakes here. So, in the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6 because \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). \n\nIn the second part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term with \\(c^0\\) is when the exponent is 0, which occurs at \\(m = 3\\), so \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). \n\nSo, multiplying these together, 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nYes, that seems correct. I don't think I missed anything here. The key was realizing that when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each polynomial, provided their exponents add up appropriately. In this case, since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), we needed the term in the second polynomial that doesn't involve \\(c\\) either, which is the constant term \\(c^0\\). \n\nSo, putting it all together, the coefficient is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Multiplying these together gives 6 * 20 = 120.\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\boxed{120}."

    "text": " \n\nIn this case, the expression is \\((a + b)^4\\). So, applying the binomial theorem, this would expand to \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\\). I'm looking for the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2, so that would be \\(a^2b^2\\). To find the coefficient of this term, I need to find the value of \\(k\\) such that \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). So, \\(k = 2\\).\n\nSo, the coefficient from the \\((a + b)^4\\) part is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Let me calculate that: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). Okay, so the coefficient from the first part is 6.\n\nNow, the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I need to figure out how this affects the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, actually, no. Wait a second, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression. But the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when we multiply these two expressions together, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nBut the question is only asking about the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). That term doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), right? Because \\(a^2b^2\\) is just a term with \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). So, when we multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part will be multiplied by every term in the second part. However, since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I think we need to consider how the multiplication affects this term. Wait, but actually, no, because when you multiply two polynomials, each term from the first polynomial is multiplied by each term from the second, so the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), etc. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is just the term without any \\(c\\)s. Wait, but that term doesn't exist because when you multiply by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), you can't get a term without \\(c\\) unless you multiply by the constant term in that expansion.\n\nWait, but \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) doesn't have a constant term because all the exponents of \\(c\\) will be even numbers from 6 down to -6, stepping by 2 each time. So, the only way to get a constant term (i.e., \\(c^0\\)) would be if we have a term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. So, in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the constant term would be the term where the exponent is zero. Let me check that.\n\nUsing the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, to find the constant term, we set the exponent equal to zero: \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which gives \\(m = 3\\). So, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} c^{0} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20.\n\nTherefore, when we multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by 20 from the second part, resulting in \\(20a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 20.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake here. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\) with coefficient 6, and then it's multiplied by the constant term 20 from the other expansion. So, 6 * 20 = 120. Wait, that doesn't seem right because I thought the coefficient was 6 from the first part and 20 from the second, so together it's 6 * 20 = 120. But earlier I thought the coefficient was 20, which was wrong.\n\nWait, no, wait. Let me think again. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6a^2b^2. Then, when you multiply by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term 6a^2b^2 will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would only include the terms where the product results in \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by 1 (i.e., the constant term). Because if you multiply by any other term, like \\(c^k\\) or \\(c^{-k}\\), you'll get terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2c^{-k}\\), which are not \\(a^2b^2\\). So, only the constant term in the second expansion will contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the final product.\n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (the constant term from the second part), which is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but that seems high. Let me check my steps again. First, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Then, in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the constant term is when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, which occurs at \\(m = 3\\), so \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, when you multiply these two, the coefficient becomes 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but let me consider the entire expression: \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when you expand this, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by every term in the second expansion, but only the constant term (20) will result in a term that is \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms. All other terms would have \\(c\\) raised to some power, so they wouldn't contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient is indeed 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because sometimes when you have products of polynomials, the coefficients can combine in different ways, but in this case, since we're only interested in \\(a^2b^2\\), and the second polynomial doesn't affect \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), only \\(c\\), then the coefficient should just be the product of the coefficients from each part.\n\nSo, yes, I think the correct coefficient is 120.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't miss anything. Let me write out the expansions more explicitly.\n\nFirst, \\((a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\).\n\nThen, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15c^{-2} + 6c^{-4} + c^{-6}\\).\n\nNow, when we multiply these two expansions together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first polynomial will be multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. So, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, resulting in:\n\n\\(6a^2b^2c^6 + 36a^2b^2c^4 + 90a^2b^2c^2 + 120a^2b^2 + 90a^2b^2c^{-2} + 36a^2b^2c^{-4} + 6a^2b^2c^{-6}\\).\n\nSo, in the entire product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) appears only once, multiplied by the constant term 20 from the second expansion, resulting in \\(120a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient is indeed 120.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was 20, but that was a mistake because I didn't consider that the 6 from the first part also multiplies into it. So, 6 * 20 = 120 is correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of it as the coefficient being the product of the coefficients from each part because the variables \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are independent of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So, I think the answer is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Multiplying these gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\boxed{120}"

I'm looking for the term where \\(a^2b^2\\), so that means \\(4 - k = 2\\) for \\(a\\), which would make \\(k = 2\\) for \\(b\\). So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in this part should be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Let me calculate that: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\nNow, the other part of the expression is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I'm supposed to multiply this by \\((a + b)^4\\), so the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Does that mean I don't need to consider the \\(c\\) terms? Hmm, maybe not, because \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\). So, perhaps the coefficient is just 6 times whatever the constant term is in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because when I multiply the two expressions, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will be multiplied by every term in the second expansion, but since I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I might just need the constant term from the second part, so that when I multiply, I don't introduce any \\(c\\) terms that would change the degree of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\).\n\nWait, no, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think again. The problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product of the two expressions. So, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by every term in the second part. But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, I think that the \\(c\\) terms don't affect the \\(a^2b^2\\) term because they are separate variables. So, perhaps the coefficient is just the coefficient from the first part, 6, multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part, but that doesn't make sense because the second part is in terms of \\(c\\), not \\(a\\) or \\(b\\). \n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, perhaps the \\(c\\) terms are just part of the overall expression, but since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient would just be 6 times whatever the constant term is in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because when you multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), the only term that contributes to \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms is the constant term in the second expansion.\n\nSo, let me check that. If I have \\((a + b)^4\\) times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), then the expansion would have terms like \\(a^2b^2 \\times c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2 \\times 6c^5\\), etc., but the only term that would contribute to \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) is when the second part is 1, i.e., when \\(c^0\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nSo, I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let's expand that using the binomial theorem. The general term in the expansion is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We want the exponent of \\(c\\) to be 0, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\).\n\nSo, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Let me compute that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). Wait, that doesn't seem right because \\(6! = 720\\), but \\(3! = 6\\), so \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = 20\\). Hmm, actually, that's correct because \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\) is 20.\n\nSo, the constant term is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the second part), which is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nWait, let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\) with coefficient 6, and in the second part, the constant term is 20, so when you multiply these together, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 * 20 = 120. That seems right.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should think about the entire expansion. Let me consider that \\((a + b)^4\\) gives terms up to \\(a^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) gives terms involving \\(c^6\\) down to \\(c^{-6}\\). But when I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), so actually, the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but that can't be right because that would give a polynomial in \\(c\\), but the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term in the product, but without considering \\(c\\). Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm wrong in assuming that the coefficient is 6 times the constant term. Let me think again. When you have two polynomials multiplied together, the coefficient of a specific term in one part is multiplied by all the terms in the other part. But in this case, since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), it's only the part where the \\(c\\) terms cancel out, i.e., the constant term in the second polynomial. So, the coefficient would be 6 times 20, which is 120.\n\nWait, but let me check with an example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). And \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) would expand to terms like \\(c^6 + 6c^5 + 15c^4 + 20c^3 + 15c^2 + 6c + 1 + 6/c + 15/c^2 + 20/c^3 + 15/c^4 + 6/c^5 + 1/c^6\\). So, when I multiply these two, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part would be multiplied by each term in the second part, resulting in terms like \\(6a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(6a^2b^2c^5\\), etc., up to \\(6a^2b^2/c^6\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would only be the term where the power of \\(c\\) is zero, i.e., when multiplied by 1. So, that term is \\(6 \\times 20 a^2b^2\\), because the constant term is 20, so the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120. So, yes, that makes sense.\n\nWait, but another thought: if the problem had asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^3\\), then it would be 6 * 20 (since the \\(c^3\\) term in the second part is 20), but in this case, since it's just \\(a^2b^2\\), we're only considering the term where the \\(c\\) part is 1, so the constant term. Therefore, the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but let me make sure that I didn't make a mistake in calculating the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). The general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\times (1/c)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, setting the exponent to zero: 6 - 2k = 0 \u21d2 k = 3. So, the term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). That's correct.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 (from the first expansion) multiplied by 20 (from the constant term in the second expansion), giving 120. Therefore, the final answer should be 120.\n\nWait, but just to be thorough, let me consider another approach. Since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), perhaps I can treat the entire expression as a product of two independent expansions and find the coefficient accordingly. So, \\((a + b)^4\\) has the term \\(a^2b^2\\) with coefficient 6, and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is being multiplied by it. Since \\(c\\) is a separate variable, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would mean that the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), but the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), not involving \\(c\\). So, the only way \\(a^2b^2\\) can exist in the product without any \\(c\\) terms is when it's multiplied by the constant term in the second expansion, which is 20. Therefore, the coefficient is indeed 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nI think that's solid. So, the coefficient is 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem for both parts of the expression.\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\), so the coefficient is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\n   \\]\n\n2. **Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n   \\]\n   The constant term (where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0) occurs when \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\). The coefficient is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\n   \\]\n\n3. **Combine the results:**\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficients from the two expansions:\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 20 = 120\n   \\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

    "text": " \n\nThe first part of the expression is \\((a + b)^4\\). Let me expand that. According to the binomial theorem, each term in the expansion will be \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\\) where \\(k\\) goes from 0 to 4. So, the expansion would be:\n\n\\[\n\\dbinom{4}{0}a^4b^0 + \\dbinom{4}{1}a^3b^1 + \\dbinom{4}{2}a^2b^2 + \\dbinom{4}{3}a^1b^3 + \\dbinom{4}{4}a^0b^4\n\\]\n\nCalculating the coefficients, that's:\n\n\\[\n1 \\cdot a^4 + 4 \\cdot a^3b + 6 \\cdot a^2b^2 + 4 \\cdot ab^3 + 1 \\cdot b^4\n\\]\n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6. Okay, that's straightforward.\n\nNow, the entire expression is this expansion multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Hmm, so I need to consider how this multiplication affects the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and the rest of the expression involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), which are different variables, I think the terms involving \\(c\\) won't affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, no, that's not quite right. Actually, the entire expression is a product of two expansions. So, when I multiply them together, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part will get multiplied by every term from the second part. However, since the problem only asks for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term without \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), I think we need to find the term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) that results in \\(c^0\\) because when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), it will still be \\(a^2b^2\\). \n\nSo, let me focus on expanding \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Again, using the binomial theorem, this will be:\n\n\\[\n\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n\\]\n\nSo, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). Now, I need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be zero because I want the term that, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), doesn't change the variables. So, set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\):\n\n\\[\n6 - 2m = 0 \\implies 2m = 6 \\implies m = 3\n\\]\n\nSo, the term where \\(m = 3\\) will give me \\(c^0\\), which is 1. The coefficient for this term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient from the second part is 20.\n\nNow, since the original expression is the product of the two expansions, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression will be the product of the coefficients from each part. That is, 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the second part). \n\nSo, 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120.\n\nWait, let me double-check that. So, in the first part, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6, correct? Because in \\((a + b)^4\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\(k = 2\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). That's right.\n\nIn the second part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), we're looking for the constant term, which is when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. So, we set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which gives \\(m = 3\\). The coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\), which is 20. Correct.\n\nThen, since these two coefficients are multiplied together when expanding the entire expression, 6 * 20 = 120. That seems correct. So, I think the coefficient is 120.\n\nI don't think I made any mistakes here. The key was recognizing that we needed the constant term in the second expansion because we were looking for a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), so that when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), it remains \\(a^2b^2\\). If I had any other term from the second expansion, it would introduce a \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\) term, which would change the variables in the term we're interested in. So, yeah, 120 should be the correct coefficient.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is found by considering the product of the coefficients from each binomial expansion. From \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient is 6. From \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the constant term has a coefficient of 20. Multiplying these gives 6 * 20 = 120.\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{120}\n\\]"

    "text": " \n\nWait, but the problem is asking specifically for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). That means I need to find the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2. So, in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\), the general term is \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\\). I want \\(a^2b^2\\), so I need \\(4 - k = 2\\) for \\(a\\) and \\(k = 2\\) for \\(b\\). That makes sense because \\(4 - 2 = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Let me calculate that: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient is 6. \n\nBut wait, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, does this affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)? Hmm, I think so because when you multiply two expressions together, each term from the first expression gets multiplied by each term from the second expression. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), we need to see if the terms from the second part affect the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. \n\nLooking at the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), this is another binomial expansion. Using the binomial theorem again, each term in this expansion is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying that, it becomes \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). \n\nNow, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term from the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term from the second expansion. However, since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), the terms from the second expansion must not affect the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). That is, the second part must contribute a term that is just a constant (i.e., without any \\(a\\) or \\(b\\)) so that when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), it remains \\(a^2b^2\\). \n\nBut wait, the second part is in terms of \\(c\\), so it doesn't have any \\(a\\) or \\(b\\). So, actually, every term in the second expansion is just a coefficient multiplied by some power of \\(c\\). Therefore, when we multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by any term from the second expansion, the result will be \\(a^2b^2\\) times that coefficient times some power of \\(c\\). But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), we need to consider all possible terms from the second expansion that, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), result in \\(a^2b^2\\) times a coefficient. \n\nWait, no, that's not quite right. Let me think again. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when expanding, each term from the first expansion is multiplied by each term from the second. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first expansion, and it's multiplied by every term from the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Because each term from the second part is just a constant (with respect to \\(a\\) and \\(b\\)), so when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each of those, you just get \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by the sum of the coefficients from the second expansion. \n\nSo, to clarify, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nBut wait, the sum of all coefficients in a polynomial is found by plugging in 1 for all variables. So, if I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = (2)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion is 64. \n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). \n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. Let me double-check. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first part, and when multiplied by each term from the second part, which is a polynomial in \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire second polynomial. But actually, no, because each term from the second polynomial is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial. \n\nAlternatively, another way to think about it is that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, and since the second part is being multiplied by that term, the total coefficient becomes 6 times whatever the second part contributes. But since the second part is a polynomial in \\(c\\), it doesn't affect the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), so all terms in the second part will contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the total coefficient is indeed 6 times the sum of coefficients in the second part, which is 64, giving 384. \n\nWait, but let me think again. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^4 \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^6 \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). Then, when I multiply these two, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first sum when \\(k = 2\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} a^2b^2\\), and it gets multiplied by every term in the second sum, which is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} \\times \\sum_{m=0}^6 \\dbinom{6}{m}\\). \n\nBut \\(\\sum_{m=0}^6 \\dbinom{6}{m} = 2^6 = 64\\), so yes, it's 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nAlternatively, if I were to consider the entire product, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nWait, but let me make sure that this is correct. Let me take a simpler example to test this. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, \\((a + b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2\\). The second part is \\(c + 1/c\\). So, the product is \\((a^2 + 2ab + b^2)(c + 1/c)\\). The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be zero because there's no \\(a^2b^2\\) term. Wait, but according to my earlier logic, the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) in the first part is 1, and the sum of coefficients in the second part is \\(1 + 1 = 2\\), so 1 * 2 = 2. But in reality, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is zero because there's no such term. Hmm, so my earlier logic must be flawed. \n\nWait, so maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me re-examine the problem. It says, \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\" in the product. So, in the example I just did, \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)\\), the product is \\(a^2c + a^2/c + 2abc + 2ab/c + b^2c + b^2/c\\). There is no \\(a^2b^2\\) term, so the coefficient is zero. But according to my earlier logic, I would have said 1 (coefficient of \\(a^2\\)) times 2 (sum of coefficients in the second part) = 2, which is incorrect. So, my earlier approach is wrong. \n\nWait, so what's the correct approach? Let me think again. \n\nI think I made a mistake in assuming that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the coefficient from the first part times the sum of coefficients from the second part. But in reality, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) can only come from the first part, and when you multiply by the second part, you have to consider that each term from the second part is a separate variable. Therefore, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product can only come from the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by any term from the second part. But since the second part doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will just be multiplied by each term in the second part, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) where \\(k\\) varies. \n\nBut the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in other words, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Because each term in the second part is a constant (with respect to \\(a\\) and \\(b\\)), so when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second part, you get multiple terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), each with the same coefficient as \\(a^2b^2\\) times the coefficient from the second part. \n\nWait, but in my earlier example, that approach gave the wrong answer. So, perhaps the problem is that in the product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is not just multiplied by the sum of coefficients, but rather, it's multiplied by each term, which includes different powers of \\(c\\). However, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the coefficient from the first part times the entire second polynomial. But that would mean that the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. \n\nWait, perhaps I misread the problem. Let me check: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). That is, it's treating \\(a^2b^2\\) as a term, and all the other variables (like \\(c\\)) are just part of the coefficient. So, in other words, the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\), but the problem is asking for the coefficient, which is a number. Wait, but that doesn't make sense because the coefficient would involve \\(c\\). \n\nWait, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating \\(c\\) as another variable. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would have a coefficient that is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient, so perhaps it's just the numerical coefficient, treating \\(c\\) as a variable. But in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second part, which is 64, giving 384. But in my earlier example, that approach didn't work. \n\nWait, let me try that example again. Let me take \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be zero because there's no such term. But according to my approach, the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) in the first part is 1, and the sum of coefficients in the second part is \\(1 + 1 = 2\\), so 1 * 2 = 2. But in reality, the coefficient is zero. So, that approach is wrong. \n\nTherefore, my initial approach is incorrect. So, what's the correct way to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product? \n\nI think the key is that in the product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) can only come from the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), and when multiplied by any term from the second part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire second polynomial. \n\nBut that would mean that the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense if we're just looking for a numerical coefficient. Therefore, perhaps the problem is only considering the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, so the coefficient would indeed be a polynomial in \\(c\\). \n\nWait, but the problem didn't specify anything about \\(c\\), so maybe it's just asking for the coefficient, which would include the terms from \\(c\\). But that seems unlikely. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), meaning that we need to sum over all possible powers of \\(c\\). \n\nWait, but in the example I did earlier, \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be zero because there's no such term. But according to the approach of multiplying the coefficient from the first part by the sum of coefficients from the second part, it would be 1 * 2 = 2, which is incorrect. Therefore, that approach is wrong. \n\nSo, perhaps the correct approach is that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient from the first part times the entire second polynomial. But that would mean that the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which seems odd. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating \\(c\\) as a constant. But that doesn't make sense because \\(c\\) is a variable. \n\nWait, perhaps the problem is only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, in other words, the coefficient would be the sum of all coefficients from the second part multiplied by the coefficient from the first part. \n\nBut in my earlier example, that approach gave the wrong answer. So, perhaps the correct way is to recognize that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient from the first part times the entire second polynomial, but if we're only interested in the coefficient as a numerical value, we have to consider that the second polynomial contributes a factor that doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6 times the entire second polynomial, which is 6 * (c + 1/c)^6. But that's a polynomial in \\(c\\), not a numerical coefficient. \n\nWait, but the problem is asking for the coefficient, so perhaps it's expecting a numerical coefficient. Therefore, maybe I misinterpreted the problem. Perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where the exponents of \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are 2, 2, and 0, respectively. \n\nWait, but the problem didn't specify anything about \\(c\\), so that's a possible interpretation. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), which would be a polynomial in \\(c\\). \n\nWait, but the problem is written as \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), so it's a product of two polynomials, one in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the other in \\(c\\). So, when you multiply them, you get a polynomial where each term is a product of a term from the first polynomial and a term from the second. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient from the first polynomial times the entire second polynomial, because \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by every term in the second polynomial. \n\nBut that would mean that the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which seems odd. Therefore, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, so the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\). \n\nWait, but the problem didn't specify, so perhaps it's expecting a numerical coefficient. Therefore, maybe the correct approach is to consider that the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term from the second polynomial, and since we're only interested in the coefficient, we need to sum over all those contributions. \n\nWait, but in that case, the coefficient would be the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all coefficients from the second part, which is 6 * 64 = 384. But in my earlier example, that approach gave the wrong answer. \n\nWait, but in the example, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is zero, but according to that approach, it's 1 * 2 = 2, which is incorrect. So, perhaps that approach is wrong. \n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that in the example, the second polynomial is of degree 1, so when you multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), you get terms like \\(a^2b^2c\\) and \\(a^2b^2/c\\), but there is no \\(a^2b^2\\) term on its own. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is zero. \n\nSo, in the original problem, the second polynomial is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which when expanded, has terms like \\(c^6\\), \\(6c^4\\), \\(15c^2\\), \\(20\\), \\(15c^{-2}\\), \\(6c^{-4}\\), \\(c^{-6}\\). So, when you multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), you get terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(6a^2b^2c^4\\), etc. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is zero because there's no term without \\(c\\). \n\nWait, but that contradicts my earlier approach. So, perhaps the correct answer is zero. But that seems counterintuitive because the coefficient from the first part is 6, and the second part has a constant term. \n\nWait, let me check. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) includes a constant term when \\(c^6\\) and \\(c^{-6}\\) are multiplied by the appropriate coefficients. Wait, actually, the constant term occurs when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. So, in the expansion, the term where \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which is when \\(m = 3\\). So, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). \n\nTherefore, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by 20, giving a term \\(20a^2b^2\\). But also, it's multiplied by all other terms from the second expansion, which have powers of \\(c\\). So, in the product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is present with a coefficient of 20, and also multiplied by \\(c^6\\), \\(6c^4\\), etc. \n\nBut the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would be 20, because that's the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). But if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), meaning that it's considering all terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present, regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then the coefficient would be 6 times the entire second polynomial, which is 6*(c + 1/c)^6, which is a polynomial in \\(c\\). \n\nBut I think the problem is more likely asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\). Therefore, the coefficient would be 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nWait, but let me clarify. The problem says, \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" It doesn't specify anything about \\(c\\), so perhaps it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), meaning that we need to sum over all possible powers of \\(c\\). \n\nBut in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 6 * 64 = 384. However, in my earlier example, this approach gave the wrong answer, so I'm confused. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, which would be a polynomial in \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the sum of all terms in the product where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present, regardless of the power of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient would be 6 times the entire second polynomial, which is 6*(c + 1/c)^6. \n\nBut that seems odd because the coefficient is usually a number, not a polynomial. Therefore, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, so the coefficient would be 6*(c + 1/c)^6. \n\nWait, but that doesn't make sense because the coefficient should be a number. Therefore, perhaps the problem is only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of the power of \\(c\\), which would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nBut in my earlier example, this approach gave the wrong answer. So, perhaps the problem is only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nWait, but the problem didn't specify anything about \\(c\\), so it's ambiguous. However, given that the problem includes \\(c\\) in the expression, it's more likely that it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), meaning that we need to sum over all terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present, regardless of the power of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nBut in my earlier example, this approach gave the wrong answer, so I'm unsure. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nWait, let me think again. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product comes from multiplying \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part by each term from the second part. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is \\(6 \\times \\left(c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15c^{-2} + 6c^{-4} + c^{-6}\\right)\\). So, the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\). \n\nBut the problem is asking for the coefficient, which is usually a number. Therefore, perhaps the problem is miswritten, or perhaps it's intended to consider only the constant term in \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) would be 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, which is a polynomial in \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the sum of all terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any power of \\(c\\), which would be 6 times the entire second polynomial, which is 6*(c + 1/c)^6. \n\nBut that seems odd because the coefficient is usually a number. Therefore, perhaps the problem is only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. \n\nWait, but let me check the original problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" It doesn't specify anything about \\(c\\), so perhaps it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, treating \\(c\\) as another variable. Therefore, the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\), specifically 6*(c + 1/c)^6. \n\nBut that seems unlikely because the problem is asking for the coefficient, which is usually a number. Therefore, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), which would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nBut in my earlier example, this approach gave the wrong answer, so I'm confused. \n\nWait, perhaps I should consider that in the original problem, the second polynomial is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which has a constant term of 20. Therefore, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), it gives a term \\(20a^2b^2\\). All other terms from the second polynomial would give terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), where \\(k\\) is non-zero. Therefore, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then it's 20. \n\nWait, but that contradicts the earlier approach. \n\nWait, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, which includes all powers of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient would be 6 times the entire second polynomial, which is 6*(c + 1/c)^6. \n\nBut that seems odd because the coefficient is a number.

Therefore, perhaps the correct approach is to consider that the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term from the second polynomial, and since we're only interested in the coefficient, we need to sum over all those contributions. Therefore, the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nBut in my earlier example, this approach gave the wrong answer, so I'm confused. \n\nWait, perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, regardless of the power of \\(c\\), meaning that we need to consider all terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present, regardless of \\(c\\).

Therefore, perhaps the problem is only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. \n\nWait, perhaps I should look for another approach. Let me think about the multinomial theorem. The product is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, when expanding, each term is of the form \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}a^{4 - k}b^k \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\). Therefore, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) requires \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\), which gives \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Then, the term from the second part can be any term \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the entire second polynomial, which is 6*(c + 1/c)^6. \n\nBut that seems odd because the coefficient is a number. Therefore, perhaps the problem is only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 6 * \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\) = 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nWait, but the problem didn't specify anything about \\(c\\), so it's ambiguous.

    "text": " \n\nLet me start by looking at the first part of the expression, which is \\((a + b)^4\\). I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in this part. So, using the binomial theorem, I can write:\n\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n\\]\n\nI'm specifically interested in the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2. That would occur when \\(4 - k = 2\\), which means \\(k = 2\\). So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\).\n\nLet me compute that. \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) is the number of ways to choose 2 items from 4, which is \\(\\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient from the first part is 6.\n\nNow, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but wait, the second part involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), which are different variables. So, does this mean that \\(a^2b^2\\) is independent of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\)? Or does the multiplication affect the coefficient?\n\nHmm, I think since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), the multiplication would just multiply the coefficients. That is, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the coefficient from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) for the term that doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\). But wait, that might not make sense because \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) will have terms with various powers of \\(c\\), but since we're looking for \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), maybe we just need to consider the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nWait, that's a good point. Because when we multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the expansion will be a product of a term from the first expansion and a term from the second expansion. So, to get a term that only has \\(a^2b^2\\), we need to multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part by the constant term (i.e., the term with \\(c^0\\)) from the second part. Because if we multiply by any other term involving \\(c\\), the resulting term would have \\(c\\) raised to some power, but since we're only looking for \\(a^2b^2\\), the \\(c\\) part has to cancel out, so to speak.\n\nSo, I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me figure that out. Using the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\).\n\nWe want the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\).\n\nCalculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). Wait, no, that's not right. Let me compute it correctly. 6! is 720, 3! is 6, so 720 divided by (6 \u00d7 6) is 720 / 36, which is indeed 20. So, the constant term is 20.\n\nNow, going back to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficients from each part. That is, 6 (from the \\(a^2b^2\\) term) multiplied by 20 (the constant term from the second expansion). So, 6 \u00d7 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't miss anything. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, when we expand both parts, each term is a product of a term from the first expansion and a term from the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the first part, and to get the coefficient, we need to multiply it by the constant term from the second part, which is 20. So, yes, 6 \u00d7 20 = 120.\n\nI think that's correct. Let me just double-check. If I expand \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6, as I calculated before. Then, in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the constant term is when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, which happens at \\(m = 3\\), giving 20. So, multiplying 6 and 20 gives 120.\n\nIs there any other way this could be approached? Maybe by considering the entire expansion, but I think that would complicate things more. Alternatively, perhaps using multinomial coefficients, but since we're dealing with two separate variables in each part, the binomial approach seems sufficient.\n\nWait, another thought: when multiplying the two expansions, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is only affected by the constant term in the second expansion, because any other term would introduce a power of \\(c\\), which we don't want. So, yes, the coefficient is 6 \u00d7 20 = 120.\n\nI think that's the correct answer. Let me just recap to make sure I didn't skip any steps. First, find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6. Then, find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 20. Multiply them together to get 120. That should be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression.\n\nI don't see any mistakes in my reasoning, so I'm confident that the coefficient is 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem.\n\nFirst, consider the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\). Using the binomial theorem, we have:\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n\\]\nThe term \\(a^2b^2\\) occurs when \\(k = 2\\), so the coefficient is:\n\\[\n\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\n\\]\n\nNext, consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem, we have:\n\\[\n\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n\\]\nWe need the constant term, which occurs when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. Solving \\(6 - 2m = 0\\) gives \\(m = 3\\). The coefficient is:\n\\[\n\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\n\\]\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficients from each part:\n\\[\n6 \\times 20 = 120\n\\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

    "text": " \n\nLet me focus on the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\). If I expand this, each term will be of the form \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\\). I'm looking for the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2, which would be \\(a^2b^2\\). So, I need to find the value of \\(k\\) such that \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). That makes sense because \\(4 - 2 = 2\\). So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). \n\nCalculating that, \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient is 6. But wait, that's just the first part. The entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I need to consider the expansion of that part as well. \n\nNow, looking at \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), again, I can use the binomial theorem here. Each term in this expansion will be of the form \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\), which simplifies to \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). \n\nBut here's where I'm a bit confused. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\). So, does that mean I need to consider the entire expression and find the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\)? Or maybe I'm overcomplicating it. \n\nWait, no, I think I'm supposed to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. But actually, since the expression is a product of two separate expansions, \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the variables \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are independent of \\(c\\). So, when you multiply them together, the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from those involving \\(c\\). \n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, that doesn't make sense because the coefficient would then be a polynomial in \\(c\\), but the question is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not considering \\(c\\). So, maybe I need to consider the coefficient in the product, but only for the \\(a^2b^2\\) term, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. \n\nWait, perhaps I should think of it differently. When you multiply two polynomials together, the coefficients multiply. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by every term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't seem right either because the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) depend on the powers of \\(c\\). \n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, perhaps they are treating \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\), and \\(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\) as separate variables, and they just want the coefficient of the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present, regardless of the power of \\(c\\). \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), that is, the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\). Because if you consider the entire expression, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) can be multiplied by various powers of \\(c\\), so perhaps they want the coefficient where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, making it just a constant term. \n\nThat makes sense because otherwise, the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't seem likely. So, I think the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by the constant term from the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nSo, first, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Then, multiply that by the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which we already found to be 6. \n\nAlright, so let me work on finding the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem again, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We want the exponent of \\(c\\) to be zero, so set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). \n\nTherefore, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). Wait, that seems high. Let me check that again. \n\nWait, 6! is 720, and 3! is 6, so \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{720}{(6)(6)} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). Yeah, that's correct. So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. \n\nNow, going back to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) and the coefficient from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, that would be 6 (from \\(a^2b^2\\)) multiplied by 20 (from \\(c^0\\)), which is 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not missing anything. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\) with coefficient 6, and the term \\(c^0\\) comes from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) with coefficient 20. When you multiply these two parts together, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term is multiplied by the constant term 20, so the combined coefficient is indeed 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nIs there another way to think about this? Let me consider the entire expansion. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When you expand this, each term will be of the form \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}a^{4 - k}b^k \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\). \n\nWe are looking for the term where \\(a^{2}b^{2}\\), which happens when \\(k = 2\\), and \\(c^0\\), which happens when \\(m = 3\\). So, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} \\times \\dbinom{6}{3}\\), which is 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nI think that's solid. So, the coefficient is 120. \n\nWait, but just to double-check, maybe I should consider if there's any interaction between \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\). But no, since they are separate variables, their exponents don't interfere with each other. So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) is independent of the \\(c\\) terms except for the constant term. \n\nAnother way to think about it: when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each polynomial. So, in this case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial is 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second polynomial is 20. So, the combined coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nI think that makes sense. So, I'm confident that the coefficient is 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem for both parts of the expression.\n\nFirst, consider the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\). Using the binomial theorem, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is given by:\n\\[\n\\binom{4}{2} a^2b^2\n\\]\nCalculating the binomial coefficient:\n\\[\n\\binom{4}{2} = \\frac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\n\\]\nSo, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\nNext, consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. Using the binomial theorem, each term is of the form:\n\\[\n\\binom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n\\]\nSetting the exponent equal to zero:\n\\[\n6 - 2m = 0 \\implies m = 3\n\\]\nThe coefficient for this term is:\n\\[\n\\binom{6}{3} = \\frac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\n\\]\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficients from each part:\n\\[\n6 \\times 20 = 120\n\\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

    "text": " \n\nThe first part of the expression is \\((a + b)^4\\). Let me expand that using the binomial theorem. So, for \\(n = 4\\), each term will be \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\\) where \\(k\\) goes from 0 to 4. That means the expansion will have terms like \\(a^4\\), \\(4a^3b\\), \\(6a^2b^2\\), \\(4ab^3\\), and \\(b^4\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in this part is 6, right? Because that's the coefficient in front of \\(a^2b^2\\).\n\nNow, the second part of the expression is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I need to figure out what this part contributes to the overall expression. Wait, but the question is about the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, actually, since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), maybe the second part doesn't affect the \\(a^2b^2\\) term? Hmm, that might be the case because \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) are separate variables or terms, so when I multiply the two parts together, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will come from the first part, and the second part will contribute some multiple, but not affect the power of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). \n\nWait, but actually, when you multiply two expressions together, each term from the first expression is multiplied by each term from the second. So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I need to consider all the terms in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) and how they multiply with the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. But actually, since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), maybe I just need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and then multiply it by the entire expansion of the second part, but since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term without \\(c\\), the coefficient would just be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in the second part? Wait, no, that doesn't make sense because each term in the second part has a different power of \\(c\\), so when I multiply, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, but since I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), I need to find the terms in the second expansion that are constants, i.e., \\(c^0\\), because only those will multiply with \\(a^2b^2\\) to give a term that's still \\(a^2b^2\\) times a constant.\n\nWait, that might be it. So, I think I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is the coefficient of \\(c^0\\), and then multiply that by the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part. So, let's tackle that.\n\nFirst, let's find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Again, using the binomial theorem, this expansion will have terms of the form \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, the exponent of \\(c\\) in each term is \\(6 - 2k\\). We want the term where the exponent is 0, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\), which is 20. So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20.\n\nNow, going back to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). As we found earlier, the coefficient in the first part is 6, and the constant term in the second part is 20. So, multiplying these together, we get \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nWait, but let me double-check that. So, the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) gives \\(a^2b^2\\) with coefficient 6, and the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) gives a constant term of 20. When I multiply these two expansions together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, but only the constant term (20) will result in a term that's \\(a^2b^2\\) times a constant. All other terms in the second expansion will have powers of \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), which will make the overall term have some power of \\(c\\), but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), but wait, actually, no. Wait, the question is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but in the entire expression, which includes all possible powers of \\(c\\). So, does that mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the sum of all the coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by 6? Or is it only the constant term?\n\nWait, no, I think I might have made a mistake earlier. Let me clarify. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, when we multiply these two, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, because each term in the second expansion is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), so the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second part.\n\nWait, but that doesn't sound right because the second expansion has terms with different powers of \\(c\\), so unless we're considering the entire expression as a polynomial in \\(a, b, c\\), then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second part. But wait, the sum of all coefficients in the second part is found by setting \\(c = 1\\). So, let me compute that.\n\nThe sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is when \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, if that's the case, then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 times 64, which is 384. But that contradicts my earlier conclusion of 120. Hmm, so which one is correct?\n\nWait, let me think again. The problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in the entire expression, every term will be of the form \\(a^kb^{4 - k}c^m\\), where \\(k\\) ranges from 0 to 4, and \\(m\\) can be any integer depending on the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, if the question is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), that is, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^m\\) for any integer \\(m\\), then the coefficient would be the sum over all \\(m\\) of the coefficients from each term. But that's not usually how coefficients are defined. Typically, when you're asked for the coefficient of a specific term like \\(a^2b^2\\), it's in the context of the entire expression, treating all variables as separate. So, perhaps the question is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which would include all possible powers of \\(c\\). But that's a bit ambiguous.\n\nWait, no, actually, I think I misread the problem. Let me check again. The problem says: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, in the product, each term is a product of a term from the first expansion and a term from the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, which are terms like \\(c^6\\), \\(6c^4\\), \\(15c^2\\), \\(20\\), \\(15c^{-2}\\), \\(6c^{-4}\\), and \\(c^{-6}\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the sum of all these coefficients multiplied by 6. So, that would be 6 times (1 + 6 + 15 + 20 + 15 + 6 + 1) = 6 times 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but that seems too high. Alternatively, maybe the problem is considering only the constant term with respect to \\(c\\), so that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the constant term in the second expansion, which is 20, giving 120. But I'm not sure which interpretation is correct. Let me think about how the problem is phrased. It says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)\". So, in the entire product, each term is a product of a term from the first polynomial and a term from the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(6a^2b^2c^4\\), etc. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the sum of all the coefficients from the second expansion, because each term in the second expansion is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion.\n\nBut the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, the coefficient would be 6 * 64 = 384. But that seems high. Alternatively, if the problem is only considering the term where the power of \\(c\\) is zero, then it's 6 * 20 = 120. But I think the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), so it's 384.\n\nWait, but let me check that again. If I think of the entire expression as a product, then each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. So, that's the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). But I'm not sure if that's what the problem is asking. Alternatively, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it's 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is written as \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), so the entire expression is a product of two polynomials, one in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the other in \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, when you multiply them, the variables are independent, so the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part, which has various powers of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. So, that's the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times any power of \\(c\\). But if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it's 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nBut the problem just says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", without specifying anything about \\(c\\). So, I think it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, that would mean that the coefficient is 384. But I'm not entirely sure. Let me check with an example.\n\nSuppose I have \\((a + b)^1 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, expanding, we get \\(a c + a/c + b c + b/c\\). The coefficient of \\(a\\) would be \\(c + 1/c\\), so the coefficient of \\(a\\) is \\(c + 1/c\\), which is a polynomial in \\(c\\). Similarly, the coefficient of \\(b\\) would be the same. But if the problem had asked for the coefficient of \\(a\\) in \\((a + b)(c + 1/c)\\), then it would be \\(c + 1/c\\), which is a polynomial, not a single number. So, in that case, the coefficient is not a single number but a polynomial.\n\nBut in our original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would similarly be a polynomial in \\(c\\), unless we are only considering the constant term. But the problem didn't specify, so perhaps it's expecting a single numerical coefficient, which would imply that we're considering the term where the power of \\(c\\) is zero, i.e., the constant term. So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but that's a bit confusing. Let me think again. If the problem had been \\((a + b)^4 \\times (c + d)^6\\), then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 2^6 = 6 * 64 = 384, because each term in the second expansion is a constant with respect to \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). But in our case, the second expansion has terms with \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), so they are variables. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be a polynomial in \\(c\\), specifically 6 times the entire second expansion. But that seems unlikely because the problem is asking for a coefficient, which is usually a number.\n\nTherefore, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\). In that case, the coefficient would be 6 * 20 = 120. That makes more sense because it results in a single number, which is what the problem is likely expecting.\n\nSo, to summarize, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 20, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times the constant term is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me think about how the product works. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). When you multiply these, each term from \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by each term from the second part, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(6a^2b^2c^4\\), \\(15a^2b^2c^2\\), \\(20a^2b^2\\), \\(15a^2b^2c^{-2}\\), \\(6a^2b^2c^{-4}\\), and \\(a^2b^2c^{-6}\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the sum of all the coefficients from the second expansion, which is 1 + 6 + 15 + 20 + 15 + 6 + 1 = 64, multiplied by 6, giving 384. But that would be if we're considering the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). However, if we're only interested in the term where the power of \\(c\\) is zero, then it's just 20 * 6 = 120.\n\nGiven that the problem didn't specify anything about \\(c\\), I think the intended answer is 120, as it's the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). Therefore, the final answer is 120.\n\nWait, but to be thorough, let me compute both possibilities. If the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), it's 384. If it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), it's 120. Since the problem didn't specify, it's a bit ambiguous. However, in problems like this, unless specified, they usually ask for the coefficient of a term that includes all variables, but in this case, \\(c\\) is another variable, so the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is part of a larger expression. So, perhaps the intended answer is 120, as it's the coefficient when considering the term with \\(a^2b^2\\) and no \\(c\\). Alternatively, maybe the problem is expecting 384, considering all coefficients. Hmm.\n\nWait, let me check the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but in the context of the entire product, which includes \\(c\\). So, unless specified, I think it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. But I'm not entirely sure. However, in many problems, when they ask for the coefficient of a term in a product of polynomials, they are referring to the term with that exact combination of variables, regardless of other variables. So, in this case, \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by each term in the second polynomial, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the sum of all the coefficients from the second polynomial multiplied by 6. So, that would be 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but that seems contradictory. Let me think of it this way: If I have two polynomials, P(a, b) and Q(c), then the coefficient of a term in P(a, b) would be multiplied by the entire Q(c). So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in P(a, b) * Q(c), it would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in P(a, b) multiplied by Q(c). So, that would be 6 * Q(c). So, the coefficient is a polynomial in c, not a single number. Therefore, unless we're considering the constant term in Q(c), which is 20, then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) would be 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nGiven that, I think the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, which would include all powers of \\(c\\), but that would make the coefficient a polynomial, not a single number. Therefore, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. Alternatively, if it's expecting a single number, it's 120.\n\nWait, but the problem didn't specify anything about \\(c\\), so perhaps it's expecting 384, considering all coefficients. Hmm, I'm a bit confused. Let me try to compute both and see which makes more sense.\n\nFirst, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is:\n\n\\[\n\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n\\]\n\nSo, the coefficients are:\n\n- \\(k=0\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{0} = 1\\), term: \\(c^6\\)\n- \\(k=1\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{1} = 6\\), term: \\(6c^4\\)\n- \\(k=2\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{2} = 15\\), term: \\(15c^2\\)\n- \\(k=3\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\), term: \\(20c^0\\)\n- \\(k=4\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{4} = 15\\), term: \\(15c^{-2}\\)\n- \\(k=5\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{5} = 6\\), term: \\(6c^{-4}\\)\n- \\(k=6\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{6} = 1\\), term: \\(c^{-6}\\)\n\nSo, the sum of all coefficients is 1 + 6 + 15 + 20 + 15 + 6 + 1 = 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nBut if we're only considering the constant term, it's 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nGiven that, I think the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), so the answer is 384. But I'm not entirely sure because sometimes problems specify that they want the term independent of certain variables. Since the problem didn't specify, I'm a bit torn. However, considering that the problem is written as \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), and it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), it's likely that it's expecting the coefficient when considering all possible powers of \\(c\\), so 384. But I'm not 100% certain.\n\nWait, but let me think about how coefficients are usually presented. If I have a term like \\(a^2b^2c^3\\), the coefficient would include any factors from all the variables. So, in this case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be a sum over all possible \\(c\\) terms, because each term in the product is \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by a term from the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by 6, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but I think I'm overcomplicating it. Let me try to approach it differently. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. So, in the product, each term is of the form \\(a^kb^{4 - k} \\times c^m\\), where \\(k\\) is from 0 to 4 and \\(m\\) can be any integer from -6 to +6. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) occurs when \\(k=2\\), and for each possible \\(m\\), there's a corresponding term. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the sum over all \\(m\\) of the coefficients from the second expansion, because each term in the second expansion is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). So, that sum is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but that seems to contradict the idea that the coefficient is a single number. But in reality, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which would have terms with different powers of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient isn't a single number but a polynomial. However, the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, so perhaps it's expecting the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nWait, but the problem didn't specify \\(c^0\\), so I'm not sure. Maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, so the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem is presented as asking for a numerical coefficient, so perhaps it's expecting 120.\n\nI think I need to make a decision here. Given that the problem didn't specify anything about \\(c\\), but just asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and considering that in the product, \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. Therefore, the answer is 384.\n\nWait, but I'm going back and forth. Let me check with a simpler example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^1 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, expanding, we get \\(a c + a/c + b c + b/c\\). The coefficient of \\(a\\) is \\(c + 1/c\\), which is a polynomial. Similarly, the coefficient of \\(b\\) is the same. So, in this case, the coefficient of \\(a\\) is a polynomial, not a number. So, if the problem had been \\((a + b)^1 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\), and asked for the coefficient of \\(a\\), it's \\(c + 1/c\\). But if it asked for the coefficient of \\(a c^0\\), then it's 1.\n\nTherefore, in our original problem, if it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), it's the polynomial 6 times the entire second expansion, which is 6*(c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15c^{-2} + 6c^{-4} + c^{-6}). But that's a polynomial, not a single number. Therefore, unless the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120, the answer would be a polynomial. Since the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, I think it's expecting 120.\n\nSo, after all this thinking, I believe the correct answer is 120, which is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). Therefore, the final answer is 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break down the problem into two parts using the binomial theorem.\n\n1. **Expanding \\((a + b)^4\\):**\n   Using the binomial theorem, we know that:\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\), and its coefficient is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\n   \\]\n\n2. **Expanding \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   Using the binomial theorem, we know that:\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n   \\]\n   We need the constant term (i.e., the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0). This occurs when \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\). The coefficient is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\n   \\]\n\n3. **Combining the results:**\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficient from the first expansion and the constant term from the second expansion. Therefore, we multiply 6 by 20:\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 20 = 120\n   \\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

So, I think I should handle each part separately and then see how they combine. Let me start with the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\). \n\nUsing the binomial theorem, \\((a + b)^4\\) can be expanded as:\n\\[\n\\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n\\]\nSo, the terms will be:\n- When \\(k=0\\): \\(\\dbinom{4}{0}a^4b^0 = 1 \\cdot a^4\\)\n- When \\(k=1\\): \\(\\dbinom{4}{1}a^3b^1 = 4a^3b\\)\n- When \\(k=2\\): \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\\)\n- When \\(k=3\\): \\(\\dbinom{4}{3}a^1b^3 = 4ab^3\\)\n- When \\(k=4\\): \\(\\dbinom{4}{4}a^0b^4 = 1 \\cdot b^4\\)\n\nSo, the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is \\(a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is 6. Okay, so that part is done.\n\nNow, the other part of the expression is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I need to expand this as well. Again, using the binomial theorem:\n\\[\n\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\n\\]\nSimplifying each term:\n- When \\(m=0\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{0}c^6 \\cdot 1 = 1 \\cdot c^6\\)\n- When \\(m=1\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{1}c^5 \\cdot \\dfrac{1}{c} = 6c^4\\)\n- When \\(m=2\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{2}c^4 \\cdot \\dfrac{1}{c^2} = 15c^2\\)\n- When \\(m=3\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}c^3 \\cdot \\dfrac{1}{c^3} = 20 \\cdot 1 = 20\\)\n- When \\(m=4\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{4}c^2 \\cdot \\dfrac{1}{c^4} = 15 \\cdot \\dfrac{1}{c^2}\\)\n- When \\(m=5\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{5}c^1 \\cdot \\dfrac{1}{c^5} = 6 \\cdot \\dfrac{1}{c^4}\\)\n- When \\(m=6\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{6}1 \\cdot \\dfrac{1}{c^6} = 1 \\cdot \\dfrac{1}{c^6}\\)\n\nSo, the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15\\dfrac{1}{c^2} + 6\\dfrac{1}{c^4} + \\dfrac{1}{c^6}\\).\n\nNow, the original problem is the product of these two expansions:\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = (a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4) \\times (c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15\\dfrac{1}{c^2} + 6\\dfrac{1}{c^4} + \\dfrac{1}{c^6})\n\\]\n\nBut wait, I'm supposed to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, in the product, each term from the first expansion will multiply each term from the second expansion. But since we're looking for \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term from the first part, and the second part is in terms of \\(c\\), which is a different variable. \n\nWait a minute, maybe I don't need to consider the \\(c\\) terms because \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But actually, no, because when you multiply two expressions, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. But since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables, the only term in the product that has \\(a^2b^2\\) is when we take \\(6a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion and multiply it by each term in the second expansion. However, the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). Wait, that might not be the case. Let me think again.\n\nWait, actually, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product. So, when you multiply the two expansions, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, which includes \\(c^6\\), \\(6c^4\\), \\(15c^2\\), 20, etc. But since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), we need to consider all possible terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present. But wait, no, because \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't make sense because the product would have terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2 \\times 6c^4\\), etc. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be \\(6 \\times\\) the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which isn't what the problem is asking. \n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, perhaps the problem is considering the entire product as a single expression and wants the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). But that's not possible because \\(a^2b^2\\) is just one term, and when multiplied by the second expansion, it would produce multiple terms with different powers of \\(c\\). So, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, considering all possible terms. But that would mean that the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\). However, the problem just asks for the coefficient, so perhaps it's considering the coefficient as a constant, meaning that it's looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by some power of \\(c\\). But the problem didn't specify a particular power of \\(c\\), so maybe I'm overcomplicating it.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, in other words, when you expand the entire product, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the same as the coefficient in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a sum of terms involving \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the coefficient should be a constant. So, maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable, so the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem just says \"the coefficient\", so perhaps it's looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by all the terms from the second expansion. But that would mean the coefficient isn't a single number, but a polynomial. However, the problem is phrased as \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", which suggests it's a single number, so maybe I'm missing something.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, considering all possible terms, but since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), the coefficient would be the same as the coefficient in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, which doesn't seem right. Alternatively, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then considering that multiplied by the entire second expansion, but that would still be a polynomial. \n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think differently. Maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, so the coefficient would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and that's it. But that seems too simple.\n\nWait, let me check the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, perhaps it's considering the entire product as a single expression, and \\(a^2b^2\\) is just one term, so the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).

So, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some \\(k\\), but it doesn't specify. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, considering that the second expansion doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms, so the coefficient remains 6. But that doesn't seem right because when you multiply, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would actually be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a sum of terms involving \\(c\\). So, the coefficient isn't a single number but a polynomial.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which would be 6 multiplied by the entire second expansion. But that would make the coefficient a polynomial, which isn't a single number. So, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and that's it. But that seems too straightforward, and the presence of the second part suggests that it's more involved.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to consider that the entire product is a single expression, and \\(a^2b^2\\) is just one term, so the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, which is possible. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which would be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in the second expansion. Let me check that.\n\nThe sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\). So, substituting \\(c = 1\\), we get \\((1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of the coefficients is 64. Therefore, if I take the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and multiply it by the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, considering all \\(c\\) terms, would be 6 * 64 = 384. But wait, that seems plausible, but I'm not sure if that's the correct approach.\n\nWait, let me think again. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, that would mean that in the product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is actually 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Therefore, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), it's actually a polynomial in \\(c\\), which is 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).

But that would still be a polynomial, which isn't a single number. So, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and that's it. But then why include the second part?\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, but since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), the coefficient would be the same as in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, which isn't a single number. So, perhaps the problem is miswritten, or I'm misunderstanding it.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, considering that the second expansion is multiplied by each term. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that's a polynomial, not a single number. Alternatively, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times a specific power of \\(c\\), say \\(c^0\\), then we would have to compute 6 times the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20. So, 6 * 20 = 120. That would make sense, and 120 is a single number. So, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), which is the constant term.\n\nWait, but the problem didn't specify \\(c^0\\), so I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), but that would still be a polynomial. So, perhaps the problem is expecting me to consider that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, and that's it, ignoring the \\(c\\) terms. But that seems unlikely because the problem includes both parts.\n\nWait, perhaps I should look at the problem again. It says: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, the entire expression is a product of two expressions, one in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the other in \\(c\\). So, when you multiply them, the variables are separate, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the same as in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(6 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that's a polynomial, not a single number. So, perhaps the problem is expecting me to recognize that the coefficient is a polynomial, and maybe it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be 6 times the constant term in the second expansion.\n\nLet me check that. The constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. From earlier, when \\(m=3\\), the term is 20. So, the constant term is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire product is 6 * 20 = 120. So, maybe the problem is asking for that.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that's a polynomial. Since the problem didn't specify a particular power of \\(c\\), maybe it's expecting the coefficient as a polynomial, but that seems unlikely. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and that's it. But that seems too simple, given that the problem includes the second part.\n\nWait, perhaps I should think about it differently. When you have two separate variables, \\(a, b\\) and \\(c\\), the terms in the product will be of the form \\(a^kb^{4 - k}c^m\\) where \\(k\\) ranges from 0 to 4 and \\(m\\) ranges from -6 to 6. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), etc. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is actually the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient is 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial. But since the problem asks for \"the coefficient\", perhaps it's expecting the coefficient to be a polynomial, but that's not a single number. So, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, considering that the second expansion is multiplied by each term, but only the constant term in \\(c\\) is considered. So, the coefficient would be 6 times the constant term in the second expansion, which is 20, giving 120. So, maybe that's the answer.\n\nWait, let me check that approach. If I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the product becomes \\((a + b)^4 \\times 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 * 64 = 384. But that's if I set \\(c = 1\\), which might not be the right approach.\n\nAlternatively, if I consider the entire expansion, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial. But since the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, perhaps it's expecting me to recognize that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, giving 384. But I'm not sure if that's correct.\n\nWait, let me think again. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, if the problem is asking for the coefficient as a polynomial, it would be \\(6(c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15/c^2 + 6/c^4 + 1/c^6)\\). But that's a long expression. However, the problem is phrased as \"the coefficient\", which usually refers to a single number, so perhaps the problem is expecting me to consider that the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion, but that's a polynomial, not a number.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that's still a polynomial. So, perhaps the problem is expecting me to compute the coefficient as a polynomial, but that's not a single number. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), which would be 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, let's try to clarify. The original problem is: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, the variables are \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\). The term \\(a^2b^2\\) is part of the first factor, and the second factor involves \\(c\\). So, when you multiply them, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), etc. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which is \\(6(c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15/c^2 + 6/c^4 + 1/c^6)\\). \n\nBut since the problem is asking for \"the coefficient\", which is usually a number, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times a specific power of \\(c\\), but it doesn't specify. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), which would be 6 times the entire expansion, but that's a polynomial.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, considering all possible powers of \\(c\\), which would mean that the coefficient is a polynomial, but the problem didn't specify. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable, so the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that's a polynomial, not a single number.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is miswritten, and it's actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be 6 times the constant term in the second expansion, which is 20, giving 120. Alternatively, maybe it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times the constant term, which would be 120.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and that's it. But that seems too simple, especially since the problem includes the second part.\n\nWait, perhaps I should look for similar problems or think about how such problems are usually structured. Typically, when you have a product of two expressions, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is found by multiplying the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each expression. But in this case, the terms are in different variables, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that's a polynomial, not a single number.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which is 6 times the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that's still a polynomial. So, maybe the problem is expecting me to write it as a polynomial, but the problem didn't specify, so I'm confused.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, regardless of the powers of \\(c\\), which would mean that the coefficient is a sum of terms involving \\(c\\). So, the coefficient would be 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial. But again, the problem is phrased as \"the coefficient\", which usually refers to a single number, so perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nWait, maybe I should think about the problem differently. Perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, so the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(6(c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15c^{-2} + 6c^{-4} + c^{-6})\\). But that's a long expression, and the problem didn't specify any particular term, so maybe that's not what it's asking for.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which is 6 times the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that's still a polynomial. So, perhaps the problem is expecting me to write it as such, but since the problem didn't specify, I'm not sure.\n\nWait, maybe I should consider that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, which is the same as the coefficient in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient is 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial. So, perhaps that's the answer.\n\nBut since the problem is phrased as \"the coefficient\", which usually refers to a single number, I'm starting to think that maybe the problem is miswritten or that I'm misunderstanding it. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, considering that the second expansion is multiplied by each term, but only the constant term is considered, giving 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, let's try to see if that makes sense. If I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the product becomes \\((a + b)^4 \\times 64\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, if I set \\(c = 1\\), the entire expression becomes \\((a + b)^4 \\times 64\\), so the coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384. But that's assuming that \\(c = 1\\), which might not be the case.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), so the coefficient is \\(6(c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15/c^2 + 6/c^4 + 1/c^6)\\). But that's a polynomial, not a single number.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, considering all possible powers of \\(c\\), which would be 6 times the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient is a polynomial, and the problem is expecting me to write it as such. So, the coefficient is \\(6(c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15c^{-2} + 6c^{-4} + c^{-6})\\).\n\nBut the problem didn't specify any particular power of \\(c\\), so I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting me to recognize that the coefficient is 6 times the expansion, but that's a polynomial, not a single number.\n\nWait, maybe I should consider that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), so the coefficient is \\(6 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the final answer is \\(6\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that's not a single number.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which is 6 times the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), so the coefficient is a polynomial, but the problem didn't specify, so I'm confused.\n\nWait, perhaps I should go back to the original problem and see if I misread something. The problem is: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, it's possible that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, which would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient is a polynomial, and the problem is expecting me to write it as such. So, the coefficient is \\(6(c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15c^{-2} + 6c^{-4} + c^{-6})\\).\n\nBut since the problem is phrased as \"the coefficient\", which usually refers to a single number, I'm starting to think that perhaps the problem is expecting me to consider that the coefficient is 6 times the constant term in the second expansion, which is 20, giving 120. So, maybe the answer is 120.\n\nWait, let me check that. If I take the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and multiply it by the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20, then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product is 6 * 20 = 120. So, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times the constant term in \\(c\\), then the answer is 120.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then it's a polynomial, but since the problem didn't specify, I'm not sure. However, considering that the problem is phrased as \"the coefficient\", which is usually a single number, I think the intended answer is 120, which is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\).\n\nSo, to summarize, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product is 6 * 20 = 120. So, the final answer is 120.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. If I expand \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6. Then, in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the constant term is when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, which occurs when \\(m=3\\), giving \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times the constant term in \\(c\\) is 120. So, I think that's the answer the problem is expecting.\n\nSo, after all that, I think the coefficient is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.

    "text": " \n\nSince the first part is \\((a + b)^4\\), I can expand this part first. Let me write out the expansion using the binomial theorem. The expansion will be \\(\\dbinom{4}{0}a^4 + \\dbinom{4}{1}a^3b + \\dbinom{4}{2}a^2b^2 + \\dbinom{4}{3}ab^3 + \\dbinom{4}{4}b^4\\). Calculating the coefficients, that's \\(1a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + 1b^4\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in this part is 6. \n\nBut wait, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I can't just stop here; I need to consider the other part as well. The question is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but it doesn't specify anything about the \\(c\\) terms. That probably means that the coefficient will be multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), right? \n\nSo, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), that term comes from the \\(6a^2b^2\\) in the first part. Then, when I multiply this by the second part, which is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) will be 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. But wait, no, that's not quite right. Because when you multiply two polynomials together, each term in the first polynomial multiplies each term in the second polynomial. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression will be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nWait, but that doesn't seem right either. Because if I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and the second part is in terms of \\(c\\), then when I multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each of those products will have a term with \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by some power of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would actually be 6 multiplied by the sum of the coefficients of all the terms in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nWait, no, that's not quite accurate. Let me think again. When you multiply two expressions, the coefficients multiply. But in this case, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term is only from the first part, and it's multiplied by every term in the second part. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that's not exactly correct either because the coefficients in the second part are not just numerical coefficients but also involve variables. \n\nHold on, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try to approach it differently. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). That term doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), so when we multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will be multiplied by every term in the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients in the second part. \n\nWait, so if I let \\(A = a + b\\) and \\(B = c + 1/c\\), then the product is \\(A^4 \\times B^6\\). The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(A^4\\) is 6, as I found earlier. Now, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(B^6\\). Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in \\(B^6\\), each term will contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. \n\nSo, to find the sum of all coefficients in \\(B^6\\), where \\(B = c + 1/c\\), I can substitute \\(c = 1\\) because substituting 1 into a polynomial gives the sum of its coefficients. Let me try that. \n\nSubstituting \\(c = 1\\) into \\(B\\), we get \\(1 + 1/1 = 2\\). Then, \\(B^6\\) becomes \\(2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of all coefficients in \\(B^6\\) is 64. \n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 64 (the sum of coefficients from the second part), which equals 384. \n\nWait a second, is that correct? Let me check my reasoning again. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is indeed 6. The second part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), when expanded, has terms like \\(c^6\\), \\(6c^4\\), \\(15c^2\\), \\(20\\), \\(15/c^2\\), \\(6/c^4\\), and \\(1/c^6\\). Each of these terms has a coefficient, and the sum of these coefficients is 64, as I found by substituting \\(c = 1\\). \n\nSo, when I multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each of these terms, each term's coefficient gets multiplied by 6. Therefore, the total coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times 64, which is 384. \n\nWait, but I'm not sure if I should be multiplying by 64. Let me think again. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) is in the first part, and when I multiply it by each term in the second part, each term's coefficient adds to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. So, the total coefficient is 6 (from \\(a^2b^2\\)) multiplied by each coefficient in the second expansion, summed together. But actually, the second expansion's coefficients are 1, 6, 15, 20, 15, 6, 1. So, their sum is indeed 64. \n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 * 64 = 384. Hmm, that seems correct. \n\nWait, but another way to think about it is that the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). The \\(a^2b^2\\) term is only dependent on the first part, and the second part is multiplied as a whole. So, the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But since we're only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and not any specific term involving \\(c\\), we need to consider all possible coefficients from the second part. \n\nAlternatively, if the problem had asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some \\(k\\), then we would have to find the specific term in the second expansion that has \\(c^k\\) and multiply it by 6. But since the problem doesn't specify any \\(c\\) terms, it's just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. Therefore, we need to sum all the coefficients from the second expansion and multiply by 6. \n\nSo, substituting \\(c = 1\\) into the second expansion gives the sum of coefficients, which is 64, as before. So, 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nWait, but let me confirm this with another approach. Let's consider that the entire expression is a product of two independent expansions. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and the sum of all coefficients in the second part. \n\nAlternatively, if I think of the entire expression as a product, then each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by every term in the second expansion, each contributing their own coefficients. Therefore, the total coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) across all terms involving \\(c\\) would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64. So, 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nI think that makes sense. Let me check with another example to see if this approach is correct. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, expanding \\((a + b)^2\\) gives \\(a^2 + 2ab + b^2\\). The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) here is 0 because there's no \\(a^2b^2\\) term in \\((a + b)^2\\). Wait, but in this case, the second part is \\((c + 1/c)\\). So, if I wanted the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), it would still be 0 because it's not present in the first part. \n\nBut if I take \\((a + b)^4\\) as before, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, and the second part is \\((c + 1/c)^6\\). So, the total coefficient is 6 times the sum of coefficients in the second part, which is 64. So, 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nWait, but let me think again: when I multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each of those products will be terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), etc. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the sum of all the coefficients of these terms. Since each term in the second expansion has a coefficient, and when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), the coefficient of each product term is the product of the coefficients. Therefore, the total coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the sum of the coefficients of each term in the second expansion multiplied by 6. \n\nWait, but that's the same as saying 6 times the sum of coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64. So, 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nI think that's correct. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by substituting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\(2^6 = 64\\). Multiplying these together gives \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\boxed{384}."

Because when \\(k = 2\\), the term is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}a^{4 - 2}b^2 = \\dbinom{4}{2}a^2b^2\\). I remember that \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) is 6 because \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6.\n\nBut wait, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, which is \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, does that mean I need to consider both parts together? Hmm, maybe I need to expand both binomials and then find the term where the product results in \\(a^2b^2\\). But since the second part involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), and the first part is in terms of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), maybe these variables are independent. So, perhaps the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just the coefficient from the first part, because the second part doesn't affect \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). \n\nWait, that doesn't seem right. Let me think again. The entire expression is the product of two binomials: one in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and another in \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, when you multiply them, each term from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term from the second expansion. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), maybe the coefficient is just the coefficient from the first part, and the second part contributes a factor that doesn't affect \\(a^2b^2\\). \n\nWait, but that doesn't make sense because the entire expression is the product of both expansions. So, if I have \\((a + b)^4\\) times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), then when I expand it, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), that term must come from multiplying \\(a^2b^2\\) by the term in the second expansion that has \\(c^0\\), because only then will the \\(c\\) terms cancel out. \n\nWait, so maybe I need to find the term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) that has \\(c^0\\), and then multiply it by the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion. That makes sense because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by a term with \\(c^0\\), you get \\(a^2b^2\\) times some constant, so the coefficient would be the product of the two coefficients. \n\nSo, let me try that approach. First, find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6 as I found earlier. Then, find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nTo find the term with \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), I can use the binomial theorem again. The expansion is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k\\). Simplifying each term, that's \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} c^{-k} = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). \n\nWe want the exponent of \\(c\\) to be 0, so we set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the term where \\(k = 3\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} c^{0}\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20.\n\nNow, since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, we take the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, and multiply it by the coefficient from the second part, which is 20. So, 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nWait, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120. Let me just make sure I didn't make a mistake. So, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. In \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. When you multiply these two parts together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by 20, so the coefficient becomes 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nI think that makes sense because the two binomials are multiplied together, and each term from the first is multiplied by each term from the second. Since we're only interested in the term where the \\(c\\) exponent is zero, that's the only term that contributes to \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms. So, the overall coefficient is the product of the two coefficients. \n\nWait, just to double-check, let me think about whether there's another way to approach this. Maybe by expanding both expressions and looking for the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. But that seems more complicated because the second part has six terms. But I think my approach is correct because the variables are independent, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is just the product of the coefficients from each part where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of the entire expression as a product of two independent expansions, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just the coefficient from the first expansion times the sum of all terms from the second expansion. But wait, no, because when you multiply, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. But since we're looking for a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), it's only the term where the exponents of \\(c\\) in the second expansion cancel out, which is the \\(c^0\\) term. So, that term is 20, as I found earlier. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120. I think that's correct.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Multiplying these gives 6 * 20 = 120.\n\n\\boxed{120}"

But in this case, the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), when expanded, has terms like \\(a^4\\), \\(a^3b\\), \\(a^2b^2\\), etc., and the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), when expanded, has terms involving \\(c^6\\), \\(c^5 \\cdot \\dfrac{1}{c}\\), and so on. So, when I multiply these together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the same as the coefficient from the first part, 6, multiplied by the sum of all terms in the second expansion because \\(a^2b^2\\) is a constant term with respect to \\(c\\). Wait, no, that's not correct. Because \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), so when you multiply it by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the final product would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. But that seems too large. Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), it's just 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, that's not quite right either because each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is multiplied by each term in \\((a + b)^4\\). So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients of all terms in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't make sense because the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) include terms with different powers of \\(c\\), so when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), they just become coefficients for terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), where \\(k\\) varies. But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would be the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. But wait, that would mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 multiplied by the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nWait, but the sum of the coefficients in a polynomial is found by setting all variables to 1. So, in this case, setting \\(c = 1\\), the sum of the coefficients would be \\((1 + 1/1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nBut wait, that seems too straightforward. Let me check if I'm missing something. Alternatively, maybe I'm supposed to consider that \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), so when multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), it just becomes \\(6 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would just be 6 times the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because only the constant term would contribute to the \\(a^2b^2\\) term when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). \n\nWait, that makes more sense. Because if I have \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by, say, \\(c^3\\), that would give a term \\(a^2b^2c^3\\), which isn't just \\(a^2b^2\\). So, actually, only the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) would contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. So, I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. \n\nUsing the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be zero, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). \n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (the constant term from the second part), which is 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nWait, that seems more accurate. Let me double-check. The first part gives 6 for \\(a^2b^2\\), and the second part's constant term is 20, so 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nAlternatively, another way to think about it is that when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum of the products of the coefficients of terms whose variables multiply to give the desired term. In this case, since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), we're looking for the product of the coefficients of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial and the constant term in the second polynomial. \n\nSo, yes, I think 120 is the correct coefficient.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is found by considering the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) and the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\)**: The term \\(a^2b^2\\) has a coefficient of \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n\n2. **Find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)**: Using the binomial theorem, the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero occurs when \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), so \\(k = 3\\). The coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n\n3. **Multiply the coefficients**: \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\boxed{120}."

    "text": " \n\nLet me start by looking at the first part of the expression, which is \\((a + b)^4\\). If I expand this using the binomial theorem, each term will be of the form \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\\), where \\(k\\) ranges from 0 to 4. I'm specifically interested in the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2, so that would be \\(a^2b^2\\). \n\nTo find the term with \\(a^2b^2\\), I need to find the value of \\(k\\) such that \\(4 - k = 2\\) for \\(a\\), which means \\(k = 2\\). So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Let me calculate that: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient is 6. \n\nNow, the expression is multiplied by another part, which is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I wonder if I need to consider this part when finding the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Hmm, since the term \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\), maybe the coefficient is just the product of the coefficients from each part. But wait, let me think again. \n\nActually, when you multiply two expressions together, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire second part, because \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), so the second part doesn't affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). \n\nWait, is that correct? Let me check. If I have two parts multiplied together, say \\(P(a, b)\\) and \\(Q(c)\\), then any term in \\(P(a, b)\\) will be multiplied by any term in \\(Q(c)\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(P(a, b)\\) will be multiplied by every term in \\(Q(c)\\), resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), etc. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\) at all. So, does that mean the coefficient is just the coefficient from the first part, because the second part can't contribute to a term without \\(c\\)? \n\nWait, that doesn't seem right because when you multiply, you might have terms where \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) cancel each other out. For example, if there's a term in the second part that is \\(c^0 = 1\\), then multiplying by that would leave \\(a^2b^2\\) as is. So, perhaps I need to consider the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. \n\nLet me think. The second part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem again, each term in this expansion will be \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the exponent of \\(c\\) in each term is \\(6 - 2m\\), where \\(m\\) ranges from 0 to 6. \n\nI need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero because that's the only term that, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), will result in a term that has only \\(a^2b^2\\). So, set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(6 = 2m\\), so \\(m = 3\\). \n\nTherefore, the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} c^{0} = \\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). \n\nSo, the constant term is 20. Therefore, when I multiply the two expressions together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) will be the product of the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, and the constant term from the second part, which is 20. \n\nCalculating that, 6 multiplied by 20 is 120. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120. \n\nWait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake. So, in the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) has a coefficient of 6. In the second part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the constant term is 20. Since the term \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the only way it can come about is by multiplying the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part by the constant term from the second part. So, 6 times 20 is indeed 120. \n\nI think that makes sense. So, the final coefficient is 120. \n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we start by expanding each part separately using the binomial theorem.\n\nFirst, consider the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\). Using the binomial theorem, each term is of the form \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\\). The term with \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\). The coefficient is:\n\\[\n\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\n\\]\n\nNext, consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem, each term is of the form \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We need the constant term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. Setting \\(6 - 2m = 0\\) gives \\(m = 3\\). The constant term is:\n\\[\n\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\n\\]\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficients from each part. Therefore, we multiply the coefficient from the first part (6) by the constant term from the second part (20):\n\\[\n6 \\times 20 = 120\n\\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

    "text": " \n\nWait, but the expression isn't just \\((a + b)^4\\), it's multiplied by another binomial expression \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I think I need to expand both parts separately and then see how they multiply together. But actually, since the question is only asking about the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), maybe I don't need to worry about the other variables, c and 1/c, because they won't affect the a and b terms. Hmm, is that right?\n\nLet me think. When I multiply two expressions, each term from the first expression gets multiplied by each term from the second expression. So, if I have \\((a + b)^4\\) expanded and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) expanded, then each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since the question is about \\(a^2b^2\\), which is only in terms of a and b, I can ignore the c terms because they won't affect the a and b parts. So, I can treat the two parts separately. \n\nSo, first, let me find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\). Using the binomial theorem, the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\\). So, the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) occurs is when \\(4 - k = 2\\), which means \\(k = 2\\). So, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\nNow, since the original expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), and we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve c, we can consider that the entire \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) part will multiply the 6 we just found. But wait, no, that's not quite right. Because when you multiply two expressions, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, actually, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by every term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).

Wait, no, that's not quite right either. Let me clarify.\n\nWait, actually, when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first polynomial gets multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is a constant with respect to c, so when multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product. So, in the product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by all the terms from the second expansion. However, in the product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will have coefficients multiplied by each term from the second expansion, but the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the c terms. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product will be the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't make sense because the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) has terms with c and 1/c, so when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a constant with respect to c, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would just be 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which would mean the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, that seems complicated. Maybe I'm overcomplicating it.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the powers of c. So, in the entire product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't seem right because the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) would be found by setting c=1, which would give \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, would the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) be 6 * 64 = 384? Wait, that seems high, but let me check.\n\nWait, no, that might not be the correct approach. Let me think again. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when you multiply these two expressions, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, which are terms involving c and 1/c. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be 6 (the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\)) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion, which is a polynomial in c and 1/c. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that exists in the product, but it's multiplied by various powers of c. So, perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the c terms, which would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). As I thought earlier, the sum of the coefficients in a polynomial is found by setting all variables to 1. So, if I set c=1 in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), I get \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 * 64 = 384. But I'm not sure if that's correct because when you set c=1, you're effectively summing all the coefficients, which might not be the right approach here.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. It says, \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)\". So, in the entire product, we're looking for the term \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by some combination of c and 1/c. But the problem is asking for the coefficient, so perhaps it's just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the c terms. So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 6*64=384. But I'm not entirely confident about this approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating c as a separate variable. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would have a coefficient that is the product of the coefficients from each part. So, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, and in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) (since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve c) is the middle term, which is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\), because when you expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term where the exponents of c cancel out (i.e., c^0) occurs when you have 3 c's and 3 1/c's, which is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 * 20 = 120. Hmm, that seems more plausible.\n\nWait, let me clarify. When you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each polynomial. So, in this case, to get the term \\(a^2b^2\\), you need to take the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from \\((a + b)^4\\) and multiply it by the term \\(c^0\\) (i.e., the constant term) from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient would be the product of the coefficients of these two terms, which is 6 * 20 = 120. That makes sense because when you multiply the two expansions, the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) is to take \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part and the constant term from the second part. So, the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nBut wait, let me make sure I'm not missing anything. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, so it's possible that even if the second part has terms with c, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), they would create terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), but the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the c terms. So, in that case, the coefficient would be the sum of all coefficients from the second part multiplied by the coefficient from the first part. But that would mean 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which is 6*64=384. But that seems different from the 120 I calculated earlier.\n\nWait, no, that approach would be correct if the problem was asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times any power of c, but I think the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the c terms. So, in the product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would have a coefficient that is the sum of all the coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by 6. But that would mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 6*64=384. But that contradicts my earlier thought where I considered only the constant term.\n\nI think I need to clarify what exactly the problem is asking for. It says, \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)\". So, in the product, each term is of the form \\(a^kb^{4 - k}c^m\\) or something like that, but the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of c. So, in other words, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) can be multiplied by any power of c, but the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of c would be the sum of all the coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by 6. But that seems a bit odd because the coefficient would then be a polynomial in c, but the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. So, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of the term \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the c terms, which would mean that the coefficient is 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would make the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) equal to \\(6 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial in c, but the problem is asking for a coefficient, which is a number. So, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where c cancels out. In that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 20 = 120. That makes sense because then the term would be \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is just \\(a^2b^2\\), and the coefficient would be 120.\n\nSo, to summarize, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part, which is 20, giving 120. Therefore, the answer should be 120.\n\nBut just to make sure, let me go through it again. The first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), has a term \\(a^2b^2\\) with coefficient 6. The second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), can be expanded, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\) because we need 3 c's and 3 1/c's to cancel out. \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, when we multiply these two parts, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by the constant term 20 from the second part, resulting in a term \\(a^2b^2\\) with coefficient 6 * 20 = 120. So, yes, that seems correct.\n\nI think I was confused earlier because I was considering whether to include all terms from the second expansion, but since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the c terms, the only term that contributes to \\(a^2b^2\\) without any c dependence is the constant term from the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by considering the contributions from each part separately. \n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\):** The term \\(a^2b^2\\) has a coefficient of \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n\n2. **Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):** The constant term (coefficient of \\(c^0\\)) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n\n3. **Multiply the coefficients:** The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

    "text": " \n\nWait, but in this problem, the expression is a product of two binomials: \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Hmm, so does that mean I need to expand both parts separately and then multiply them together? Or is there a way to find the coefficient without expanding everything?\n\nLet me think. The question specifically asks for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). That term only involves \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), so maybe I can focus on expanding \\((a + b)^4\\) first and then see how it interacts with the other part.\n\nOkay, so let me start by expanding \\((a + b)^4\\). Using the binomial theorem, that would be:\n\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n\\]\n\nSo, the terms would be:\n\n- When \\(k = 0\\): \\(\\dbinom{4}{0} a^4 b^0 = 1 \\cdot a^4 \\cdot 1 = a^4\\)\n- When \\(k = 1\\): \\(\\dbinom{4}{1} a^3 b^1 = 4 a^3 b\\)\n- When \\(k = 2\\): \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} a^2 b^2 = 6 a^2 b^2\\)\n- When \\(k = 3\\): \\(\\dbinom{4}{3} a^1 b^3 = 4 a b^3\\)\n- When \\(k = 4\\): \\(\\dbinom{4}{4} a^0 b^4 = 1 \\cdot b^4\\)\n\nSo, the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is \\(a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). Got that part down.\n\nNow, the other part of the expression is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Hmm, I need to expand this as well. Let me apply the binomial theorem here too.\n\nSo, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying that, it becomes:\n\n\\[\n\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m} = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n\\]\n\nSo, each term will have \\(c\\) raised to the power of \\(6 - 2m\\). Let me write out the terms:\n\n- When \\(m = 0\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{0} c^6 = 1 \\cdot c^6 = c^6\\)\n- When \\(m = 1\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{1} c^{4} = 6 c^4\\)\n- When \\(m = 2\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{2} c^{2} = 15 c^2\\)\n- When \\(m = 3\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} c^{0} = 20 \\cdot 1 = 20\\)\n- When \\(m = 4\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{4} c^{-2} = 15 c^{-2}\\)\n- When \\(m = 5\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{5} c^{-4} = 6 c^{-4}\\)\n- When \\(m = 6\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{6} c^{-6} = 1 c^{-6}\\)\n\nSo, the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15c^{-2} + 6c^{-4} + c^{-6}\\).\n\nNow, the original expression is the product of these two expansions: \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, that would be:\n\n\\[\n(a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4) \\times (c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15c^{-2} + 6c^{-4} + c^{-6})\n\\]\n\nBut I only need the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Hmm, so in the product, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will come from multiplying the \\(6a^2b^2\\) term in the first expansion by each term in the second expansion. However, since the second expansion only has terms with \\(c\\), \\(c^{-1}\\), etc., and no \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, but the coefficient will just be 6 times the coefficient from the second expansion.\n\nWait, no, that might not be accurate. Let me think again. When you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. So, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. Because each term in the second expansion is a constant (in terms of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\)), so when you multiply \\(6a^2b^2\\) by each of those constants, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) will be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion.\n\nWait, but is that correct? Let me verify. The second expansion is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial in \\(c\\) only. So, when you multiply by \\(6a^2b^2\\), each term in the second expansion will contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product will be \\(6 \\times\\) (sum of the coefficients in the second expansion).\n\nBut wait, the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\). Let me check that. If I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion is 64.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\nWait, but that seems high. Let me think again. Maybe I'm making a mistake here. Because when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each polynomial. But in this case, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term is only present in the first polynomial, and the second polynomial doesn't have any \\(a\\) or \\(b\\) terms. So, when you multiply, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will be multiplied by each term in the second polynomial, but the resulting terms will have \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by each power of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would actually be \\(6 \\times\\) (sum of the coefficients in the second expansion). But wait, the sum of the coefficients is 64, so that would make it 6*64=384.\n\nBut I'm not sure if that's correct because I'm thinking that maybe the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just 6 times the entire second expansion, but that doesn't make sense because the second expansion is in terms of \\(c\\), so the product would have terms like \\(6a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(6a^2b^2c^4\\), etc. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is actually 6 multiplied by each term in the second expansion, but that would mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the entire second expansion, which isn't a single coefficient. Wait, I think I'm confusing something here.\n\nWait, no. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). But in the product, the terms would be of the form \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) where \\(k\\) can be various exponents. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product isn't just a single number because it's multiplied by different powers of \\(c\\). So, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). Hmm, that might make more sense.\n\nWait, but the problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\". It doesn't specify any particular power of \\(c\\), so perhaps it's considering all terms where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2 and 2, respectively, and the coefficient is the sum of all such coefficients across different powers of \\(c\\).\n\nWait, but that seems a bit ambiguous. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), that is, the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\). Because if you set \\(c^0\\), that would be the constant term in the second expansion.\n\nWait, but the problem doesn't specify any power of \\(c\\), so perhaps it's considering the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\). Hmm, but that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the entire second expansion, which doesn't make sense because the coefficient should be a single number. So, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some specific \\(k\\), but it's not stated. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, treating \\(c\\) as a variable, so the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\). But that seems unlikely because the problem just asks for a coefficient, implying a numerical value.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in interpreting the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, perhaps the problem is considering the entire product as a polynomial in \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\), and \\(1/c\\), and it's asking for the coefficient of the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) appears, regardless of the power of \\(c\\). But in that case, the coefficient would be the sum of all coefficients where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, that would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6*64=384.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), that is, the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by the constant term in the second expansion. Let me check that.\n\nIn the second expansion, the constant term is when \\(m=3\\), which is 20. So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it would be 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nHmm, that seems more plausible. Because if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and considering all terms, but perhaps the problem is intended to be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), that is, the term where \\(c\\) cancels out.\n\nWait, but the problem didn't specify \\(c^0\\), so I'm a bit confused. Let me try to see which interpretation makes more sense.\n\nIf I consider that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), then it's 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6*64=384.\n\nBut if it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it's 6*20=120.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is intended to have the term \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by \\(c^0\\), so the coefficient would be 120. Alternatively, maybe the problem is intended to just consider the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable, so the coefficient would be 6 times the entire second expansion, but that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think differently. The problem is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). When you multiply these two, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first expansion, and it's multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the sum of all the products of \\(6\\) (from the \\(a^2b^2\\) term) and each coefficient from the second expansion. So, that would be \\(6 \\times\\) (sum of coefficients in the second expansion).\n\nWait, but the sum of coefficients in the second expansion is 64, as I found earlier by setting \\(c=1\\). So, 6*64=384. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 384.\n\nBut wait, that would mean that the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each power of \\(c\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 384, but that's not correct because each term in the product would be \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^k\\) in the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) itself isn't a single number because it's multiplied by different powers of \\(c\\). So, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is the term where \\(c\\) is raised to the zero power.\n\nIn that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the constant term in the second expansion, which is 6*20=120.\n\nHmm, that seems more reasonable. Let me check that again.\n\nIn the second expansion, the constant term is 20. So, when I multiply the \\(6a^2b^2\\) term by 20, I get \\(120a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, specifically the term where \\(c^0\\) is multiplied, is 120.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then it's 6 times the entire second expansion, which would be a polynomial, but that's not a single coefficient. So, I think the intended interpretation is that the problem wants the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nWait, but let me make sure. Let me think about how the product works. Each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, resulting in terms like \\(6a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(6a^2b^2c^4\\), \\(6a^2b^2c^2\\), \\(6a^2b^2\\), \\(6a^2b^2c^{-2}\\), etc. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is 6*20=120, as I thought.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, considering only the constant term in \\(c\\), is 120.\n\nWait, but let me check the problem statement again: it says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\". It doesn't specify any power of \\(c\\), so perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, regardless of the power of \\(c\\). But in that case, the coefficient would be a sum of coefficients from each term in the product where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present, regardless of \\(c\\). But that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6*64=384.\n\nWait, but that would imply that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 384, but in reality, each term in the product would have different powers of \\(c\\), so \\(a^2b^2\\) is present in multiple terms with different \\(c\\) exponents. So, perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), which would be 384.\n\nBut I'm not entirely sure. Let me think again. If I consider the entire product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for each \\(k\\) would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^k\\) in the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) itself isn't a single number because it's part of multiple terms with different \\(c\\) exponents. So, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is intended to have the term \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by the entire second expansion, so the coefficient is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6*64=384.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of \\(c\\), so it's 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 384.\n\nBut I'm still a bit confused because usually, when a problem asks for the coefficient of a term in a product, it's considering all possible combinations, but in this case, since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), perhaps the coefficient is indeed 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion.\n\nWait, to clarify, let's think of the product as a polynomial in variables \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\), and \\(1/c\\). The term \\(a^2b^2\\) would appear in multiple terms in the product, each multiplied by a different power of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product isn't a single number because it's part of multiple terms. Therefore, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by the constant term in the second expansion.\n\nIn that case, the coefficient would be 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is intended to have the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without considering \\(c\\), which would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me check: when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a term in the product is the sum of the products of coefficients of terms whose variables add up to that term. So, for example, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) in the product is the sum over all \\(m\\) such that \\(6 - 2m = k\\) of \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}\\). So, for \\(a^2b^2\\), the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\) for all \\(m\\) such that \\(6 - 2m\\) is any integer, but since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), perhaps it's 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6*64=384.\n\nBut that seems to contradict the idea that each term in the product has a specific power of \\(c\\). So, perhaps the problem is intended to ask for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be 120.\n\nWait, but maybe I should look at the problem differently. Let me consider that the product is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). If I want the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I can think of it as the coefficient in the first part times the entire second part, but that's not correct because the second part is a separate variable.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is intended to be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating \\(c\\) as a variable, so the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\). But that seems unlikely because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try to think of it as follows: The term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion is 6a^2b^2. When I multiply this by the entire second expansion, each term in the second expansion will multiply this term, resulting in 6a^2b^2 multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the entire second expansion. But that would make the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient.\n\nTherefore, perhaps the problem is intended to ask for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is the term where \\(c\\) is to the zero power. So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the constant term in the second expansion, which is 20, so 6*20=120.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to have the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), meaning that it's 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6*64=384.\n\nBut I'm not sure. Let me try to see what the problem is asking again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" It doesn't specify any power of \\(c\\), so maybe it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times any power of \\(c\\), which would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 384.\n\nBut that seems a bit odd because the coefficient would then be a sum of coefficients from different terms. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to have the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nWait, perhaps I should look for similar problems or think about how the coefficients work in such products. When you have two separate variables, like \\(a, b\\) and \\(c\\), the terms in the product are combinations of the terms from each polynomial. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the sum of the coefficients of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for all \\(k\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a sum over all \\(k\\), which would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 384.\n\nBut wait, that's not correct because each term in the product is a unique combination, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is actually the sum of the coefficients of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for all \\(k\\), which is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 384.\n\nBut I'm still not entirely confident. Let me try to think of it another way. Suppose I set \\(a = 1\\), \\(b = 1\\), \\(c = 1\\). Then, the entire product would be \\((1 + 1)^4 \\times (1 + 1)^6 = 16 \\times 64 = 1024\\). But the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient when \\(a=1\\), \\(b=1\\), so it's 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6*64=384. So, if I set \\(a=1\\), \\(b=1\\), \\(c=1\\), the product is 1024, but the sum of all coefficients is 1024. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 384, which is part of that total.\n\nWait, but that seems to confirm that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 384.\n\nAlternatively, if I set \\(a=1\\), \\(b=1\\), \\(c=1\\), the product is 1024, and the sum of all coefficients is 1024. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 384, which is 6*64, as I thought earlier.\n\nTherefore, I think the correct answer is 384.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it might be 120. Now I'm getting confused again.\n\nWait, let me clarify. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. The product is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, when you expand this product, each term will be of the form \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}a^{4 - k}b^k \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k=2\\) in the first expansion, which gives \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}=6\\). Then, for each \\(m\\) in the second expansion, we have a term \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^{6 - 2m}\\) is \\(6 \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}\\). So, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then it's the sum over all \\(m\\) of \\(6 \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}\\), which is \\(6 \\times 2^6 = 6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\nBut if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then we need \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), so \\(m=3\\), and the coefficient is \\(6 \\times \\dbinom{6}{3} = 6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nSince the problem didn't specify the power of \\(c\\), I think the intended interpretation is that it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), which would be 384. But I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to have the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nWait, let me check the problem statement again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" It doesn't specify any power of \\(c\\), so perhaps it's intended to be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), which would be 384.\n\nBut I'm still not entirely confident. Let me think of an example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^1 \\times (c + 1/c)^1 = (a + b)(c + 1/c)\\). The coefficient of \\(a^1b^0\\) is \\(1 \\times (c + 1/c)\\), so it's a polynomial in \\(c\\). Similarly, the coefficient of \\(a^0b^1\\) is also \\(1 \\times (c + 1/c)\\). So, in that case, the coefficient of \\(a^1b^0\\) is not a single number but a polynomial.\n\nBut in our problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be a polynomial in \\(c\\). Therefore, perhaps the problem is intended to ask for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is a single number.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to have the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) as a polynomial in \\(c\\), but that seems unlikely because the problem just asks for the coefficient, implying a numerical value.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is intended to have the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating \\(c\\) as a variable, so the coefficient is 6 times the entire second expansion, which is a polynomial. But that doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a coefficient, which is a number.\n\nTherefore, I think the problem is intended to ask for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nWait, but let me check again. If I expand \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) separately, then multiply them, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first expansion, and it's multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6*64=384. But each term in the product has a different power of \\(c\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 384, but that's spread across different powers of \\(c\\). So, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), which is 384.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), it's 120.\n\nI think I need to make a decision here. Given that the problem didn't specify any power of \\(c\\), I think the intended answer is 384, which is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when considering all powers of \\(c\\). So, I'll go with that.\n\nBut just to make sure, let me think of it another way. If I consider the product as a polynomial in \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\), and \\(1/c\\), then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the sum of all coefficients where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any power of \\(c\\). So, that would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6*64=384.\n\nTherefore, I think the correct answer is 384.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it might be 120. Hmm, I'm going back and forth. Let me try to think of it as a generating function. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the sum over all \\(c\\) terms of the product of the coefficients. So, that would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 384.\n\nYes, I think that's correct. So, the answer is 384.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{384}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem to expand each part separately.\n\nFirst, we expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n\\]\nThe term containing \\(a^2b^2\\) is:\n\\[\n\\dbinom{4}{2} a^2 b^2 = 6a^2b^2\n\\]\n\nNext, we expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem:\n\\[\n\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n\\]\nThe sum of the coefficients in this expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives:\n\\[\n\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\n\\]\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient is:\n\\[\n6 \\times 64 = 384\n\\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{384}\\)."

Using the binomial theorem, this would be:\n\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\dbinom{4}{0}a^4 + \\dbinom{4}{1}a^3b + \\dbinom{4}{2}a^2b^2 + \\dbinom{4}{3}ab^3 + \\dbinom{4}{4}b^4\n\\]\n\nCalculating the coefficients:\n\n- \\(\\dbinom{4}{0} = 1\\)\n- \\(\\dbinom{4}{1} = 4\\)\n- \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\)\n- \\(\\dbinom{4}{3} = 4\\)\n- \\(\\dbinom{4}{4} = 1\\)\n\nSo, expanding it, we get:\n\n\\[\n1 \\cdot a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + 1 \\cdot b^4\n\\]\n\nOkay, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in this expansion is 6. But wait, the original problem is \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I need to consider the entire expression, not just \\((a + b)^4\\). That means I have to multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nBut the question is only asking about the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, when I multiply these two expressions together, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will come from multiplying the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in \\((a + b)^4\\) by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). However, since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), the terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) won't affect the powers of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression will just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, no, actually, when you multiply two polynomials, each term in one polynomial multiplies each term in the other. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), we can consider that it will be multiplied by every term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but since the variables are different, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will actually be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire sum of the coefficients of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, that doesn't sound right. Let me think again.\n\nActually, no. When you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first polynomial multiplies each term in the second polynomial. But since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are different variables, the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are only affected by the \\((a + b)^4\\) part, and the exponents of \\(c\\) are only affected by the \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) part. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be the product of the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from \\((a + b)^4\\) and every term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since the question is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\), that means we're looking for all possible terms in the product where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2 and 2, respectively, and the exponents of \\(c\\) can be anything. But wait, actually, no. Because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\). Wait, that can't be, because the entire expression includes \\(c\\). Hmm, maybe I misread the problem. Let me check again.\n\nWait, the problem says: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, actually, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term without any \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\). Therefore, when we multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will only come from multiplying the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in \\((a + b)^4\\) by the constant term (i.e., the term with \\(c^0\\)) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because if we multiply by any other term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which has positive or negative exponents of \\(c\\), it would introduce a \\(c\\) term into the product, making it \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2 \\cdot \\dfrac{1}{c^k}\\), which would not be just \\(a^2b^2\\). So, to get the term \\(a^2b^2\\), we need to multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by the constant term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nTherefore, the coefficient we're looking for is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nSo, first, we already found that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\nNow, we need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let's expand that using the binomial theorem as well.\n\nThe expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is:\n\n\\[\n\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} c^{-k} = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n\\]\n\nSo, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, because that's the constant term.\n\nSo, set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\):\n\n\\[\n6 - 2k = 0 \\implies 2k = 6 \\implies k = 3\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the constant term is when \\(k = 3\\):\n\n\\[\n\\dbinom{6}{3} c^{0} = \\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\n\\]\n\nSo, the constant term is 20.\n\nNow, going back to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) and the constant term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nSo, that's 6 multiplied by 20, which is 120.\n\nWait, let me double-check that. So, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. In \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the constant term is 20. So, when we multiply these two expressions, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by 20, giving a coefficient of 6 * 20 = 120. That seems correct.\n\nLet me make sure I didn't miss anything. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term without any \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\). So, yes, it's only affected by the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first part and the constant term in the second part. So, 6 * 20 = 120. That should be the answer.\n\nWait, just to be thorough, let me think if there's any other way this could be interpreted. For example, if the question had asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some specific \\(k\\), then we would have to consider other terms, but since it's just \\(a^2b^2\\), we're only interested in the constant term in the \\(c\\) part. So, I think 120 is correct.\n\nYeah, I think that's the right approach. So, the coefficient is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Multiplying these gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\boxed{120}"

But that doesn't make sense because the entire expansion is a polynomial in \\(c\\), so when you multiply, you'd get terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for various \\(k\\). \n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but it doesn't specify any particular power of \\(c\\). So, perhaps the answer is just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion, which doesn't make sense because the problem is likely expecting a numerical coefficient. \n\nWait, perhaps I misread the problem. Let me check again. It says, \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" Hmm, maybe I'm supposed to consider the entire expression and find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, that would mean that the coefficient is 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nBut wait, no, that's not right. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients of all terms in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times each term's coefficient contributes to the overall coefficient. But actually, no, because in the product, each term is a product of terms from each expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients of each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nWait, but that seems like it would give a very large number, and I don't think that's what the problem is asking. Maybe I need to think differently. Perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, in other words, the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would make the coefficient a polynomial in \\(c\\), not a numerical coefficient. \n\nWait, maybe the problem is expecting me to consider that when you multiply the two expansions, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion.

Hmm, that's confusing. Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try another approach. \n\nLet me consider that when you have two independent variables, \\(a, b\\) and \\(c\\), the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from those involving \\(c\\). So, when you multiply the two expressions, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), and it's multiplied by every term in the second expansion, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. \n\nBut that would mean the coefficient is 6 times a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. Therefore, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out to zero. That would make more sense because then we're looking for a specific term where the powers of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) multiply to give \\(c^0\\). \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, but that seems unlikely because the product would have multiple terms with \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by different powers of \\(c\\). So, perhaps the problem is expecting me to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. \n\nWait, but the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\). So, if I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the sum of all coefficients is 64. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nWait, but let me check that again. If I have \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. But if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then it would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is indeed 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nBut wait, I'm not sure if that's correct. Let me think again. Each term in the product is a product of a term from \\((a + b)^4\\) and a term from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first part, and it's multiplied by each term in the second part. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times each coefficient from the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nAlternatively, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out, then I would need to find the term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) where the exponent is zero. That would be the constant term. \n\nWait, that makes more sense. Because if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), without specifying \\(c\\), it's ambiguous. But perhaps the intended interpretation is that we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\). \n\nSo, let me try that approach. First, find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6. Then, find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). \n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), I can use the binomial theorem again. The expansion is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(1/c\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We want the exponent of \\(c\\) to be zero, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\). \n\nSo, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. \n\nNow, since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product, it's the product of the coefficients from each part. That is, 6 (from \\(a^2b^2\\)) multiplied by 20 (from \\(c^0\\)), which gives 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nWait, but earlier I thought the sum of coefficients was 64, but that was when considering all powers of \\(c\\). But if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), then it would be 6 * 64 = 384. However, if it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it's 120. \n\nI think the problem is more likely asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), because otherwise, the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense as a numerical answer. So, I'll go with 120 as the coefficient. \n\nLet me double-check. \n\nFirst, \\((a + b)^4\\) has \\(a^2b^2\\) with coefficient 6. \n\nThen, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) has a constant term (i.e., \\(c^0\\)) with coefficient \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). \n\nTherefore, when you multiply these two parts, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by the constant term 20 from the second part, resulting in a coefficient of 6 * 20 = 120 for the term \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). \n\nYes, that makes sense. So, the coefficient is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. To find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we consider the term where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out, i.e., \\(c^0\\). \n\nUsing the binomial theorem, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying this by 6 gives the final coefficient.\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is 120.\n\n\\boxed{120}"

So, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term is just part of the first part, but then it's multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part, which is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nHmm, so I think I need to consider that the entire expression is the product of two expansions: one in terms of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the other in terms of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 multiplied by the sum of all the terms in the second expansion, right? Because when you multiply \\(6a^2b^2\\) by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be 6 times whatever the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion is. \n\nWait, but no, that doesn't sound quite right. Let me think again. Actually, when you multiply two polynomials together, each term from the first polynomial gets multiplied by each term from the second polynomial. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because the \\(a^2b^2\\) term is only affected by the coefficient 6 from the first part, and then it gets multiplied by each term in the second part, which could have different powers of \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, actually, the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but since we're just looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), that might not be the case. \n\nWait, no, that's not correct. Let me clarify. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when you expand this, each term from the first expansion (which has \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms) gets multiplied by each term from the second expansion (which has \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) terms). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\), we need to consider that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is just 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nBut wait, that seems a bit confusing. Let me think differently. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), and when we multiply it by the second part, which is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because each term in the second expansion is a coefficient times a power of \\(c\\), and when you multiply by 6, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. \n\nBut wait, the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) can be found by setting \\(c = 1\\). Because when \\(c = 1\\), each term becomes just its coefficient. So, let's compute \\(\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = (2)^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 times 64, which is 384. \n\nWait, but that seems too straightforward. Let me check again. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part has a coefficient of 6, and when multiplied by the entire second part, which is a polynomial in \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times each term in the second expansion. But since the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\), the coefficient would indeed be 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part, which is 6 times 64, so 384. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I should think of it as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the product of the coefficients of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and the coefficient of 1 (i.e., the constant term) in the second part. Wait, no, that's not correct because the second part isn't a constant; it's a polynomial in \\(c\\). So, actually, when you multiply \\(6a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, each term will have a different power of \\(c\\), but the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the sum of all the coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by 6. \n\nWait, no, that's not quite right either. Because each term in the product will have both \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms and \\(c\\) terms. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part, but since the second part is a polynomial, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times each coefficient of the terms in the second expansion, but that doesn't make sense because the second expansion doesn't have any \\(a\\) or \\(b\\) terms. \n\nWait, I think I'm getting confused. Let me try to approach this differently. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when you expand this, each term will be of the form \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}a^{4 - k}b^k \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - m}\\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\), where \\(k\\) and \\(m\\) range from 0 to 4 and 0 to 6, respectively. \n\nSimplifying the second part: \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - m}c^{-m} = \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\). \n\nSo, each term in the product is \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}\\dbinom{6}{m}a^{4 - k}b^k c^{6 - 2m}\\). \n\nNow, we are interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, we need to find all terms where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2 and 2, respectively. That means \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). So, \\(k = 2\\), and the coefficient from the first part is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). \n\nNow, since the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are fixed, we just need to consider the terms in the second expansion \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) that are multiplied by this 6. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. \n\nWait, but that's not correct because the second expansion isn't just a constant; it's a polynomial in \\(c\\). So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the entire expansion of the second part, but that doesn't make sense because the second part isn't a constant. \n\nWait, no, I think I'm mixing up things. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) is from the first part, and it's being multiplied by each term in the second part. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times each term in the second expansion, but since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. \n\nWait, but the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion is when \\(c = 1\\), which is \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nBut let me think again. When you have two separate variables, \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) in one part and \\(c\\) in the other, the coefficients in one part don't affect the variables in the other. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire second expansion. But since we're only interested in the coefficient, not the entire term, it's 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I should think of it as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the product of the coefficients of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and the coefficient of any term in the second part, but that doesn't seem right because the second part is a separate variable. \n\nWait, perhaps the confusion arises because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in the product, each term is of the form \\(a^{4 - k}b^k c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) occurs when \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\), regardless of the value of \\(m\\). So, for each \\(m\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\). \n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) multiplied by the sum over all \\(m\\) of \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\). \n\nWait, but that's not quite right. Because each term in the product is \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}\\dbinom{6}{m}a^{4 - k}b^k c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, for \\(a^2b^2\\), we have \\(k = 2\\), and \\(4 - k = 2\\), so the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) times the sum over all \\(m\\) of \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\). \n\nBut the sum over all \\(m\\) of \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\) is just \\(2^6 = 64\\). So, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). \n\nWait, but I'm not sure if that's correct because the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is being multiplied by each term in the second expansion, which includes different powers of \\(c\\). But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), the coefficient would indeed be the product of the coefficients from each part. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I should think of it as the entire product is a polynomial in \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the sum over all possible terms where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2, regardless of the exponent of \\(c\\). \n\nSo, in other words, for each term in the product, if it has \\(a^2b^2\\), then its coefficient would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) times \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\) for some \\(m\\). But since \\(m\\) can be anything from 0 to 6, the total coefficient would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) times the sum over \\(m\\) of \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\). \n\nBut the sum over \\(m\\) of \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\) is \\(2^6 = 64\\), so the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). \n\nWait, but let me check with a smaller example to see if this makes sense. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, expanding this, we have:\n\nFirst, \\((a + b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2\\).\n\nSecond, \\((c + 1/c)^1 = c + 1/c\\).\n\nMultiplying them together, we get:\n\n\\(a^2(c + 1/c) + 2ab(c + 1/c) + b^2(c + 1/c)\\).\n\nSo, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't exist in this product because each term from the first expansion is multiplied by terms in \\(c\\), but there's no \\(b\\) in the second expansion. So, in this case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 0. \n\nWait, but according to my earlier logic, the coefficient would be \\(\\dbinom{2}{1}\\) times the sum of coefficients in the second expansion. \\(\\dbinom{2}{1} = 2\\), and the sum of coefficients in the second expansion is \\(2^1 = 2\\), so 2 * 2 = 4. But in reality, there is no \\(a^2b^2\\) term, so the coefficient is 0. Therefore, my earlier logic must be wrong. \n\nHmm, that's a problem. So, my approach must be incorrect. Let me try to figure out where I went wrong. \n\nIn the smaller example, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 0 because the product doesn't have any \\(b\\) terms in the second expansion, so you can't get a \\(b^2\\) term unless you multiply \\(b^2\\) from the first expansion by something, but the second expansion only has \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), so \\(b^2\\) times \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\) just gives terms with \\(b^2c\\) or \\(b^2/c\\), but not \\(a^2b^2\\). \n\nWait, but in the original problem, the second expansion is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\). So, in the product, each term will have either \\(a\\) or \\(b\\) from the first expansion and some power of \\(c\\) from the second expansion. Therefore, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) can only come from the first expansion, and when multiplied by the second expansion, it's just \\(a^2b^2\\) times each term in the second expansion. But since the second expansion doesn't have any \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will just be \\(a^2b^2\\) times each term in the second expansion. \n\nWait, but that means that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion multiplied by the entire second expansion. So, the coefficient would be 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that can't be right because the coefficient should be a number, not a polynomial. \n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question. It says, \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\" in the entire product. But in the product, each term has both \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms and \\(c\\) terms. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by various powers of \\(c\\), but the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the sum of all the coefficients from the second expansion, because each term in the second expansion is a coefficient times a power of \\(c\\), and when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the sum of all those coefficients. \n\nWait, that makes sense. Because when you have \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by, say, \\(c^6\\), the coefficient is 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^6\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{6}{0} = 1\\). Similarly, when multiplied by \\(c^4\\), the coefficient is 6 times \\(\\dbinom{6}{1} = 6\\), and so on. So, the total coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. \n\nBut in the smaller example, \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be \\(\\dbinom{2}{1}\\) times the sum of coefficients in the second expansion, which is 2 * 2 = 4, but in reality, there is no \\(a^2b^2\\) term because you can't get \\(b^2\\) from the second expansion. So, that contradicts my earlier conclusion. \n\nWait, but in the smaller example, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't exist because the second expansion doesn't have any \\(b\\) terms, so the coefficient is zero. Therefore, my approach must be incorrect. \n\nWait, perhaps I need to consider that the second expansion doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is just the same as in the first expansion, which is 6, because the second expansion is multiplied by each term, but since it's separate variables, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) remains 6. \n\nBut that can't be right either because when you multiply by the second expansion, each term from the first expansion is scaled by each term from the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nBut in the smaller example, that would give 2 * 2 = 4, but in reality, the coefficient is 0 because you can't have \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. So, my logic must be flawed. \n\nWait, perhaps the key is that in the smaller example, the second expansion doesn't have any \\(b\\) terms, so you can't get \\(b^2\\) in the product. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is zero. So, in the original problem, the second expansion is in \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), which don't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is just the same as in the first expansion, which is 6. \n\nWait, but that seems too simple. Let me think again. The product is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Each term in the product is a term from the first expansion times a term from the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the first expansion, and when multiplied by any term from the second expansion, it's just \\(a^2b^2\\) times some power of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the same as in the first expansion, which is 6, because the second expansion is just scaling each term, but not affecting the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) exponents. \n\nWait, but that can't be right because when you multiply by the second expansion, you're effectively scaling each term in the first expansion by each term in the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the entire second expansion, which is a polynomial, but the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term, not a polynomial. \n\nI'm getting confused here. Maybe I should approach it differently. Let me think of the entire expression as a product of two polynomials: one in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the other in \\(c\\). So, when you multiply them, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the same as in the first polynomial, because the second polynomial doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is just 6. \n\nBut wait, that seems too simple, and it contradicts the earlier logic. Let me test it with the smaller example. \n\nIn the smaller example, \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be zero because there's no \\(b^2\\) term in the second expansion. But according to this logic, the coefficient would be \\(\\dbinom{2}{1} = 2\\), but in reality, it's zero. So, that logic must be wrong. \n\nWait, perhaps the confusion is that the second expansion doesn't have \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), so when you multiply, the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) is if both \\(a^2\\) and \\(b^2\\) come from the first expansion, and the second expansion just scales them. But in reality, the second expansion doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is just the same as in the first expansion, which is 6. \n\nWait, but in the smaller example, the coefficient would be 2, but in reality, there is no \\(a^2b^2\\) term because the second expansion doesn't have any \\(b\\) terms. So, I'm still confused. \n\nMaybe the key is that since the second expansion doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion, which is 6, multiplied by the entire second expansion. But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term, not a polynomial, it's just 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion. \n\nWait, but in the smaller example, that would be 2 times 2 = 4, but the actual coefficient is zero. So, that must not be correct. \n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think of it this way: the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, because the second part doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\). So, the coefficient remains 6. \n\nBut that seems too simple, and it contradicts the earlier logic. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I should think of the entire expression as a product of two polynomials, and the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just the product of the coefficients of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial and the constant term in the second polynomial. But the second polynomial isn't a constant; it's \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which doesn't have a constant term unless \\(c^0\\) is considered. \n\nWait, let me compute the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). The general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - m}(1/c)^m = \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the constant term occurs when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which is when \\(m = 3\\). So, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). \n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the constant term in the second part. So, that's 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nWait, that makes more sense. Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by the constant term 20, you get 20a^2b^2, so the coefficient is 20 * 6 = 120. \n\nBut in the smaller example, the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^1\\) is when \\(m = 0.5\\), which isn't possible because \\(m\\) must be an integer. So, there is no constant term, which means the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be zero, which matches the reality. \n\nSo, in the original problem, the constant term in the second expansion is 20, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nWait, that seems more plausible. Let me confirm. \n\nIn the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. In the second part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the constant term (i.e., the term with \\(c^0\\)) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, when you multiply these two, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nYes, that makes sense because the only way to get a term that's purely \\(a^2b^2\\) (without any \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\)) is to multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first expansion by the constant term from the second expansion. All other terms would have a power of \\(c\\) attached, so they wouldn't be purely \\(a^2b^2\\). \n\nTherefore, the coefficient is 120. \n\nWait, but earlier I thought it might be 384, but that was when considering all coefficients in the second expansion. But now, considering only the constant term, it's 120. \n\nLet me verify this with another approach. Let me compute the product step by step. \n\nFirst, expand \\((a + b)^4\\) to get \\(a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). \n\nNext, expand \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - m}(1/c)^m = \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\). \n\nSo, the expansion is:\n\n- \\(m=0\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{0}c^6 = 1 \\cdot c^6\\)\n- \\(m=1\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{1}c^4 = 6c^4\\)\n- \\(m=2\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{2}c^2 = 15c^2\\)\n- \\(m=3\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}c^0 = 20\\)\n- \\(m=4\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{4}c^{-2} = 15c^{-2}\\)\n- \\(m=5\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{5}c^{-4} = 6c^{-4}\\)\n- \\(m=6\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{6}c^{-6} = 1c^{-6}\\)\n\nSo, the expansion is \\(c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15c^{-2} + 6c^{-4} + c^{-6}\\).\n\nNow, when we multiply this by \\((a + b)^4\\), each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) gets multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion gets multiplied by each term in the second expansion, resulting in:\n\n- \\(6a^2b^2 \\cdot c^6\\)\n- \\(6a^2b^2 \\cdot 6c^4 = 36a^2b^2c^4\\)\n- \\(6a^2b^2 \\cdot 15c^2 = 90a^2b^2c^2\\)\n- \\(6a^2b^2 \\cdot 20 = 120a^2b^2\\)\n- \\(6a^2b^2 \\cdot 15c^{-2} = 90a^2b^2c^{-2}\\)\n- \\(6a^2b^2 \\cdot 6c^{-4} = 36a^2b^2c^{-4}\\)\n- \\(6a^2b^2 \\cdot c^{-6} = 6a^2b^2c^{-6}\\)\n\nSo, among these terms, the only one that is purely \\(a^2b^2\\) (without any \\(c\\) terms) is \\(120a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 120. \n\nTherefore, the answer is 120. \n\nI think this makes sense now. The key was to recognize that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient from the first expansion multiplied by the constant term from the second expansion because only the constant term doesn't introduce any \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\) factors, thus leaving the term as \\(a^2b^2\\). All other terms would have additional powers of \\(c\\), so they wouldn't contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) alone. \n\nSo, the final answer is 120.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem for both parts.\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\):**\n   Using the binomial theorem:\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term with \\(a^2b^2\\) is when \\(k = 2\\):\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2}a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\n   \\]\n   So, the coefficient is 6.\n\n2. **Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   Using the binomial theorem:\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - m}\\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\n   \\]\n   The constant term (where \\(c^0\\)) occurs when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which is \\(m = 3\\):\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\n   \\]\n\n3. **Combine the results:**\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the product of the coefficients from each part:\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 20 = 120\n   \\]\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

    "text": " \n\nWait, but the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). That means I need to find the term where \\(a\\) is squared and \\(b\\) is squared. So, in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\), what's the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)? Let me think. The general term in the expansion is \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\\). So, if I set \\(4 - k = 2\\), then \\(k = 2\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Let me calculate that: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\nBut wait, the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Does that affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)? Hmm, because when you multiply two expressions, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), right? Or wait, no, that's not quite right. Because we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is in the first part, and the second part is in terms of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, actually, since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), the coefficients from the second part won't affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, does that mean the coefficient remains 6? Or am I missing something?\n\nWait, no, I think I'm confusing something. Because when you multiply two expressions together, each term in the first expression is multiplied by each term in the second. So, if I have \\( (a + b)^4 = \\text{terms involving } a \\text{ and } b \\) and \\( \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\text{terms involving } c \\text{ and } 1/c \\), then when I multiply them, the variables are all separate. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term from the second part, which are in terms of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, that means I need to consider how many times \\(a^2b^2\\) appears in the product. \n\nWait, no, actually, no. Because \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), so when I multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each of those will give me terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2 \\dfrac{1}{c^k}\\), but since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term without \\(c\\), I think that term only comes from multiplying \\(a^2b^2\\) by the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 times the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nSo, now I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me expand that using the binomial theorem. The general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, the exponent of \\(c\\) is \\(6 - 2k\\). We need this exponent to be zero for the term to be constant. So, set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Let me compute that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20.\n\nTherefore, going back to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the constant term in the second part), which gives 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, let me just make sure I didn't make a mistake here. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, correct? Yes, because \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). And the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is when \\(k = 3\\), which gives \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, 6 * 20 = 120. That seems right. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of it as the entire product being \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), and since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is independent of \\(c\\), we can separate the two parts. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20, so when you multiply these two coefficients together, you get 120. Yeah, that makes sense.\n\nI think that's the correct approach. So, the coefficient is 120.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we first determine the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem, which is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Next, we find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which occurs when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. This happens at \\(k = 3\\), giving the term \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying these coefficients together, we get \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\boxed{120}"

    "text": " \n\nAlright, so let's start with the first part: \\((a + b)^4\\). Using the binomial theorem, the expansion will be \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\\). I need to find the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2, which means \\(a^2b^2\\). So, I need to find the value of \\(k\\) such that \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). That makes sense because \\(4 - 2 = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). \n\nSo, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Let me calculate that: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient is 6. \n\nNow, the original expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I notice that the second part is another binomial expression, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which only involves \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), the terms from the second part will multiply each term from the first expansion. However, since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), the part involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) will just be a constant multiplier for that specific term. \n\nWait, let me think about that again. When we multiply two expressions, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. But since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term from the first part, and the second part is entirely in terms of \\(c\\), when we multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by any term from the second expansion, it will just be \\(a^2b^2\\) times some coefficient and some power of \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\), right? Or does it? Wait, no, the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product. But in the product, \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term from the second expansion, so the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) will be the sum of all the coefficients from the second expansion, because each term from the second expansion will be multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). \n\nWait, no, that doesn't sound right. Let me clarify. If I have \\((a + b)^4\\) expanded as terms like \\(a^4, a^3b, a^2b^2, ab^3, b^4\\), each multiplied by their respective coefficients, and then I multiply that by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is a sum of terms involving powers of \\(c\\). So, when I multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product will actually be \\(6 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that's a term involving \\(c\\), not a constant. Wait, but the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, does that mean we're considering the entire expression as a polynomial in \\(a, b, c\\), and we're looking for the coefficient of the term \\(a^2b^2\\) times any power of \\(c\\)? Or are we supposed to consider the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which would include all the coefficients from the second part? \n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again. The problem is: What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, in the product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product will actually be \\(6 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that's not a constant; it's a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so perhaps it's expecting a numerical coefficient, treating \\(c\\) as another variable. But that wouldn't make sense because the coefficient would depend on \\(c\\). Alternatively, maybe the problem is only considering the part of the product that doesn't involve \\(c\\), but that's not clear. \n\nWait, perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, in other words, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by any combination of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, the coefficient would be \\(6 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that's not a number, it's an expression. So, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, considering all possible powers of \\(c\\), so the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that seems odd. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, so the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that's not quite right either. \n\nWait, perhaps the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, if we think of the product as a polynomial in \\(a, b, c\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) can appear with different powers of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient for each such term would be 6 times the corresponding coefficient from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), without specifying any particular power of \\(c\\). So, perhaps the answer is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but that doesn't make sense because the sum of coefficients is when you set \\(c = 1\\), which would give \\(2^6 = 64\\). So, 6 times 64 would be 384, but that seems too large. \n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try a different approach. The problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second part. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the entire second part, which is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is \\(6 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial in \\(c\\), not a constant. So, perhaps the problem is expecting a numerical coefficient, but that doesn't make sense because \\(c\\) is a variable. \n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the question. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, perhaps it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in other words, the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial. But that seems odd because coefficients are usually constants. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, considering all possible powers of \\(c\\), so the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But the sum of the coefficients is when \\(c = 1\\), which is \\(2^6 = 64\\), so 6 * 64 = 384. But I'm not sure if that's the correct interpretation. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, so the coefficient would be 6 times the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that's not a number, it's an expression. So, maybe I'm missing something here. \n\nWait, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\). That would make sense because then we can find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when the power of \\(c\\) is zero. So, in that case, we would need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), and then multiply it by 6. \n\nLet me try that approach. So, first, find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(1/c\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be zero, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). \n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6*6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). \n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire product is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the second part), which is 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nWait, but the problem didn't specify \\(c^0\\), it just asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, maybe I'm supposed to consider all possible powers of \\(c\\), but that would mean the coefficient is \\(6 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial. But that doesn't seem right because coefficients are usually constants. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, regardless of \\(c\\), so the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but that's not a number. So, maybe the intended interpretation is that we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be 120. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which would be 6 times the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but that's not a single number. So, perhaps the problem is expecting 6 times the sum of the coefficients of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384, as I thought earlier. But I'm not sure. \n\nWait, maybe I should check what the problem is asking. It says: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\)?\" So, it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but since the expression also involves \\(c\\), the coefficient will be a polynomial in \\(c\\). So, perhaps the answer is \\(6 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that seems too involved. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, so the coefficient is \\(6 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that's a polynomial, not a number. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, which would be the sum of all coefficients from the second part, but that doesn't make sense because each term in the second part is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be \\(6 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). \n\nWait, but that's not a number. So, perhaps the problem is expecting the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when considering \\(c\\) as a variable, which would mean that the coefficient is \\(6 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that's not a single number, so maybe the problem is expecting the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be 120. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and ignoring the second part, but that seems unlikely because the second part is part of the product. \n\nWait, let me think again. When you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum of the products of the coefficients of terms whose variables add up to that term. So, in this case, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the sum of all coefficients from the second part multiplied by 6. But that would mean the coefficient is 6 times the sum of the coefficients of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). The sum of the coefficients is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), so \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient would be 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nBut wait, that would mean the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 384, but that seems high. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), so it's 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial. But that's not a number. \n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let's try to see what the problem is asking. It says: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\)?\" So, in the product, \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is \\(6 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that's a polynomial in \\(c\\), not a constant. So, perhaps the problem is expecting the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, so the coefficient is \\(6 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\).

But that's not a single number. \n\nWait, maybe the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and the second part is just a constant factor. But that doesn't make sense because the second part is a binomial expression that expands into multiple terms. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which would be 6 times the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that's a polynomial, not a number. \n\nWait, I think I'm missing something here. Let me try to approach this differently. Let's consider the entire product as a product of two independent binomial expansions. So, \\((a + b)^4\\) expands to terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) expands to terms involving \\(c\\). So, when we multiply them together, each term from the first expansion is multiplied by each term from the second expansion. \n\nSo, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion is multiplied by each term from the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be \\(6 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that's a polynomial, not a number. So, perhaps the problem is expecting the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which is \\(6 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). \n\nBut the problem is asking for the coefficient, which is usually a constant. So, perhaps the problem is expecting the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when considering \\(c\\) as a variable, which would mean that the coefficient is \\(6 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that's not a number. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, considering all possible powers of \\(c\\), so the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). The sum of the coefficients is when \\(c = 1\\), which is \\(2^6 = 64\\). So, 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nBut wait, that would mean the coefficient is 384, but that seems high. Let me check: \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) when \\(c = 1\\) is indeed \\(2^6 = 64\\). So, 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nBut is that the correct interpretation? The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so if we set \\(c = 1\\), we're effectively looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product when \\(c = 1\\), which would be 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of \\(c\\), so the coefficient is 6 times the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that's a polynomial, not a number. \n\nWait, perhaps the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and the second part is just a constant factor. But that doesn't make sense because the second part is a binomial expression that expands into multiple terms. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which would be 6 times the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that's a polynomial, not a number. \n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again. The problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, in the product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term from the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that's a polynomial, not a number. So, perhaps the problem is expecting the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which is \\(6 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). \n\nBut the problem is asking for the coefficient, which is usually a constant. So, perhaps the problem is expecting the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating \\(c\\) as a variable, so the coefficient is \\(6 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that's a polynomial, not a number. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, considering all possible powers of \\(c\\), so the coefficient is 6 times the sum of the coefficients of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). As I calculated earlier, the sum of the coefficients is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nBut I'm not sure if that's the intended interpretation. Let me check another way. If I consider the product \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), and I want the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), that would be the same as taking the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and multiplying it by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient would be 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). \n\nBut that's a polynomial, not a number. So, perhaps the problem is expecting the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which is \\(6 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). \n\nWait, but the problem is asking for the coefficient, which is usually a number. So, perhaps the problem is expecting the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when considering \\(c\\) as a variable, which would mean that the coefficient is \\(6 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\).

But that's a polynomial, not a number. \n\nWait, I think I'm stuck here. Let me try to summarize. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), with a coefficient of 6. The second part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), when expanded, will have terms involving different powers of \\(c\\). When we multiply the two expansions together, each term from the first part is multiplied by each term from the second part. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term from the second part, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for various \\(k\\). \n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that's a polynomial, not a single number. So, perhaps the problem is expecting the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which is \\(6 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). \n\nBut the problem is asking for the coefficient, which is usually a number. So, perhaps the problem is expecting the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, considering all possible powers of \\(c\\), which would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of the coefficients of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). As I calculated earlier, the sum of the coefficients is \\(2^6 = 64\\), so 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nBut I'm not entirely sure if that's the correct interpretation. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which is \\(6 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). \n\nWait, but the problem didn't specify any particular power of \\(c\\), so perhaps the answer is \\(6 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\).

So, perhaps the problem is expecting the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which is \\(6 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). \n\nBut I'm stuck between two interpretations: either the coefficient is 6 times the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) or 6 times the sum of the coefficients, which is 384. \n\nWait, perhaps I should look at similar problems. For example, if you have \\((a + b)^n \\times (c + d)^m\\), the coefficient of \\(a^kb^{n - k}\\) in the product is \\(\\dbinom{n}{k} \\times \\dbinom{m}{l}\\) where \\(l\\) is the exponent for \\(d\\). But in this case, the second part is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is similar to \\((c + d)^6\\) where \\(d = 1/c\\). \n\nSo, if we think of the product as \\((a + b)^4 \\times (c + 1/c)^6\\), then the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is in the first part, and in the second part, each term is \\(c^{6 - k} \\times (1/c)^k = c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the sum over all \\(k\\) of the coefficients from the second part. But that's not quite right because each term in the second part is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). \n\nBut that's a polynomial, not a number.

It says: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, it's possible that the problem is expecting the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which is 6 times the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\).

Using the binomial theorem, I can expand this as:\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\dbinom{4}{0}a^4b^0 + \\dbinom{4}{1}a^3b^1 + \\dbinom{4}{2}a^2b^2 + \\dbinom{4}{3}a^1b^3 + \\dbinom{4}{4}a^0b^4\n\\]\nCalculating the coefficients:\n- \\(\\dbinom{4}{0} = 1\\)\n- \\(\\dbinom{4}{1} = 4\\)\n- \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\)\n- \\(\\dbinom{4}{3} = 4\\)\n- \\(\\dbinom{4}{4} = 1\\)\n\nSo, expanding it, we get:\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\n\\]\nAlright, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in this part is 6. But wait, the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I need to consider that as well.\n\nNow, I remember that when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficients multiply term by term. So, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since the problem only asks for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I might not need to consider all the terms, just the ones that contribute to \\(a^2b^2\\).\n\nWait, actually, hold on. The variables in the two parts are different: the first part has \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the second part has \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, when I multiply them, the variables \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are all distinct. That means that the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part will be multiplied by every term in the second part, but since the second part doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression will just be the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. But wait, that doesn't seem right because the second part has terms with different powers of \\(c\\), but the first part has a fixed power of \\(a^2b^2\\). \n\nWait, no, actually, no. Let me think again. When you multiply two expressions, each term in the first expression is multiplied by each term in the second expression. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which will give terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) where \\(k\\) ranges from -6 to 6 in steps of 2, I think. But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, in the entire product, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) will be the coefficient from the first part, 6, multiplied by the entire second part, because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, the resulting terms will have \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by some power of \\(c\\). But the problem is only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). Wait, no, that's not correct because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression. But since the entire expression includes terms with different powers of \\(c\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will actually appear in multiple terms in the expanded product, each multiplied by a different power of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but that doesn't make sense because the coefficient is a number, not a polynomial.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the question. It says, \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in other words, in the entire expansion, collect all the terms that have \\(a^2b^2\\) and sum their coefficients. Each such term will be of the form \\(a^2b^2 \\times \\text{something with } c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the sum of all coefficients from the second part, because each term in the second part multiplies the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\).\n\nWait, but the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 * 64 = 384. But I'm not sure if that's correct. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it.\n\nLet me think again. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\), and its coefficient is 6. Then, when you multiply by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which expands to a sum of terms, each of those terms will multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is indeed \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\), so 6 * 64 = 384. Therefore, the coefficient is 384.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. Alternatively, maybe the question is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some specific \\(k\\), but the problem doesn't specify a particular power of \\(c\\), it's just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in that case, yes, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6*64=384.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem had asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then we would have to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion, which is the middle term. But since it's just \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\), it's 6 times the entire sum of coefficients in the second part, which is 6*64=384.\n\nWait, but let me think again. When you have \\((a + b)^4\\) times \\((c + 1/c)^6\\), the variables are independent, so when you expand, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, which includes terms like \\(c^6\\), \\(6c^4\\), \\(15c^2\\), \\(20\\), \\(15c^{-2}\\), \\(6c^{-4}\\), and \\(c^{-6}\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the sum of all these coefficients multiplied by 6. So, that would be 6*(1 + 6 + 15 + 20 + 15 + 6 + 1) = 6*(64) = 384.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So, the coefficient is 384.\n\nWait, but let me confirm. Alternatively, maybe I should consider that the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is only from the first part, and the second part is multiplied as a whole, so the coefficient is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion. Since the sum of coefficients is found by plugging in c=1, which gives 2^6=64, so 6*64=384. Therefore, the answer is 384.\n\nI think that's correct. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 384.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break it down as follows:\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\n   \\]\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) here is 6.\n\n2. **Consider the second part \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   When multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), each term in this expansion will contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the final product. The sum of the coefficients in this expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\):\n   \\[\n   (1 + 1)^6 = 64\n   \\]\n\n3. **Multiply the coefficients:**\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the two coefficients:\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 64 = 384\n   \\]\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{384}."

So, I need to consider how that multiplication affects the term \\(a^2b^2\\).\n\nHmm, but actually, since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), maybe the other part \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) doesn't affect the powers of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\).

But wait, that can't be right because the problem is asking for a coefficient, which is a number, not an expression with \\(c\\) terms. So, maybe I'm misunderstanding something.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think again. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when you multiply two expressions together, the terms multiply. So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I need to consider all the terms in the expansion where the power of \\(a\\) is 2 and the power of \\(b\\) is 2, regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). But since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), the coefficients involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are independent of those involving \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't make sense because the coefficient should be a number, not a polynomial in \\(c\\). \n\nWait, maybe I'm misinterpreting the problem. Perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion of the entire expression, which would include all the \\(c\\) terms. But that would mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually be a polynomial in \\(c\\). However, the problem just asks for the coefficient, so maybe it's expecting a numerical coefficient, which would imply that we're considering terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by some power of \\(c\\), but since \\(c\\) is another variable, perhaps the problem is actually only considering the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. But that seems odd because the coefficient would then just be 6, as in \\((a + b)^4\\), but that doesn't involve the other part.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is written as \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), and we're to consider the product as a single expression, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, not a single number. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times a specific power of \\(c\\), but it's not specified. Wait, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me check the problem again.\n\nThe problem says: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" Hmm, so it's possible that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, meaning that the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that seems unlikely because the coefficient is usually a scalar. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some \\(k\\), but it's not specified. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only considering the terms where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2 each, and the exponents of \\(c\\) can be anything, but the coefficient would then be a sum over all possible \\(c\\) terms. But that's not standard. \n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think differently. Maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would make the coefficient a polynomial in \\(c\\), which seems unusual. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), meaning the constant term in \\(c\\). So, perhaps I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nThat makes more sense. So, to clarify, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, which would involve multiplying by the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, let me break it down:\n\n1. First, find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6.\n2. Then, find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) (the constant term) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n3. Multiply these two coefficients together to get the final coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product.\n\nOkay, that seems plausible. So, let's proceed with that approach.\n\nFirst, as established, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\nNext, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me expand this using the binomial theorem as well. The expansion is:\n\n\\[\n\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n\\]\n\nWe need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so we set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get:\n\n\\[\n6 - 2k = 0 \\implies 2k = 6 \\implies k = 3\n\\]\n\nSo, the term where \\(k = 3\\) is the constant term. The coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\).\n\nCalculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20.\n\nNow, since the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6 and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is the product of these two coefficients, which is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. Is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product equal to the product of the coefficients from each part? Let me think. When you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. So, if I have a term \\(6a^2b^2\\) from \\((a + b)^4\\) and I multiply it by the constant term \\(20\\) from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), I get \\(6 \\times 20 a^2b^2 = 120a^2b^2\\). So, yes, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is indeed 120.\n\nAlternatively, if I consider that the entire expression is a product of two independent expansions, then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) would be 6 times 20, which is 120. So, that makes sense.\n\nWait, but just to be thorough, let me consider another approach. Maybe I can think of the entire expression as a product and consider how the terms combine. So, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, for the term \\(a^2b^2\\), it comes from the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, we need to sum over all possible \\(c\\) terms. But that's not correct because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would actually be a polynomial in \\(c\\). However, the problem might be implying that we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), i.e., the constant term with respect to \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 6 times 20, giving 120.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, then the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which would make the coefficient a polynomial. But that seems unlikely because the problem is asking for a specific coefficient, which is usually a scalar.\n\nSo, given that, I think the intended interpretation is that we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where \\(a\\) is squared, \\(b\\) is squared, and \\(c\\) is to the zero power. Therefore, the coefficient would be 6 times 20, which is 120.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculation for the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The expansion is:\n\n\\[\n\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n\\]\n\nWe set the exponent equal to zero:\n\n\\[\n6 - 2k = 0 \\implies k = 3\n\\]\n\nSo, the term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} c^{0}\\), which is 20. So, that's correct.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 times 20, which is 120.\n\nWait, but just to be absolutely sure, let me consider an alternative approach. Let's consider the entire product:\n\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\left(\\sum_{i=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{i} a^{4 - i}b^i\\right) \\times \\left(\\sum_{j=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{j} c^{6 - j} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^j\\right)\n\\]\n\nWhich simplifies to:\n\n\\[\n\\left(\\sum_{i=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{i} a^{4 - i}b^i\\right) \\times \\left(\\sum_{j=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{j} c^{6 - 2j}\\right)\n\\]\n\nNow, when we multiply these two sums, each term in the first sum is multiplied by each term in the second sum. So, the term \\(a^{4 - i}b^i\\) is multiplied by \\(c^{6 - 2j}\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) occurs when \\(4 - i = 2\\) and \\(i = 2\\). So, that's when \\(i = 2\\), which gives us the coefficient \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n\nNow, for each such term, it's multiplied by the corresponding \\(c^{6 - 2j}\\) terms. But since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), the coefficient would actually be a sum over all possible \\(c\\) terms. But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a coefficient, which is a scalar. Therefore, the problem must be asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), i.e., the constant term in \\(c\\).\n\nSo, to get the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), we need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which we already found as 6 and 20, respectively. Multiplying these together gives 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is 120.\n\nWait, but let me just make sure I didn't miss anything. Is there another way this could be interpreted? For example, if the problem had said the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^2\\), that would be a different calculation, but since it's just \\(a^2b^2\\), I think the correct interpretation is that we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times the constant term in \\(c\\), which is 120.\n\nYes, I think that's correct. So, the final answer is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Multiplying these gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\boxed{120}"

    "text": " \n\nLet me start with the first part: \\((a + b)^4\\). Using the binomial theorem, the expansion will be \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\\). I need the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2, right? So, I guess I need to find the term where \\(a^2b^2\\). Let me think, if \\(a^{4 - k}b^k\\), then to get \\(a^2b^2\\), I need \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). So, solving \\(4 - k = 2\\), I get \\(k = 2\\). \n\nSo, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Let me compute that. \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) is \\(\\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient is 6. That seems straightforward.\n\nNow, the second part of the expression is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I'm not sure if I need to expand this part as well, but wait, the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, maybe I don't need to consider the \\(c\\) terms because \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables. Let me think about that. \n\nIf I'm only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), then perhaps the rest of the expression, which involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), doesn't affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Because when you multiply two expressions, the coefficients multiply as well. So, if I have \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. \n\nBut since I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), maybe I can treat the second part as a constant with respect to \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). Wait, but that might not be accurate because the second part is also being multiplied. Hmm, perhaps I need to consider that the entire expression is a product of two separate expansions, and the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be the coefficient from the first part times the entire second part evaluated at some point. But I'm not sure if that's correct.\n\nWait, maybe I should think of it as the product of two polynomials. So, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are different variables, the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are independent of those involving \\(c\\). Therefore, when looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), it's just the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but since we're only interested in the coefficient, perhaps it's just the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Wait, no, that doesn't seem right.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and the other terms involve \\(c\\), perhaps the coefficient is just 6, and the rest of the expression is multiplied as a whole. But that seems too simple. Let me check.\n\nWait, no, that can't be right because when you multiply two expressions together, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't make sense because then it would be 6 times (sum of coefficients), which is 6 times \\(2^6 = 64\\), so 6*64=384, which seems too large. But maybe that's correct?\n\nWait, no, because the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c=1\\), so \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\), so the sum of coefficients is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6*64=384. But that seems high. Let me think again.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6, and the rest is just multiplied as a constant factor. But that seems more plausible.\n\nWait, but when you multiply two expressions, the coefficient of a specific term in one part is multiplied by the entire other expression. So, perhaps the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would mean that the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), not a constant. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so maybe it's just 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which is 64, so 6*64=384.\n\nWait, but let me think again. When you have two polynomials multiplied together, the coefficient of a term in the product is the product of the coefficients of terms whose variables multiply to give that term. But in this case, since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient would be the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all coefficients in the second part, because the second part's terms are all multiplied by the first part's term. So, yes, I think that's correct. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 64, so 6*64=384.\n\nBut wait, another way to think about it: when you have \\((a + b)^4\\) times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient, perhaps the answer is just 6, but that seems too simple. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning that the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, which would require that the term from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is the constant term, i.e., the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. So, in that case, I would need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) and then multiply it by 6.\n\nAh, that makes more sense. So, maybe I was overcomplicating it earlier. Let me try that approach.\n\nSo, first, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, as I found before. Now, the second part is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in this expansion because when I multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), I don't want any \\(c\\) terms. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by \\(c^0\\) would be the term I'm interested in.\n\nSo, let's find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(1/c\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\).\n\nWe want the exponent of \\(c\\) to be zero, so we set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\). So, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\).\n\nCalculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6*6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the two coefficients: 6 (from \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part) times 20 (from \\(c^0\\) in the second part), which is 6*20=120.\n\nWait, that seems more reasonable. So, I think I made a mistake earlier by considering the sum of all coefficients, but actually, I should be looking for the constant term in the second part because we want the term that doesn't involve \\(c\\) when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the correct approach is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part, which is 20, and then multiply them together to get 120.\n\nLet me double-check that. So, \\((a + b)^4\\) gives \\(a^2b^2\\) with coefficient 6. \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) gives \\(c^0\\) with coefficient 20. So, when you multiply these two, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by 20, so the coefficient is 6*20=120.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So, the final answer should be 120.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we first determine the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\), giving a coefficient of \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n\nNext, we find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem, we set the exponent of \\(c\\) to zero, leading to \\(k = 3\\), and the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n\nMultiplying these coefficients together gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\boxed{120}."

So, I think I need to find the term where \\(k = 2\\) in the binomial expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\). \n\nLet me write that out. The general term is \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\\). If \\(k = 2\\), then the term is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} a^{2}b^{2}\\). Calculating the binomial coefficient, \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) is \\(\\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\).

So, does that mean that the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part will be multiplied by all the terms in the second part? Or is the question only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the other variables? \n\nLet me re-read the problem. It says, \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, it's only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and the rest of the variables (c and 1/c) can be anything because the term \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve c. So, maybe I just need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and then consider how it's affected by the other part. \n\nBut actually, when you multiply two expressions together, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression. However, since the question is only about \\(a^2b^2\\), and that term doesn't involve c, I think that when we multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by any term from the second part, it will just be \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by some constant.

But wait, that doesn't make sense because when you multiply, the coefficient would be multiplied by each term's coefficient. \n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6\\(a^2b^2\\). Now, when I multiply this by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) will be multiplied by 6\\(a^2b^2\\).

Because \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve c, so when we multiply, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by every term in the second expansion, but since the question is only about the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of c's exponents, it's just 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nWait, that can't be right because the coefficient should be a constant, not an expression. I think I'm misunderstanding the problem. Maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), that is, the term where the exponents of a, b, and c are 2, 2, and 0 respectively. Because otherwise, if it's just \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of c, then the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial in c. But that seems unlikely because the problem is probably expecting a numerical coefficient. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, considering all terms, regardless of c. But that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 6 times (1 + 1)^6 = 6*64 = 384. But I'm not sure if that's the case. \n\nWait, let me check the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, it's specifically asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the c terms. So, in the product, each term will be of the form \\(a^kb^{4 - k}c^m\\) where k is from 0 to 4, and m is some exponent from the second expansion. But the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be when k=2, so the term is 6\\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by each term from the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^m\\) for any m would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^m\\) in the second expansion. But since the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of c, I think it's considering all the terms where the exponent of a is 2 and b is 2, regardless of c's exponent. So, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nBut wait, the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by setting c=1, so it would be (1 + 1)^6 = 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6*64 = 384. \n\nBut I'm not entirely sure if that's what the problem is asking. Alternatively, maybe the problem is expecting just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and not considering the second part. But that seems unlikely because the entire expression is the product of both parts. \n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think differently. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When you multiply these two expressions, each term from the first expansion is multiplied by each term from the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first expansion, and it's multiplied by each term from the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire second expansion. But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of c's exponents, the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in c, which doesn't make sense because coefficients are constants. \n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. Maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), that is, the term where a^2b^2 is multiplied by c^0, which is 1. So, in that case, we need to find the term where in \\((a + b)^4\\), we have \\(a^2b^2\\), and in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we have the term \\(c^0\\). \n\nThat makes more sense. So, the coefficient would be the product of the coefficients from each part. So, first, find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Then, multiply those two coefficients together to get the final coefficient for \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). \n\nOkay, so let's work on that. First, we have the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. Now, we need the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem again. The expansion is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). \n\nWe need the exponent of c to be 0, so set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for m: \\(6 = 2m\\) => \\(m = 3\\). So, the term where m=3 is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} c^{0}\\). \n\nCalculating \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\): \\(\\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6*6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. \n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire expression is 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nWait, but the problem didn't specify \\(c^0\\); it just asked for \\(a^2b^2\\). So, maybe I was right earlier that the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of c's exponent. In that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that doesn't make sense because the coefficient should be a number, not a polynomial. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is only considering the terms where the exponents of a and b are 2, and the exponents of c can be anything, but then the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6*(1 + 1)^6 = 6*64 = 384. \n\nBut I think the more likely interpretation is that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. Because otherwise, if it's just \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of c, the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion, which is a polynomial, not a single coefficient. \n\nSo, I think the correct approach is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part, which is 20, and multiply them together to get 120. \n\nLet me double-check that. So, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) has a coefficient of 6. In \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term \\(c^0\\) has a coefficient of 20. When you multiply these two parts, the term \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) will have a coefficient of 6*20 = 120. \n\nYes, that makes sense. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) (assuming it's \\(a^2b^2c^0\\)) is 120. \n\nAlternatively, if the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of c, then it's 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6*(1 + 1)^6 = 6*64 = 384. But I think that's less likely because usually, when they ask for the coefficient of a specific term, they mean the term with all variables specified, or they specify that they want the coefficient regardless of other variables. \n\nIn this case, since the problem didn't specify anything about c, it's a bit ambiguous. But given the structure of the problem, I think the intended answer is 120, considering the c^0 term. \n\nSo, to summarize:\n\n1. Find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6.\n2. Find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20.\n3. Multiply them together: 6*20 = 120.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) (assuming \\(c^0\\)) is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is found by determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), then multiplying them together.\n\n1. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is calculated using the binomial coefficient:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\n   \\]\n\n2. The coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by identifying the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0. This occurs when \\(m = 3\\) in the binomial expansion:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\n   \\]\n\n3. Multiply the two coefficients together:\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 20 = 120\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

    "text": " \n\nIn this case, the first part is \\((a + b)^4\\). Let me write out the expansion using the binomial theorem. So, \\((a + b)^4 = \\dbinom{4}{0}a^4b^0 + \\dbinom{4}{1}a^3b^1 + \\dbinom{4}{2}a^2b^2 + \\dbinom{4}{3}a^1b^3 + \\dbinom{4}{4}a^0b^4\\). Simplifying the coefficients, that's \\(1 \\cdot a^4 + 4 \\cdot a^3b + 6 \\cdot a^2b^2 + 4 \\cdot ab^3 + 1 \\cdot b^4\\). \n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. But wait, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I need to consider how this multiplication affects the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). \n\nI think the key here is that the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\), and when we multiply by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nBut wait, do I need to consider any cross terms? Or is it just that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)? Hmm, actually, no. Because when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial, and the coefficients add up if the variables are the same. \n\nBut in this case, the first part is in terms of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the second part is in terms of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, the variables are different. Therefore, when we multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, but since the variables are different, the coefficients for specific terms like \\(a^2b^2\\) will just be multiplied by the entire second expansion. \n\nWait, but the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Since the second part doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), when we multiply, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) will be the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the entire second expansion. But that doesn't make sense because the second expansion has multiple terms. \n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). We need the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are only in the first part, and \\(c\\) is only in the second part, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by every term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nBut the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, does that mean we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the powers of \\(c\\)? Or do we need to consider a specific term in \\(c\\) as well? Wait, the problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", so I think it's just the coefficient in front of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of what happens with \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the same as in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nWait, that can't be right because the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) has multiple terms, each with different powers of \\(c\\). But since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables, when we multiply, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the question is just asking for a coefficient, not a polynomial. \n\nWait, maybe I misread the problem. Let me check again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, they're asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but in the entire product, which also includes terms with \\(c\\). So, perhaps they just want the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems odd because it's not a single number. \n\nAlternatively, maybe they want the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times a specific term in \\(c\\). But the problem doesn't specify, so perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Wait, maybe the question is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), treating \\(c\\) as another variable, so the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\). But that doesn't make much sense because coefficients are usually constants. \n\nWait, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some \\(k\\), but it's not specified. Hmm, no, the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so maybe it's just 6 times the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems complicated, and I don't think that's what they're asking for. \n\nWait, maybe I should consider that the entire expression is a product, so when you multiply out \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by every term in the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems too broad. \n\nWait, maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) would contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when multiplied by 6. \n\nSo, let me check: the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\). So, substituting \\(c = 1\\), we get \\((1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of coefficients is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nWait, that seems plausible. Let me think again. When you have two polynomials multiplied together, the coefficient of a specific term in one polynomial is multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the other polynomial. So, if I want the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, it would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial times the sum of coefficients in the second polynomial. \n\nYes, that makes sense because when you multiply each term in the first polynomial by each term in the second, the specific term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by every term in the second polynomial. So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by the sum of coefficients in the second part, which is 64. So, 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nWait, but let me make sure. Let me think about a simpler case. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^1 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, expanding, it's \\((a + b)(c + 1/c)\\). The coefficient of \\(a\\) would be 1 times the sum of coefficients in the second polynomial, which is \\(1 + 1 = 2\\), so 1*2=2. Similarly, the coefficient of \\(b\\) would be 1*2=2. So, that seems to hold. \n\nSimilarly, if I have \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^2\\), then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^0\\) would be 1 times the sum of coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 1 + 2 + 1 = 4. So, 1*4=4. Similarly, the coefficient of \\(a^1b^1\\) would be 2 times 4=8, and the coefficient of \\(a^0b^2\\) would be 1 times 4=4. \n\nSo, yes, that seems to work. Therefore, applying that logic, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\times (c + 1/c)^6\\) is 6 times the sum of coefficients in \\((c + 1/c)^6\\), which is 64, so 6*64=384. \n\nWait, but let me double-check the sum of coefficients in \\((c + 1/c)^6\\). To find the sum of coefficients, we set \\(c=1\\), so \\((1 + 1)^6=64\\). That's correct. \n\nAlternatively, another way to think about it is that each term in \\((c + 1/c)^6\\) is of the form \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - k}(1/c)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\\). The coefficient of each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, the sum of coefficients is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} = 2^6 = 64\\). \n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6*64=384. \n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me consider expanding both parts and multiplying. So, \\((a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). And \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - k}\\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\\). \n\nSo, when we multiply these two, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, resulting in \\(6 \\times \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is indeed \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). \n\nWait, but the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not considering \\(c\\). So, does that mean that the coefficient is 384, which is a polynomial in \\(c\\)? But that can't be right because 384 is a number, not a polynomial. \n\nWait, no, actually, when you multiply, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be a polynomial in \\(c\\), because it's 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so perhaps they mean the coefficient as a polynomial, which would be 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). \n\nBut that seems unlikely because the problem is asking for a coefficient, which is usually a number. So, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), that is, the term where the powers of \\(c\\) cancel out. \n\nWait, that might make sense. So, if we consider the entire product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by terms from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which have different powers of \\(c\\). But if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), that is, the term where the powers of \\(c\\) cancel out, then we need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) and multiply it by 6. \n\nSo, let's try that approach. First, find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial expansion, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - k}(1/c)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\\). \n\nWe want the exponent of \\(c\\) to be 0, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). \n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire product is 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nWait, but the problem didn't specify \\(c^0\\), it just said \\(a^2b^2\\). So, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). In that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial. But that seems unlikely because the problem is asking for a coefficient, which is a number. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting me to consider that the variables \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are all separate, so when we multiply the two polynomials, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will have a coefficient that's a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem is just asking for the coefficient, so maybe it's expecting 6 times the entire expansion, but that's a polynomial, not a single number. \n\nWait, maybe I should go back to the problem statement: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, it's just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), without specifying anything about \\(c\\). So, in the entire product, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), because each term in the second expansion is multiplied by 6. \n\nBut that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which is 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that seems odd because the problem is asking for a coefficient, which is typically a constant. \n\nWait, maybe the problem is written incorrectly, or perhaps I'm misinterpreting it. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be 120, as I calculated earlier. \n\nWait, let me think again. If I have two polynomials multiplied together, the coefficients of specific terms in one polynomial are multiplied by all terms in the other polynomial. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would indeed be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). \n\nBut perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\). In that case, as I calculated before, the coefficient would be 6 times 20, which is 120. \n\nWait, but the problem didn't specify \\(c^0\\), so I'm not sure. Let me check the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, it's just \\(a^2b^2\\), without any mention of \\(c\\). \n\nIn that case, I think the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), because each term in the second expansion is multiplied by 6. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(6 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). \n\nBut that seems complicated, and I'm not sure if that's what the problem is asking for. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting me to consider that the variables \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are all present, and the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be a polynomial in \\(c\\), but the problem is just asking for the coefficient, which is a number. \n\nWait, maybe I should consider that the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120, as I calculated earlier. That seems more likely because otherwise, the answer would be a polynomial, which doesn't make sense in this context. \n\nWait, let me think about it differently. If I were to write the entire expansion, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by each term from the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be a polynomial in \\(c\\), but if the problem is just asking for the coefficient, perhaps it's expecting the entire polynomial. But that seems unlikely because the problem is probably expecting a numerical coefficient. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), so it's just 6 times the entire expansion, but that would be a polynomial, not a number. \n\nWait, perhaps the problem is written in such a way that it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating \\(c\\) as a variable, so the coefficient is a polynomial. But that seems unusual. \n\nWait, maybe I should look for another approach. Let me consider that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, so we can think of it as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient is 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). \n\nBut that seems like it's not a number, so perhaps the problem is expecting me to consider that the variables are independent, so the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion. But that doesn't make sense because coefficients are usually constants. \n\nWait, I'm getting confused. Let me try to think differently. Maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be 120, as I calculated earlier. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting me to recognize that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the sum of coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, so 6*64=384. \n\nBut I'm not sure which interpretation is correct. Let me try to see which one makes more sense. If I consider that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), then it's 6 times the entire expansion, which is a polynomial. But if it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it's 120. \n\nWait, perhaps the problem is written in such a way that it's expecting me to consider that the coefficient is 6 times the expansion, but that seems unlikely. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting me to consider that the coefficient is 6 times the middle term, which is 20, giving 120. \n\nWait, but I think the correct approach is to consider that when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in one polynomial is multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the other polynomial. So, in this case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial is 6, and the sum of coefficients in the second polynomial is 64, so the coefficient in the product is 6*64=384. \n\nBut that seems a bit counterintuitive because the second polynomial has terms with different powers of \\(c\\). So, perhaps the problem is expecting me to consider that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the entire expansion, which is 6*(c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15/c^2 + 6/c^4 + 1/c^6). But that would make the coefficient a polynomial, which doesn't seem right. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting me to consider that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the constant term of the second expansion, which is 20, giving 120. \n\nWait, but why would it be the constant term? Because if we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\), then it's 6 times the entire expansion. But if we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it's 6*20=120. \n\nI think the problem is more likely expecting the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120, because otherwise, the answer would be a polynomial, which doesn't make sense in the context of a coefficient. \n\nWait, but to confirm, let me think about how coefficients work when multiplying polynomials. Each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial, and the coefficients add up if the variables match. But in this case, since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are different variables, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient from the first part times the entire second polynomial. \n\nWait, but that's not quite right. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the same as the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part, because each term in the second part contributes to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when multiplied by the first part. \n\nWait, no, that's not accurate. Let me think again. When you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a term like \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is equal to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial. Because each term in the second polynomial contributes to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when multiplied by the corresponding term in the first polynomial. \n\nWait, so if the first polynomial has a term \\(6a^2b^2\\) and the second polynomial has terms \\(c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15/c^2 + 6/c^4 + 1/c^6\\), then when you multiply \\(6a^2b^2\\) by each of these terms, you get \\(6c^6a^2b^2 + 36c^4a^2b^2 + 90c^2a^2b^2 + 120a^2b^2 + 90/c^2a^2b^2 + 36/c^4a^2b^2 + 6/c^6a^2b^2\\). \n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is actually the entire polynomial \\(6c^6 + 36c^4 + 90c^2 + 120 + 90/c^2 + 36/c^4 + 6/c^6\\). But that seems complicated, and I don't think the problem is expecting that. \n\nAlternatively, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is the constant term with respect to \\(c\\), then it's 120. \n\nWait, but the problem didn't specify \\(c^0\\), so I'm confused. Maybe I should check the problem again. It says: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, it's just \\(a^2b^2\\), without any mention of \\(c\\). \n\nIn that case, I think the answer is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial. But that seems odd because coefficients are usually constants. \n\nWait, perhaps the problem is written in a way that the variables \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are all separate, and the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is a polynomial in \\(c\\). So, the coefficient would be \\(6 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial. But that seems unlikely because the problem is asking for a coefficient, which is typically a number. \n\nWait, maybe I should consider that the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120, as I calculated earlier. Because that would make the answer a number, which makes sense. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting me to consider that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the expansion, but that's a polynomial, not a number. \n\nWait, I'm going to go with the interpretation that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. Because that makes the answer a number, and it's a common type of problem where you're asked for the coefficient of a specific term, considering all variables. \n\nSo, to summarize, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product is 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nI think that's the answer the problem is expecting. So, the final answer is 120. \n\nWait, but let me double-check the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem, the general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\\). Setting the exponent to 0, 6 - 2k = 0, so k = 3. Therefore, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, yes, that's correct. \n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nSo, I think that's the answer. \n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem.\n\nFirst, we expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n\\]\nThe term containing \\(a^2b^2\\) is:\n\\[\n\\dbinom{4}{2} a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\n\\]\nSo, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\nNext, we need to consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem, we have:\n\\[\n\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n\\]\nWe are interested in the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, which means:\n\\[\n6 - 2k = 0 \\implies k = 3\n\\]\nThe coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in this expansion is:\n\\[\n\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is the product of the coefficients we found:\n\\[\n6 \\times 20 = 120\n\\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}."

    "text": " \n\nWait, but the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). That means I need to find the term where the powers of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2. So, in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\), the term with \\(a^2b^2\\) should be when \\(k = 2\\), right? Because if \\(k = 2\\), then the exponent on \\(b\\) is 2, and the exponent on \\(a\\) would be \\(4 - 2 = 2\\). \n\nSo, let me calculate that coefficient. Using the binomial coefficient formula, \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). I remember that \\(\\dbinom{n}{k} = \\dfrac{n!}{k!(n - k)!}\\). Plugging in the numbers, \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. \n\nBut wait, the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, does that mean I have to consider the expansion of that part as well? Hmm, actually, since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which only involves \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), maybe the other part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), just contributes a constant factor when considering the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. \n\nLet me think about that. When I multiply two expressions together, the coefficients multiply as well. So, if I have \\((a + b)^4\\) expanded and then multiply each term by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the coefficients from each part will multiply. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient from the \\(c\\) part must be the constant term. \n\nWait, is that right? Because if I have \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part, and then I multiply it by something that might have \\(c\\) terms, but since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't have any \\(c\\) terms, the coefficient would just be the product of the coefficients from each part. So, actually, I think I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because when I multiply it by \\(a^2b^2\\), the constant term will just multiply the coefficient, and the other terms would introduce \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), which we don't want because we're only interested in \\(a^2b^2\\). \n\nSo, let me work on finding the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Again, I can use the binomial theorem here. The expansion is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k\\). Simplifying that, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} c^{-k} = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). \n\nI need the term where the exponent on \\(c\\) is zero because that's the constant term. So, I set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), \\(6 = 2k\\) so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is when \\(k = 3\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). \n\nSo, the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Therefore, when I multiply the two parts together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) will be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the constant term from the other part. \n\nEarlier, I found that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. So, multiplying those together, 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. Is the constant term the only part that affects the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)? Because when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first polynomial gets multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. So, if I have \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part and a term with \\(c^k\\) from the second part, then \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) would be a term in the product. But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term without any \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), I think that only the constant term from the second part will contribute to that. \n\nSo, yes, I think my approach is correct. Therefore, the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nWait, but just to double-check, let me think about the entire expansion. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). When I expand each part separately, the first part will have terms like \\(a^4\\), \\(a^3b\\), \\(a^2b^2\\), etc., and the second part will have terms like \\(c^6\\), \\(c^5\\), \\(c^4\\), ..., up to \\(c^{-6}\\). \n\nNow, when I multiply these together, each term from the first part is multiplied by each term from the second part. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term from the second part. But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), we're only interested in the terms where the product doesn't introduce any \\(c\\) terms. That is, only the constant term in the second part will contribute to \\(a^2b^2\\). All other terms from the second part will result in \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2/c^k\\), which aren't just \\(a^2b^2\\). \n\nTherefore, yes, only the constant term from the second part affects the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient is indeed 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of it as the entire expression being a product, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the product of the coefficients from each part, but only when the exponents on \\(c\\) cancel out. So, since we're looking for the term where \\(c^0\\) is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), the coefficient is the product of the coefficients from the respective terms. \n\nI think that's solid. So, the coefficient is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is found by considering the expansion of each part. Using the binomial theorem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Multiplying these together gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\boxed{120}"

    "text": " \n\nLet me focus on the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\). Using the binomial theorem, this would expand to \\(\\dbinom{4}{0}a^4 + \\dbinom{4}{1}a^3b + \\dbinom{4}{2}a^2b^2 + \\dbinom{4}{3}ab^3 + \\dbinom{4}{4}b^4\\). So, the term with \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}a^2b^2\\).

So, I think I need to consider both parts. Hmm, actually, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), so maybe the coefficient is just the same as in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6? But that seems too straightforward. \n\nWait, no, maybe I'm misunderstanding. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product of the two expressions. So, perhaps I need to multiply the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) by the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), and then find the coefficient where the variables are \\(a^2b^2\\) and the rest are multiplied by the other expansion. But that doesn't make much sense because \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\). \n\nWait, actually, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. The expression is a product of two separate binomials: one involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the other involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, when we multiply them out, the variables in the first part (\\(a\\) and \\(b\\)) are independent of the variables in the second part (\\(c\\)). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part would be multiplied by every term in the second expansion. But since the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, I think that the coefficient would just be the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the entire second expansion. But that doesn't seem right either because the second expansion has multiple terms. \n\nWait, maybe I'm misinterpreting the question. Perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some \\(k\\), but it's just written as \\(a^2b^2\\). Hmm, but the way it's written, it's just \\(a^2b^2\\), without any \\(c\\) terms. So, maybe the coefficient is just the coefficient from the first part, because the second part doesn't affect \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). \n\nBut that seems too simple. Let me think again. If I have \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), when I expand the entire expression, each term in the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^5\\), etc., each with their own coefficients. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not \\(a^2b^2c^k\\). So, if we're only considering the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then the coefficient would be the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the entire second expansion. \n\nBut that would mean the coefficient is 6 times the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial in \\(c\\). However, that doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, not an expression. \n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, meaning that we need to consider the product of the two expansions and find the coefficient where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2 each, regardless of the exponent of \\(c\\). But that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nBut wait, the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) would be found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, the coefficient would be 6 * 64 = 384. But that seems high, and I'm not sure if that's the correct approach. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, considering all possible terms, which would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of the coefficients of all terms in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is indeed 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nBut I'm not entirely confident. Let me check another approach. Suppose I consider the entire expression as a product of two polynomials, one in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the other in \\(c\\). So, when I multiply them, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial would be multiplied by every term in the second polynomial, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^5\\), etc. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial times the entire second polynomial. But that would mean that the coefficient is not a single number, but rather a polynomial in \\(c\\). \n\nWait, but the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which suggests that it's looking for a numerical coefficient, not a polynomial. So, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Maybe the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then considering that this term is multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, the coefficient remains 6. \n\nBut that doesn't seem right because the problem includes the second part. Maybe I need to consider that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 multiplied by the sum of the coefficients of all terms in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). As I thought earlier, the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning that the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out. So, in that case, I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\) in the entire product. That would require me to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), then multiply them together. \n\nLet me try that. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, as before. Now, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) can be found using the binomial theorem. The expansion is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, we need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, which means \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). \n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire product is 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nWait, but the problem didn't specify anything about \\(c\\), just \\(a^2b^2\\). So, if it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then it's 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which would be a polynomial in \\(c\\). But if it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it's 120. \n\nI think the problem is more likely asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), because otherwise, it would have specified that it's looking for the coefficient regardless of \\(c\\). So, I think the answer is 120. \n\nLet me verify this approach. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\) with coefficient 6. The term \\(c^0\\) comes from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) with coefficient 20.

    "text": " \n\nAlright, so for the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), I can expand this using the binomial theorem. Let me write that out. The expansion would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{0}a^4 + \\dbinom{4}{1}a^3b + \\dbinom{4}{2}a^2b^2 + \\dbinom{4}{3}ab^3 + \\dbinom{4}{4}b^4\\). Calculating the coefficients, that's \\(1 \\cdot a^4 + 4 \\cdot a^3b + 6 \\cdot a^2b^2 + 4 \\cdot ab^3 + 1 \\cdot b^4\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) here is 6. \n\nBut wait, the problem isn't just \\((a + b)^4\\), it's multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I need to consider that when finding the overall coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Hmm, how does that work? Let me think. \n\nI think the key here is that the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\), and the rest of the expression \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) doesn't affect the powers of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). So, maybe the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just the same as the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nWait, no, that doesn't seem right. Because when you multiply two expressions together, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression. So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I need to find all the ways that \\(a^2b^2\\) can be formed when multiplying the two expansions. But since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) don't appear in the second part \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), maybe the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of the second part, but that doesn't make sense because the second part doesn't have \\(a\\) or \\(b\\). \n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from \\((a + b)^4\\), and when you multiply by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nIs that correct? Wait, no, that's not quite right. Because when you multiply, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, but the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is only affected by the terms in the second expansion that don't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), but since the second expansion only involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), all the terms in the second expansion will multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. \n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nBut wait, is that accurate? Let me think again. When you have two independent variables, like \\(a, b\\) and \\(c\\), the terms in the product are combinations of terms from each expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product can only come from the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by any term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is indeed the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nWait, but actually, no, that's not quite correct. Because when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each polynomial. But in this case, since the second polynomial doesn't have \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) can only come from multiplying the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first polynomial by the entire second polynomial. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial. \n\nWait, but let me check that. Suppose I have two polynomials: \\(P(a, b) = \\text{something}\\) and \\(Q(c) = \\text{something}\\). Then, the product \\(P(a, b) \\cdot Q(c)\\) would have terms that are products of terms from \\(P\\) and \\(Q\\). So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), it would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(P(a, b)\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(Q(c)\\), because each term in \\(Q(c)\\) will multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term, and since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient would be the product of the coefficients. \n\nBut wait, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(P(a, b)\\) multiplied by the entire \\(Q(c)\\), but since \\(Q(c)\\) is a polynomial in \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(P(a, b)\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(Q(c)\\), because each term in \\(Q(c)\\) contributes a coefficient that gets multiplied by the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. \n\nWait, no, that's not quite accurate. Let me think differently. Let me denote \\(P(a, b) = (a + b)^4\\) and \\(Q(c) = \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Then, the product \\(P(a, b) \\cdot Q(c)\\) is a polynomial in \\(a, b, c\\). The term \\(a^2b^2\\) in this product can only come from multiplying the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in \\(P(a, b)\\) by each term in \\(Q(c)\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(P(a, b)\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(Q(c)\\). \n\nWait, but no, that's not correct. Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in \\(Q(c)\\), you get terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for various \\(k\\), but the term \\(a^2b^2\\) itself is only present when multiplied by the constant term in \\(Q(c)\\), i.e., the term where \\(c^0\\). So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(P(a, b)\\) multiplied by the constant term in \\(Q(c)\\). \n\nWait, that makes more sense. Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in \\(Q(c)\\), the only way to get a term that's just \\(a^2b^2\\) (without any \\(c\\) terms) is to multiply by the constant term in \\(Q(c)\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(P(a, b)\\) multiplied by the constant term in \\(Q(c)\\). \n\nOkay, that seems more accurate. So, I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which we already found to be 6, and then multiply it by the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nNow, let me find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). To do this, I can use the binomial theorem again. The expansion is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). \n\nI need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, because that's the constant term. So, set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(6 = 2k\\) so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). \n\nCalculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\cdot 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20. \n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). \n\nWait, let me double-check that. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20, so multiplying them gives 120. That seems correct. \n\nAlternatively, I can think of it as the product of the two coefficients because the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is independent of \\(c\\), so when you multiply by the constant term, which is 20, you get 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nYes, that makes sense. So, I think the coefficient is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is found using the binomial theorem: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). The constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying these gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\(\\boxed{120}\\)"

So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\nNow, the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I'm supposed to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which means I don't need to worry about the \\(c\\) terms because they're separate. So, does that mean the coefficient from the first part is just multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part? Wait, no, that doesn't make sense. Because the second part is also an expansion, and if I'm only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), then the \\(c\\) terms can be anything\u2014they don't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. \n\nWait, actually, I think I might be overcomplicating this. Since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and the expression is a product of two separate binomial expansions, I can treat them independently. That is, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't seem right because the \\(c\\) terms would still be part of the product, so maybe I'm misunderstanding the question.\n\nWait, let me read the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, actually, the expression is a product of two separate polynomials, one in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the other in \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). Since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are different variables, the terms in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are independent of those in \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be the coefficient from the \\((a + b)^4\\) part, because the \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) part doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. \n\nWait, but that seems too straightforward. Let me think again. If I have \\((a + b)^4\\) times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), then each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by every term from the second part. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would mean that the coefficient is the coefficient from the first part times the entire expansion of the second part, because \\(a^2b^2\\) is being multiplied by all the possible terms involving \\(c\\). But that can't be right because then the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the question is just asking for a numerical coefficient.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misinterpreting the problem. Maybe the question is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. In other words, when you multiply out the entire expression, you'll have terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for various \\(k\\), but the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the sum of all the coefficients from the second part, because each term in the second part is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient from the first part times the sum of the coefficients from the second part. But the sum of the coefficients in the second part is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), so \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient would be \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\nWait, but that doesn't seem right either because the second part is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), and when you set \\(c = 1\\), it's indeed 64, but the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a specific term, not the sum of all coefficients. Alternatively, maybe the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of the second part, but that would result in a polynomial, not a single coefficient. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and the expression is a product of two independent expansions, the coefficient would just be the coefficient from the first part, because the second part doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. So, the coefficient is 6, and the \\(c\\) terms are separate. But that seems too simple, and I feel like I'm missing something.\n\nWait, let me try another approach. Let's expand both parts separately and then see what happens when we multiply them. The first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), as I found earlier, has a term \\(6a^2b^2\\). The second part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), can be expanded using the binomial theorem as well. The general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - k}\\left(1/c\\right)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, each term in the second expansion is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\\).\n\nNow, when we multiply the two expansions together, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second part, resulting in terms like \\(6a^2b^2 \\times \\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be \\(6\\) times the sum of all the coefficients from the second part because each term in the second part contributes a coefficient when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). \n\nWait, but the sum of all coefficients in the second part is obtained by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\(\\left(1 + 1/1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). But that seems like a lot. Alternatively, maybe I'm supposed to consider that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just 6, and the \\(c\\) terms are separate, so the coefficient is 6 regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. But that doesn't make sense because the entire expression is a product, so each term in the product would have both \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms and \\(c\\) terms. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually be the sum of all the coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by 6. \n\nWait, but let me think again. If I have \\(6a^2b^2\\) multiplied by each term in the second expansion, then each of those terms would have a coefficient, and when you collect like terms, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients from the second expansion. Since the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion is 64, then yes, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nBut I'm a bit unsure because sometimes when you're asked for the coefficient of a specific term, you have to consider that the term might only appear once, but in this case, since the second expansion has multiple terms, each multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), the coefficient would indeed be the sum of all those coefficients multiplied by 6.\n\nWait, but actually, no. Because when you multiply \\(6a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, each resulting term is \\(6 \\times \\dbinom{6}{k} a^2b^2 c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the sum of all the coefficients from the second expansion, each multiplied by 6. So, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}\\) for \\(k = 0\\) to \\(6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nBut wait, another way to think about it: when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each polynomial. But in this case, the first polynomial has a term \\(6a^2b^2\\) and the second polynomial has terms with various powers of \\(c\\). Since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be \\(6\\) times the sum of all the coefficients in the second polynomial, because each term in the second polynomial is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). \n\nAlternatively, if I think of it as a product of two independent polynomials, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient from the first polynomial times the sum of all coefficients from the second polynomial, which is indeed 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me verify this with a smaller example to make sure I'm not making a mistake. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^1 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, expanding, I get \\((a + b)(c + 1/c)\\). The coefficient of \\(a^1b^0\\) would be the coefficient of \\(a\\) in the first part times the sum of coefficients in the second part. The coefficient of \\(a\\) is 1, and the sum of coefficients in the second part is \\(1 + 1 = 2\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a\\) in the product would be 1 * 2 = 2. But when I actually expand it, I get \\(ac + a/c + bc + b/c\\). The coefficient of \\(a\\) is indeed 2, because \\(a\\) is multiplied by \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), so the coefficients are 1 and 1, adding up to 2. Similarly, the coefficient of \\(b\\) would be 2 as well. So, in this case, the approach works.\n\nTherefore, applying the same logic, in the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not confusing the terms. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\). So, in the product, each term will be of the form \\(a^kb^{4 - k}c^{6 - 2m}\\) where \\(k\\) ranges from 0 to 4 and \\(m\\) ranges from 0 to 6. But the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is when \\(k = 2\\), so it's \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by each term from the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the coefficient from the first part (which is 6) times the sum of all coefficients from the second part (which is 64), giving 384.\n\nAlternatively, if I think about it as the product of two polynomials, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial and the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial. Since the second polynomial is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), its sum of coefficients is indeed \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\), so the total coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but another way to think about it is that when you have two polynomials multiplied together, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum of the products of coefficients of terms whose variables multiply to give that specific term. But in this case, since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial, because each term in the second polynomial can be paired with \\(a^2b^2\\) to form a term in the product. Therefore, yes, 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nI think that makes sense. So, the coefficient is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is found using the binomial theorem: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). The entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), whose sum of coefficients is \\(2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\boxed{384}."

But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), does that mean that the coefficient will be the same as in A? Or is there something I'm missing?\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would just be the coefficient from part A, because when you multiply by part B, each term in part A gets multiplied by each term in part B, but \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't have any \\(c\\) terms, so the coefficient would be the sum of the products where part B contributes 1 to the coefficient. But wait, that might not be correct.\n\nLet me clarify. Let's say in part A, the term is \\(6a^2b^2\\), and in part B, the expansion is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying that, it's \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). \n\nSo, when I multiply part A and part B, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from part A will be multiplied by each term in part B. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be \\(6\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients from part B. Because each term in part B is a coefficient times a power of \\(c\\), but since we're only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is independent of \\(c\\), the coefficient would be \\(6\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in part B. \n\nWait, but the sum of all coefficients in part B is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which would give \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). \n\nHmm, that seems plausible, but let me check if that's correct. Alternatively, maybe I'm supposed to consider that the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is only affected by the constant term in part B, which would be when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. Let me see.\n\nIn part B, the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero is when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), so \\(m = 3\\). The coefficient for that term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\), which is 20. So, the constant term in part B is 20. Therefore, when I multiply the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) from part A by the constant term 20 from part B, I get \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 120.\n\nWait, now I'm confused because earlier I thought it would be 384, but now I'm getting 120. Which one is correct?\n\nLet me think again. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when I expand the product, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nThe term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\) with coefficient 6, as I calculated before. Now, when I multiply this term by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), I get terms like \\(6a^2b^2 \\times \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). \n\nBut the question is specifically asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). Wait, no, actually, no, because the problem statement is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\). So, in the entire expansion, \\(a^2b^2\\) can be multiplied by any power of \\(c\\), but since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I think it's considering all terms where the exponent of \\(a\\) is 2 and the exponent of \\(b\\) is 2, regardless of the exponent of \\(c\\). \n\nWait, but that can't be, because \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term without \\(c\\), so when you multiply by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by terms involving \\(c\\), so the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), leading to terms like \\(6a^2b^2 \\times \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). \n\nWait, but if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then that would mean that all the terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any power of \\(c\\) would contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). But that doesn't make sense because \\(a^2b^2\\) is a specific term, and when you multiply it by \\(c^k\\), it becomes \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), which is a different term. \n\nWait, perhaps I misread the problem. Let me check again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, the expression is a product of two polynomials, one in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the other in \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, when you multiply them, the variables \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are all separate. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\), because otherwise, it would have a \\(c\\) term. \n\nWait, that makes sense. So, to get the term \\(a^2b^2\\), we need to have \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part, and \\(c^0\\) from the second part. Because if you have any power of \\(c\\), the term would be \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), which is a different term. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). \n\nSo, first, as I calculated before, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. Then, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is the middle term when \\(m = 3\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought maybe it's 384, but that was when I considered multiplying by all terms in part B, but that would be if I was looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times some power of \\(c\\), but since the problem is just asking for \\(a^2b^2\\), without any \\(c\\) terms, then it's only the product of the coefficients where the \\(c\\) terms cancel out, i.e., \\(c^0\\). \n\nLet me confirm that. So, in the product, each term is a combination of a term from \\((a + b)^4\\) and a term from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, to get a term that is just \\(a^2b^2\\), without any \\(c\\) factors, we need to take \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part and \\(c^0\\) from the second part. Therefore, the coefficient is the product of the coefficients from each part, which is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Suppose I expand both parts separately. The first part gives me terms like \\(a^4\\), \\(4a^3b\\), \\(6a^2b^2\\), \\(4ab^3\\), and \\(b^4\\). The second part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), expands to terms involving various powers of \\(c\\), including \\(c^6\\), \\(6c^4\\), \\(15c^2\\), \\(20\\), \\(15/c^2\\), \\(6/c^4\\), and \\(1/c^6\\). \n\nWhen I multiply these two expansions together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second part, resulting in terms like \\(6a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(6a^2b^2 \\times 6c^4\\), and so on, down to \\(6a^2b^2 \\times 20\\) (which is \\(120a^2b^2\\)), and then terms with negative exponents. \n\nBut the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't have any \\(c\\) in it. So, the only term that contributes to \\(a^2b^2\\) is when we multiply \\(6a^2b^2\\) by the constant term 20, giving \\(120a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient is 120.\n\nWait, but I'm still a bit confused because earlier I thought maybe the entire sum of coefficients from part B would multiply the term, but that would be if the problem was asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times some function of \\(c\\), but since it's just \\(a^2b^2\\), it's only the constant term that matters. \n\nLet me also think about the structure of the expression. The entire expression is a product of two polynomials, so when you multiply them, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second part, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\). The only way to get a term that's just \\(a^2b^2\\) is when \\(k = 0\\), which is the constant term in the second polynomial. Therefore, the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but just to be thorough, let me consider an example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^1 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Let's compute this. \n\n\\((a + b)(c + 1/c) = a c + a/c + b c + b/c\\). The coefficient of \\(a^1b^0\\) is \\(c + 1/c\\), but if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^1b^0\\) without any \\(c\\) terms, that would be zero because there are no such terms. \n\nWait, but in this case, the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term without any \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\). So, in the expansion, the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) is to multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part by the constant term from the second part. \n\nSo, in the original problem, the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nWait, but earlier I thought maybe the entire sum of coefficients from part B would affect it, but that's not the case because the problem is specifically looking for a term without \\(c\\). \n\nLet me check another way. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). \n\nSo, as I calculated, that's 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nAlternatively, if I were to consider the entire expansion, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would appear multiplied by various powers of \\(c\\), but the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would require that the power of \\(c\\) is zero. \n\nTherefore, the coefficient is 120.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not missing something. Let me think about how the product works. \n\nWhen you have \\((a + b)^4\\), the expansion is \\(a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). \n\nWhen you have \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the expansion is \\(c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15/c^2 + 6/c^4 + 1/c^6\\).\n\nSo, when you multiply these two, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, resulting in:\n\n\\(6a^2b^2c^6 + 6a^2b^2 \\times 6c^4 + 6a^2b^2 \\times 15c^2 + 6a^2b^2 \\times 20 + 6a^2b^2 \\times 15/c^2 + 6a^2b^2 \\times 6/c^4 + 6a^2b^2 \\times 1/c^6\\).\n\nSo, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) appears with coefficients multiplied by each power of \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is the term without any \\(c\\). So, in this case, the only term that contributes to \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) is when it's multiplied by 20, the constant term. So, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nTherefore, the answer should be 120.\n\nWait, but let me check if I made a mistake in calculating the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). The general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\times (1/c)^m = \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, to get the exponent of \\(c\\) equal to zero, we solve \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which gives \\(m = 3\\). So, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\), which is correct.\n\nSo, yes, the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me think about another approach. Maybe using generating functions or considering the multinomial theorem, but I think that's complicating things. Alternatively, perhaps I can consider that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the product of the coefficients of \\(a^2b^2\\) in each part, but that's only true if the parts are independent, which they are in this case because they involve different variables. \n\nWait, but in this case, the variables are separate, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the product of the coefficients from each part. But no, that's not quite right, because the second part doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), so it's more accurate to say that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the sum of coefficients from the second part that don't affect \\(a\\) or \\(b\\). But since the second part is independent, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the constant term from the second part.\n\nWait, but in reality, the entire second part is a polynomial in \\(c\\), so when you multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), you get \\(a^2b^2\\) times each term in the second polynomial. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't include \\(c\\), the only term that contributes is the constant term in the second polynomial. Therefore, the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nYes, I think that's correct. So, the final answer is 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break down the problem into two parts using the binomial theorem.\n\n1. **Expanding \\((a + b)^4\\):**\n   Using the binomial theorem, the general term in the expansion is given by:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   We need the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2, which occurs when \\(k = 2\\):\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\n   \\]\n   Thus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\n2. **Expanding \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   Using the binomial theorem, the general term in the expansion is given by:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n   \\]\n   We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, which occurs when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\) or \\(m = 3\\):\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{6}{3} c^0 = 20\n   \\]\n   Thus, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20.\n\n3. **Combining the results:**\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficients from each part:\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 20 = 120\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

    "text": " \n\nLet me start by expanding \\((a + b)^4\\). Using the binomial theorem, this would be \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\\). I'm looking for the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2, which means \\(a^2b^2\\). So, I need to find the value of \\(k\\) such that \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). That makes sense because if \\(k = 2\\), then \\(4 - 2 = 2\\). So, the term would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} a^2b^2\\).\n\nCalculating the binomial coefficient \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\), I remember that \\(\\dbinom{n}{k} = \\dfrac{n!}{k!(n - k)!}\\). Plugging in the numbers, that's \\(\\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), is 6. \n\nNow, the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Since I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I realize that the part involving \\(c\\) doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. That is, when I multiply the two expressions together, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will be multiplied by every term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). However, since I'm just looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and not any term involving \\(c\\), I think I can treat the two parts separately and then multiply their coefficients. \n\nWait, no, actually, I might be overcomplicating it. Let me think again. The entire expression is a product of two expansions, so when I expand both, each term from the first expansion will multiply each term from the second expansion. But since I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I can focus on the terms that don't involve \\(c\\) because any term involving \\(c\\) would change the variables, and I don't want that. So, actually, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first part is multiplied by the constant term (if there is one) in the second expansion, which is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nWait, does \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) have a constant term? Let me check. To find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), I can use the binomial theorem again. The general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). For this to be a constant term, the exponent of \\(c\\) must be zero. So, \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which implies \\(k = 3\\). \n\nSo, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} c^{0} = \\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, the constant term is 20. \n\nPutting it all together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion is multiplied by the constant term 20 from the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not missing anything here. Is there a possibility that other terms from the second expansion could contribute to the \\(a^2b^2\\) term when multiplied by terms from the first expansion? For example, if I had a term with \\(c\\) in the first expansion and a term with \\(1/c\\) in the second expansion, but no, because the first expansion only has \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), no \\(c\\) terms. So, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first part is only multiplied by the constant term in the second part, and not by any other terms involving \\(c\\). \n\nTherefore, I think my reasoning is correct. The coefficient is 6 from the first part multiplied by 20 from the second part, giving 120. \n\nJust to recap, the steps I took were:\n1. Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is 6.\n2. Recognize that the entire expression is a product of two parts, so the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\).\n3. Determine that only the constant term in the second expansion will affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) because any other term would introduce \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), which we don't want.\n4. Calculate the constant term in the second expansion using the binomial theorem, finding it to be 20.\n5. Multiply the two coefficients together to get the final coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is 120.\n\nI don't see any mistakes in my reasoning, so I'm confident that the coefficient is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is found using the binomial theorem: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).

I want the term where \\(a^2b^2\\), which means \\(4 - k = 2\\) for the exponent of \\(a\\), so \\(k = 2\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). \n\nCalculating that, \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\).

Wait, but the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Hmm, does the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)? Let me think.\n\nI think when you multiply two expressions, the coefficients multiply as well if the variables are independent. In this case, \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) are multiplied together, and since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are different variables, the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) don't interact with the terms involving \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would just be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the coefficient from the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because if there's a \\(c\\) term, it would multiply with \\(a^2b^2\\) and make it something like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), but the problem is only asking for \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, I think I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because that's the term that doesn't have any \\(c\\) in it, so when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), it remains \\(a^2b^2\\).\n\nSo, let me find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Again, using the binomial theorem, the expansion is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying that, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m} = \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). \n\nI need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, because that's the constant term. So, set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), \\(6 = 2m\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\).\n\nCalculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20.\n\nNow, since the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6, and the constant term in the second part is 20, the overall coefficient in the product is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nWait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake. So, the first part is \\((a + b)^4\\), which gives \\(a^2b^2\\) with coefficient 6. The second part is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which has a constant term 20. Multiplying these together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by 20, so the coefficient is indeed 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of it as the entire product being the product of two expansions, so each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by every term in the second expansion. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), we only care about the terms in the second expansion that are constants, because any term with \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\) would create a term like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), which isn't just \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, only the constant term in the second expansion contributes to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, that makes sense.\n\nLet me double-check the calculations. For the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Correct.\n\nFor the second part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the constant term is when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which gives \\(m = 3\\). Then, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Correct.\n\nSo, multiplying 6 and 20, I get 120. So, the coefficient is 120.\n\nWait, is there another way to approach this? Maybe using multinomial coefficients or something else? Let me think.\n\nAlternatively, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). If I were to expand this, each term would be a product of a term from the first expansion and a term from the second expansion. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the first part, and to get the coefficient, we need to multiply it by the constant term from the second part. So, that's consistent with what I did before.\n\nAlternatively, if I consider that the entire expression is a product, and the variables \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are independent, then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and the coefficient of \\(1\\) (i.e., the constant term) in the second part. So, that again leads me to 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nI think that makes sense. So, I think the coefficient is 120.\n\nWait, just to be thorough, maybe I can compute the entire expansion or at least check if 120 is a reasonable number.\n\nLet me compute \\((a + b)^4\\): that's \\(a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6.\n\nNow, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Let me compute that. The expansion would be:\n\n\\(\\dbinom{6}{0}c^6(1/c)^0 = 1 \\times c^6 \\times 1 = c^6\\)\n\n\\(\\dbinom{6}{1}c^5(1/c)^1 = 6 \\times c^5 \\times 1/c = 6c^4\\)\n\n\\(\\dbinom{6}{2}c^4(1/c)^2 = 15 \\times c^4 \\times 1/c^2 = 15c^2\\)\n\n\\(\\dbinom{6}{3}c^3(1/c)^3 = 20 \\times c^3 \\times 1/c^3 = 20\\)\n\n\\(\\dbinom{6}{4}c^2(1/c)^4 = 15 \\times c^2 \\times 1/c^4 = 15/c^2\\)\n\n\\(\\dbinom{6}{5}c^1(1/c)^5 = 6 \\times c \\times 1/c^5 = 6/c^4\\)\n\n\\(\\dbinom{6}{6}c^0(1/c)^6 = 1 \\times 1 \\times 1/c^6 = 1/c^6\\)\n\nSo, the expansion is \\(c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15/c^2 + 6/c^4 + 1/c^6\\). So, the constant term is indeed 20.\n\nTherefore, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. However, only the constant term (20) will result in a term that is just \\(a^2b^2\\). The other terms will have powers of \\(c\\), so they won't contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nI think that's solid. So, the answer should be 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break the problem into two parts using the binomial theorem.\n\nFirst, consider the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\). Using the binomial theorem, the general term is \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\\). We need the term where \\(a^2b^2\\), which corresponds to \\(k = 2\\). The coefficient is:\n\\[\n\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\n\\]\n\nNext, consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem, the general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We need the constant term, which occurs when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), giving \\(m = 3\\). The coefficient is:\n\\[\n\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\n\\]\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficients from each part:\n\\[\n6 \\times 20 = 120\n\\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

    "text": " \n\nLet me focus on the first part of the expression, which is \\((a + b)^4\\). I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in this expansion. Using the binomial theorem, the general term in the expansion is \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}a^{4 - k}b^k\\). I want the term where the exponents of both \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2. That means \\(4 - k = 2\\) for \\(a\\), so \\(k = 2\\). So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Let me calculate that: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient from the first part is 6.\n\nNow, the expression also has another part, which is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I need to think about how this affects the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, but \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), so maybe the terms involving \\(c\\) don't directly affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Or do they? Hmm, let me think. The entire expression is the product of two expansions: one involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the other involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, when I multiply them together, each term from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term from the second expansion. \n\nBut the problem specifically asks for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). That means I only care about the terms where the variables are \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of what happens with \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire second part, because the second part doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\) at all. Wait, is that correct? Let me make sure.\n\nSo, if I have \\((a + b)^4\\) times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), when I expand it, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, for example, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion will be multiplied by every term in the second expansion. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which means we are only interested in the terms where the power of \\(a\\) is 2 and the power of \\(b\\) is 2, regardless of what's happening with \\(c\\). \n\nWait, but that might not be the case. Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by terms involving \\(c\\), the resulting terms will have \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by various powers of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) itself is actually the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part, because the second part doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), so it doesn't change the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. \n\nWait, no, that doesn't make sense. Let me think again. If I have \\( (a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 \\), then each term in the expansion will be of the form \\( \\text{(term from first expansion)} \\times \\text{(term from second expansion)} \\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) where \\(k\\) is some exponent. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would actually be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, the coefficients add up.\n\nWait, that seems more accurate. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because each term in the second expansion contributes its own coefficient, and when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), it just adds to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product.\n\nSo, first, let me compute the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The sum of the coefficients in a polynomial is found by setting all variables to 1. So, if I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the sum of the coefficients in the second part is 64.\n\nNow, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6, as I calculated earlier. So, the total coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 multiplied by 64, which is 384. \n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. Is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product equal to the coefficient in the first part times the sum of coefficients in the second part? Let me think about a simpler example to verify.\n\nSuppose I have \\((a + b)^1 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). The expansion is \\((a + b)(c + 1/c)\\). The coefficient of \\(a\\) would be 1 (from the first part) multiplied by the sum of coefficients in the second part, which is \\(1 + 1 = 2\\), so the coefficient of \\(a\\) would be 2, and similarly for \\(b\\). Let me check: expanding \\((a + b)(c + 1/c)\\), we get \\(ac + a/c + bc + b/c\\). The coefficients of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are indeed 1 each, but when multiplied by the sum of coefficients in the second part, it's 1*(1 + 1) = 2 for each, but in reality, the coefficients are 1 each. Wait, that doesn't match. So, my previous reasoning might be wrong.\n\nWait, in this example, the coefficient of \\(a\\) in the product is 1 (from the first part) multiplied by 1 (from the second part, because \\(c\\) is just \\(c^1\\)), but actually, in the product, the coefficient of \\(a\\) is 1, not 2. So, my earlier reasoning that the coefficient is the coefficient from the first part times the sum of coefficients in the second part is incorrect.\n\nHmm, so where did I go wrong? Let me think again. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part, which has terms like \\(c^k\\) or \\(c^{-k}\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part, because each term in the second part contributes its own coefficient when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\).\n\nWait, but in my simple example, that didn't hold. Let me check again. In the simple example, \\((a + b)(c + 1/c)\\), the coefficient of \\(a\\) is 1 (from \\(a \\times c\\)) plus 1 (from \\(a \\times 1/c\\)), so the coefficient of \\(a\\) is 2, which is indeed 1 (from the first part) times the sum of coefficients in the second part, which is 2. Similarly, the coefficient of \\(b\\) is 2 as well. So, in that case, my reasoning was correct.\n\nWait, but when I thought about the expansion, I saw that the coefficient of \\(a\\) is 1 for \\(ac\\) and 1 for \\(a/c\\), so total coefficient is 2, which is the same as 1 (from the first part) times 2 (sum of coefficients in the second part). So, in that case, it works. So, perhaps my initial confusion was because I was miscounting.\n\nSo, applying that to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is indeed the coefficient from the first part times the sum of coefficients in the second part. Therefore, 6 times 64 equals 384.\n\nWait, but let me make sure. Let me consider another example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). The first part is \\(a^2 + 2ab + b^2\\), and the second part is \\(c + 1/c\\). The product would be \\(a^2c + a^2/c + 2abc + 2ab/c + b^2c + b^2/c\\). The coefficient of \\(a^2\\) is 1 (from \\(a^2c\\)) plus 1 (from \\(a^2/c\\)), so total coefficient is 2, which is the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) in the first part (which is 1) times the sum of coefficients in the second part (which is 2). Similarly, the coefficient of \\(b^2\\) is 2, which is 1 times 2. So, this seems to confirm that the method works.\n\nTherefore, going back to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6, and the sum of coefficients in the second part is 64, so the total coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me check if the second part's sum of coefficients is indeed 64. The second part is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). To find the sum of coefficients, we set \\(c = 1\\), so it becomes \\((1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\), which is correct.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) as having terms with coefficients that are binomial coefficients, such as \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}\\) for each term. The sum of these coefficients is indeed 2^6 = 64.\n\nTherefore, I think my reasoning is correct, and the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 384.\n\nWait, but just to be thorough, let me consider the expansion in another way. Let me denote \\(X = (a + b)^4\\) and \\(Y = \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). The product \\(X \\times Y\\) will have terms of the form \\(a^kb^{4 - k} \\times c^m\\) or \\(a^kb^{4 - k} \\times c^{-m}\\), depending on the expansion of \\(Y\\). But the problem is only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in the product, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(X\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(Y\\), because each term in \\(Y\\) contributes its own coefficient when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\).\n\nThus, the coefficient is indeed 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me make sure that there isn't a different approach. Another way to think about it is that when you have two independent variables, \\(a, b\\) and \\(c\\), the coefficients multiply when you take the product of their expansions. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) in the product is the product of the coefficients of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(X\\) and \\(c^k\\) in \\(Y\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), we need to sum over all possible \\(k\\), which is the sum of coefficients in \\(Y\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(X\\) times the sum of coefficients in \\(Y\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So, I think I've confirmed it multiple ways, and I'm confident that the coefficient is 384.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{384}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break down the problem into two parts using the binomial theorem.\n\n1. **Expanding \\((a + b)^4\\):**\n   Using the binomial theorem, the general term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is given by:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k} b^k\n   \\]\n   We need the term where the exponents of both \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2.

I need the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which means I need the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2. So, in this case, \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). \n\nCalculating that, \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) is equal to 6. So, the coefficient from the first part is 6. \n\nNow, looking at the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). This also can be expanded using the binomial theorem. Each term will be \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\), where \\(m\\) goes from 0 to 6. Simplifying that, each term becomes \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m} = \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\).\n\nI notice that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). However, the second part of the expression only involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), so when we multiply the two expressions together, the variables involved will be \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\). But since we're only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), the part involving \\(c\\) doesn't affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). That means, when we multiply the two expanded expressions, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) will be the same as the coefficient from the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), multiplied by the sum of all coefficients from the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nWait, is that correct? Let me think again. When I multiply two polynomials, the coefficients multiply term by term. But in this case, the first polynomial has terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), while the second has terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). Since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are different variables, the terms \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part will multiply each term in the second part, each time with a different power of \\(c\\). However, since the problem only asks for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), that means we need to consider all possible terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any power of \\(c\\). \n\nBut wait, no. Actually, in the product, each term will be of the form \\( \\text{(term from first expansion)} \\times \\text{(term from second expansion)} \\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term from the second expansion, each of which has a coefficient and some power of \\(c\\). However, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which, in the context of the entire expression, would include all the terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present, regardless of the power of \\(c\\). \n\nWait, but actually, no, because \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are independent variables. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by \\(c^k\\) would be a separate term from \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by \\(c^{k'}\\) where \\(k \\neq k'\\). Therefore, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then the coefficient would be the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients from the second part. \n\nBut let me think again. When we multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum of the products of coefficients of terms whose variables multiply to give that specific term. In this case, since the first polynomial only has terms with \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the second polynomial only has terms with \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), the variables don't interfere with each other. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will have a coefficient equal to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial. \n\nWait, that makes sense because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second polynomial, each term contributes a coefficient to the product term \\(a^2b^2c^{k}\\), but since the problem is only asking for \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), we need to sum all the coefficients from the second polynomial. \n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the sum of all coefficients from the second part. \n\nNow, to find the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), I can substitute \\(c = 1\\) because substituting 1 for all variables gives the sum of coefficients. So, substituting \\(c = 1\\), we get \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). \n\nTherefore, the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial is 64. \n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). \n\nWait, but let me check if that's correct. Because sometimes when you have negative terms or other variables, substituting 1 might not work, but in this case, the second polynomial is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which when \\(c = 1\\) becomes \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\), which is correct. \n\nAlternatively, another way to think about it is that the sum of the coefficients in the second polynomial is equal to the value of the polynomial when \\(c = 1\\), which is indeed 64. \n\nTherefore, multiplying the two coefficients together, 6 and 64, gives 384. \n\nWait, but let me confirm by expanding the second polynomial a bit more. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) will have terms from \\(c^6\\) down to \\(c^{-6}\\), each with coefficients given by the binomial coefficients. The sum of all coefficients is indeed 64, as calculated earlier. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times 64, which is 384. \n\nWait, but hold on. Let me think again. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term in the product of the two expressions. But in the product, each term is a combination of a term from the first expansion and a term from the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, which are all the terms in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. \n\nYes, that makes sense because each term in the second expansion has a coefficient, and when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each of those terms, you're effectively scaling \\(a^2b^2\\) by each of those coefficients and then adding them all together. So, the total coefficient is the product of the two coefficients. \n\nSo, I think my reasoning is correct. The coefficient is 6 times 64, which is 384. \n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in calculating the sum of the coefficients in the second polynomial. So, if I expand \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the sum of coefficients is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). That's correct. \n\nAlternatively, I can think of it as the sum of the coefficients in the expansion, which is the same as evaluating the polynomial at \\(c = 1\\). So, that's correct. \n\nTherefore, I think my final answer is 384. \n\nWait, but let me just check if I misread the problem. It says the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so in the entire expression, that term would be \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by some combination of \\(c\\) terms. But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), the coefficient is indeed the product of the two coefficients as I calculated. \n\nAlternatively, if the problem had asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some specific \\(k\\), then I would have to compute it differently. But since it's just \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\), the coefficient is 6 times 64, which is 384. \n\nI think that's correct. So, I'll go with 384 as the coefficient.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is found using the binomial coefficient \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).

    "text": " \n\nIn this case, the first part of the expression is \\((a + b)^4\\). So, applying the binomial theorem, the expansion would be \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\\). I'm looking for the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2 because the problem asks for \\(a^2b^2\\). So, I need to find the term where \\(a\\) is squared and \\(b\\) is squared. \n\nLet me write that out. When \\(a^{4 - k}b^k = a^2b^2\\), that means \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). So, substituting \\(k = 2\\) into the binomial coefficient, I get \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6. \n\nWait, but the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I think I need to consider how this multiplication affects the coefficient. Hmm, but actually, when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficients multiply as well. However, in this case, the terms from \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) are separate because one involves \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) and the other involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, when you multiply them together, the coefficients multiply, but the variables are separate. \n\nWait, but the problem is asking only for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, actually, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part doesn't interact with the \\(c\\) terms because they are separate variables. That means the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would just be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, no, because when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first polynomial gets multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. \n\nWait, but actually, since the variables \\(a, b\\) and \\(c\\) are different, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will only come from the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the constant term (if any) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because if you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by any term involving \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), it won't be just \\(a^2b^2\\); it will have those \\(c\\) terms attached. So, the only way to get a term that is exactly \\(a^2b^2\\) is if it's multiplied by the constant term in the second expansion. \n\nSo, I think I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because when I multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by that constant term, it will remain \\(a^2b^2\\) times the constant. So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression will be 6 (from the first part) multiplied by the constant term from the second part. \n\nNow, let me find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Again, I can use the binomial theorem for this. The expansion is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying the exponents, that's \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m - m} = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). \n\nI'm looking for the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero because that's the constant term. So, set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). \n\nWait, no, that's not right. Let me check that again. \\(6! = 720\\), and \\(3! = 6\\), so \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 720 / (6 \\times 6) = 720 / 36 = 20\\). Yeah, that's correct. So, the constant term is 20. \n\nTherefore, going back to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the constant term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). That is, 6 multiplied by 20, which equals 120. \n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't miss anything. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\) with coefficient 6, and when multiplied by the constant term 20 from the other expansion, it becomes 6 * 20 = 120. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120. \n\nI think that makes sense. Let me just recap to ensure I didn't skip any steps. I expanded each part separately using the binomial theorem, found the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and the constant term in the second part, then multiplied those two coefficients together because when you multiply the two expressions, each term from the first is multiplied by each term from the second. Since \\(a^2b^2\\) only interacts with the constant term to stay \\(a^2b^2\\), the coefficients multiply. \n\nI don't think I made any mistakes in the calculations. The binomial coefficients were correct, and the exponents were handled properly. So, I feel confident that the coefficient is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is found by expanding each part using the binomial theorem. For \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient is 6. For \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the constant term is 20. Multiplying these gives 6 * 20 = 120.\n\n\\boxed{120}"

    "text": " \n\nLet me start by looking at \\((a + b)^4\\). Using the binomial theorem, this should expand to the sum from \\(k = 0\\) to \\(4\\) of \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\\). So, each term in the expansion will be of the form \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\\). I'm specifically interested in the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2. That means I need to find the term where \\(a^2b^2\\). \n\nSo, if \\(a^{4 - k}b^k = a^2b^2\\), then \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Let me compute that: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient is 6. \n\nOkay, so the first part is clear. Now, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but wait, in the entire product, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term is just a part of the first part, and then multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. But since I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I think that term doesn't get affected by the second part because the second part involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), which are different variables. So, maybe the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just the same as in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, that doesn't make sense because when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, actually, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will be multiplied by every term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which means that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression will be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nWait, is that right? Let me think again. If I have \\((a + b)^4 = 6a^2b^2 + \\text{other terms}\\), and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\text{some expansion}\\), then when I multiply them, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. \n\nBut wait, actually, no. Because each term in the product is a combination of a term from the first expansion and a term from the second. So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), it's only the part from the first expansion, because the second expansion doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\). So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is just the same as in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems incorrect because the product would have terms with \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) and \\(a^2b^2/c^k\\) etc., so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. \n\nWait, but no, because when you multiply, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion because each term in the second expansion is being multiplied by 6a^2b^2. So, if I denote the second expansion as \\(E = \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), then \\(E\\) is a sum of terms like \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - k}(1/c)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, the sum of all coefficients in \\(E\\) is obtained by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nWait, but I'm not sure. Let me check again. If I have \\((a + b)^4\\) expanded as \\(a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\), and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) expanded as, say, \\(c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15/c^2 + 6/c^4 + 1/c^6\\). Then, when I multiply these two, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times each term in the second expansion, because \\(6a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the coefficient would be 6*(sum of coefficients of the second expansion). \n\nBut the sum of coefficients in the second expansion is indeed 64, as when \\(c = 1\\), it becomes \\(2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6*64 = 384. \n\nWait, but the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but in the product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, which includes powers of \\(c\\). So, in the entire product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually have coefficients multiplied by different powers of \\(c\\). But the question is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, that means that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6*64=384. \n\nWait, but let me think again. If I have \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), when I multiply them, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, so each term will have \\(a^2b^2c^{6 - 2k}\\) for \\(k\\) from 0 to 6. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is indeed 6*64=384. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of it as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) being 6, and then the entire second expansion is just a factor that multiplies it, so the coefficient becomes 6 times the sum of the coefficients of the second expansion, which is 6*64=384. \n\nWait, but is there another way to approach this? Maybe using generating functions or multinomial coefficients. Let me try that. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can consider that the entire expression is a product of two independent expansions, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just the coefficient from the first part, because the second part doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\). Therefore, the coefficient remains 6. But that contradicts my earlier reasoning. \n\nWait, no, because when you multiply two expressions, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), it's the sum over all possible products where the first part contributes \\(a^2b^2\\) and the second part contributes any term. So, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6*64=384. \n\nWait, but let me think about it differently. Suppose I set \\(a = 1\\), \\(b = 1\\), \\(c = 1\\). Then the entire expression becomes \\((1 + 1)^4*(1 + 1)^6 = 16*64=1024\\). But the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, so 6 times the sum of coefficients in the second part is 6*64=384, which is less than 1024. So, perhaps that's correct. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Let me try to compute the product step by step. \n\nFirst, \\((a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). \n\nSecond, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - k}(1/c)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\\). \n\nSo, when we multiply these two, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, resulting in terms like \\(6a^2b^2c^{6 - 2k}\\) for each \\(k\\) from 0 to 6. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 times the sum of the coefficients from the second expansion. \n\nThe sum of the coefficients in the second expansion is when \\(c = 1\\), which is \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient is 6*64=384. \n\nWait, but let me check with specific terms. For example, when \\(k=0\\), the term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{0}c^6 = 1*c^6\\), so when multiplied by \\(6a^2b^2\\), it gives \\(6a^2b^2c^6\\). Similarly, for \\(k=1\\), it's \\(6c^4\\), so \\(6a^2b^2c^4\\), and so on, up to \\(k=6\\), which is \\(1/c^6\\), so \\(6a^2b^2/c^6\\). \n\nSo, each of these terms has a coefficient of 6, but they are multiplied by different powers of \\(c\\). However, the question is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, effectively, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the sum of all these coefficients, which is 6*(1 + 6 + 15 + 20 + 15 + 6 + 1) = 6*64=384. \n\nWait, but let me compute the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion. The coefficients are \\(\\dbinom{6}{0}=1\\), \\(\\dbinom{6}{1}=6\\), \\(\\dbinom{6}{2}=15\\), \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}=20\\), \\(\\dbinom{6}{4}=15\\), \\(\\dbinom{6}{5}=6\\), \\(\\dbinom{6}{6}=1\\). So, adding these up: 1 + 6 = 7, +15=22, +20=42, +15=57, +6=63, +1=64. So, yes, the sum is 64. Therefore, 6*64=384. \n\nWait, but another way to think about it is that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the same as the coefficient in the first part, because the second part doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. So, it's just 6 times the entire second expansion, meaning the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6*(sum of coefficients in second expansion) = 6*64=384. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I can consider that the entire expression is a product, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the product of the coefficients of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Since the second part doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), the sum of its coefficients is indeed 64. So, 6*64=384. \n\nWait, but I'm still a bit confused because when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in one polynomial is multiplied by all terms in the other polynomial. So, in this case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6, and when you multiply by the entire second expansion, each term in the second expansion is multiplied by 6, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. \n\nYes, that makes sense. So, the answer should be 384. \n\nWait, but let me check with a smaller example to make sure I'm not making a mistake. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^2*(c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, \\((a + b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2\\). The second part is \\(c + 1/c\\). So, the product would be \\(a^2c + a^2/c + 2ab c + 2ab/c + b^2c + b^2/c\\). Now, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^0\\) is \\(c + 1/c\\) times 1, but wait, in this case, I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^0\\), which would be \\(c + 1/c\\), but that's not a constant. Wait, maybe this example isn't helpful. \n\nAlternatively, let's take \\((a + b)^1*(c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, the product is \\((a + b)(c + 1/c) = a c + a/c + b c + b/c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^1b^0\\) is \\(c + 1/c\\), and the coefficient of \\(a^0b^1\\) is also \\(c + 1/c\\). But in this case, the coefficient of \\(a^1b^0\\) is not just 1 times the sum of coefficients in the second part, because the second part has variable terms. So, perhaps in the original problem, since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, it's 6 times the sum of coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, so 384. \n\nWait, but in the smaller example, the coefficient of \\(a^1b^0\\) is \\(c + 1/c\\), which is the same as the second expansion. So, in that case, the coefficient of \\(a^1b^0\\) is equal to the second expansion. So, perhaps in the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is equal to the coefficient in the first expansion times the entire second expansion. But that seems to contradict the earlier reasoning. \n\nWait, no, in the smaller example, the coefficient of \\(a^1b^0\\) is indeed \\(c + 1/c\\), which is the same as the second expansion. So, in that case, the coefficient of \\(a^1b^0\\) is the same as the second expansion. Similarly, in the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the second expansion, because the coefficient in the first part is 6. So, in the smaller example, the coefficient of \\(a^1b^0\\) is 1 times the second expansion, which is \\(c + 1/c\\). \n\nSo, applying that logic, in the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the second expansion. But the problem is asking for the coefficient, not the expression. So, if we consider the coefficient as a numerical value, regardless of the variables, then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. \n\nWait, but in the smaller example, the coefficient of \\(a^1b^0\\) is \\(c + 1/c\\), which isn't a numerical coefficient. So, perhaps in the original problem, the question is asking for the coefficient in the entire product, considering all possible terms. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, so 6*64=384. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some \\(k\\), but no, it's just \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 384. \n\nWait, but let me think differently. Suppose I consider the entire expression as a product of two polynomials, and I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Since the second polynomial doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial multiplied by the entire second polynomial. But that doesn't make sense because when you multiply by a polynomial, you have to consider all terms. \n\nWait, no, actually, when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in one polynomial is multiplied by all terms in the other polynomial. So, in this case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial is 6, and when you multiply by the second polynomial, which is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial. \n\nBecause each term in the second polynomial is being multiplied by 6a^2b^2, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the sum of the coefficients of the second polynomial. \n\nSo, the sum of the coefficients in the second polynomial is 64, as calculated earlier. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6*64=384. \n\nWait, but let me think again. If I have \\((a + b)^4 = 6a^2b^2 + \\text{other terms}\\), and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = E\\), then the product is \\(6a^2b^2 * E + \\text{other terms}\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in \\(E\\), which is 64, so 6*64=384. \n\nYes, that makes sense. So, the answer should be 384. \n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me compute the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion again. The second expansion is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). The sum of the coefficients is when \\(c = 1\\), which is \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, the sum is indeed 64. Therefore, 6*64=384. \n\nSo, I think I'm confident now that the coefficient is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\boxed{384}."

    "text": " \n\nAlright, let's start with the first part: \\((a + b)^4\\). Using the binomial theorem, this would expand to \\(\\dbinom{4}{0}a^4b^0 + \\dbinom{4}{1}a^3b^1 + \\dbinom{4}{2}a^2b^2 + \\dbinom{4}{3}a^1b^3 + \\dbinom{4}{4}a^0b^4\\). So, each term is of the form \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}a^{4 - k}b^k\\) where \\(k\\) goes from 0 to 4. \n\nBut I'm specifically looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, in this expansion, when does \\(a^2b^2\\) occur? Let me see. The exponents on \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are \\(4 - k\\) and \\(k\\), respectively. So, if I want \\(a^2b^2\\), that means \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). So, the term is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}a^2b^2\\). \n\nCalculating \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\), which is \\(\\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\).

Hmm, I need to figure out how this part affects the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, but \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are variables separate from \\(c\\), so actually, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\) at all.

Let me think again.\n\nWait, no, actually, since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are different variables, the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are independent of those involving \\(c\\). So, when I multiply the two expressions, each term in the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But since I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I don't care about the \\(c\\) terms; they can be anything because they don't affect the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, that can't be right because the entire expansion would have multiple terms, so I must be missing something.\n\nWait, no, that's not correct. Let me clarify. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be the product of \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part and any term from the second part. But since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems like a lot. Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it.\n\nWait, actually, no. Because when you multiply two expressions, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I need to consider all possible ways that \\(a^2b^2\\) can be formed by multiplying a term from \\((a + b)^4\\) and a term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the only way this can happen is if the term from the second expression is a constant term, i.e., the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. Because if the term from the second expression has a positive or negative exponent of \\(c\\), then the resulting term would have \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by \\(c^k\\) for some \\(k\\), which isn't the same as just \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is equal to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nOkay, that makes sense now. So, I need to find two things:\n\n1. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which I found earlier as 6.\n\n2. The constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nThen, I can multiply these two results together to get the final coefficient.\n\nSo, let me work on finding the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Again, I can use the binomial theorem for this. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k\\). Simplifying each term, that becomes \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} c^{-k} = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\).\n\nI need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero because that's the constant term. So, I set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\) and solve for \\(k\\):\n\n\\(6 - 2k = 0\\)\n\n\\(2k = 6\\)\n\n\\(k = 3\\)\n\nSo, the constant term is when \\(k = 3\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} c^{0} = \\dbinom{6}{3}\\).\n\nCalculating \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\), that's \\(\\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). Wait, no, that's not right because 6! is 720, but 3! is 6, so 6!/(3!3!) is 720/(6*6) = 720/36 = 20. Yes, that's correct. So, the constant term is 20.\n\nNow, going back to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficient from the first part and the constant term from the second part. So, that's 6 (from \\((a + b)^4\\)) multiplied by 20 (from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)).\n\nCalculating that, 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, let me double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\n1. Expanded \\((a + b)^4\\) using binomial theorem, found the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. That seems correct because \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n\n2. Expanded \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) using binomial theorem, found that the constant term occurs when \\(k = 3\\), which gives \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). That also seems correct because \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\) is indeed 20.\n\n3. Multiplied 6 and 20 to get 120. That seems straightforward.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Is the constant term really 20? Let me write out the expansion for \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) more explicitly. The expansion would be:\n\n\\(c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15(1/c^2) + 6(1/c^4) + 1/c^6\\).\n\nYes, so the constant term is indeed 20.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't miss anything else. The problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term without any \\(c\\) variables. So, when we multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), resulting in terms like \\(6a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(6a^2b^2c^4\\), etc. But the only term that is just \\(a^2b^2\\) (without any \\(c\\) terms) comes from multiplying \\(6a^2b^2\\) by the constant term 20, which gives \\(120a^2b^2\\). All other terms would have \\(c\\) raised to some power, so they aren't \\(a^2b^2\\) alone. Therefore, the coefficient is indeed 120.\n\nI think that's correct. Let me just recap:\n\n- Coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\n- Constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 20.\n\n- Multiply them together: 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break down the problem into two parts using the binomial theorem.\n\n1. **Expanding \\((a + b)^4\\):**\n   Using the binomial theorem, the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is:\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term containing \\(a^2b^2\\) occurs when \\(k = 2\\):\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\n   \\]\n   Thus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\n2. **Expanding \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   Using the binomial theorem, the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is:\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n   \\]\n   The constant term (where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero) occurs when \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\):\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{6}{3} c^0 = 20\n   \\]\n   Thus, the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20.\n\n3. **Combining the results:**\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) and the constant term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 20 = 120\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}."

I'm looking for the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2, so that would be when \\(4 - k = 2\\), which means \\(k = 2\\). So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Let me compute that: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient from the first part is 6.\n\nNow, moving on to the second part of the expression, which is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Again, I can use the binomial theorem here. The expansion would be \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying that, it becomes \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m}\\), which is the same as \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\).\n\nWait a minute, but in the original problem, I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Now, the second part of the expression is in terms of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), so it doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\). That means that when I multiply the two expressions together, each term from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term from the second expansion. But since I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and the second part doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), I think that the coefficient from the second part doesn't affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). In other words, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression will just be the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the entire second part, because every term in the second part is a constant with respect to \\(a\\) and \\(b\\).\n\nWait, but that doesn't seem right. Let me think again. When I multiply two expressions, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, if I have \\(6a^2b^2\\) from the first part, and then I multiply it by each term from the second part, which is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), then the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of the second part. But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and the second part doesn't have any \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), then all those multiplications will just result in terms that have \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by some power of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) itself, without any \\(c\\) terms, would just be 6 multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion, because \\(c^0 = 1\\), which is the constant term.\n\nSo, to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). That is, the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. From the expansion above, the general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, we set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which gives \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\), which is \\(\\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\).\n\nNow, since the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6, and the constant term in the second part is 20, then when we multiply these together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nWait, but let me double-check that. So, the first part gives me \\(6a^2b^2\\), and the second part has a constant term of 20, so when I multiply them, I get \\(6 \\times 20 a^2b^2\\), which is \\(120a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient is indeed 120. \n\nHmm, that seems correct, but let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes in my calculations. So, \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) is 6, that's correct. Then, for the second part, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\) is 20, which is also correct. So, 6 times 20 is 120. Yeah, that seems right.\n\nWait, another thought: when I expand \\((a + b)^4\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed present with coefficient 6, and when I expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the constant term is 20. So, when I multiply the two expansions together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by each term from the second part, but only the constant term from the second part will contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), because any other term would have a power of \\(c\\), making the term \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) where \\(k \\neq 0\\), which isn't what we're looking for. Therefore, only the constant term from the second part affects the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so the total coefficient is 6 times 20, which is 120. \n\nI think that's correct. So, the coefficient is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression is found by expanding each part separately and then multiplying the relevant coefficients.\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term \\(a^2b^2\\) occurs when \\(k = 2\\), so the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n\n2. **Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n   \\]\n   The constant term (where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0) occurs when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), so \\(m = 3\\).

Since I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I need to find the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2. That means \\(4 - k = 2\\) for \\(a\\), so \\(k = 2\\).

So, the coefficient is 6. \n\nWait, but the original expression also has \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) multiplied by \\((a + b)^4\\). So, does that mean I need to consider the expansion of both parts and multiply them together? Hmm, yes, because when you multiply two polynomials, each term from the first polynomial is multiplied by each term from the second. But I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is in the first part. The second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), when expanded, will have terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), but since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) don't appear there, those terms won't affect the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. \n\nWait, is that right?

But since I'm only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), the only way that term can appear is if I multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from \\((a + b)^4\\) by the constant term (the term with \\(c^0\\)) from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Because any other term from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) would have a \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\) component, which would make the term have \\(c\\) powers, but since we're only interested in the \\(a^2b^2\\) term, which doesn't involve \\(c\\), the only way that can happen is if we multiply by the constant term. \n\nSo, to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which I found to be 6, and then multiply it by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Therefore, I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). \n\nLet me work on that. The expression \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) can also be expanded using the binomial theorem. Each term will be of the form \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - k} \\left(1/c\\right)^k\\). Simplifying that, each term becomes \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - k} \\cdot c^{-k} = \\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\\). \n\nI need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0 because that's the constant term. So, I set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), I get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). Wait, no, that's not right. Let me calculate that again. 6! is 720, 3! is 6, so 720 divided by (6 times 6) is 720 divided by 36, which is indeed 20. So, the constant term is 20. \n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) and the constant term from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). That is, 6 multiplied by 20, which is 120. \n\nWait, let me double-check that. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 20. Multiplying them together gives 6 * 20 = 120.

So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial will be multiplied by each term in the second polynomial, which are powers of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would include all the terms where the product results in \\(a^2b^2\\) times some power of \\(c\\). But the question is a bit ambiguous. Wait, no, actually, the question is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, which would be a polynomial in \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\), and \\(1/c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually be a polynomial in \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), unless there's a term that cancels out the \\(c\\) terms.\n\nWait, no, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me clarify: the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), treating \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) as separate variables. So, in the expansion of the entire expression, each term will be of the form \\(a^kb^{4 - k}c^m\\) or something like that. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the sum over all terms where \\(k = 2\\) and \\(4 - k = 2\\), but considering all possible \\(m\\). Wait, no, that's not quite right.\n\nWait, no, actually, each term in the expansion is a product of a term from \\((a + b)^4\\) and a term from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be \\(6\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that can't be right because \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) has multiple terms, each with different powers of \\(c\\). So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be \\(6\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that seems odd because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would then be a polynomial in \\(c\\). Maybe I'm misunderstanding the question.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, in other words, it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by any power of \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would be \\(6\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), meaning that the coefficient is \\(6 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that seems too broad, and the problem is probably expecting a numerical coefficient, not a polynomial. So maybe I'm misinterpreting the question.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out to zero. That would make sense because then the coefficient would be a number. So, maybe the problem is implicitly asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by \\(c^0\\), which is the constant term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, if that's the case, then I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) and then multiply it by 6, which is the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\).\n\nOkay, that makes sense. So, let me proceed with that understanding. So, first, I found that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. Now, I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Once I have that, I can multiply it by 6 to get the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression.\n\nSo, how do I find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\)? I can use the binomial theorem again. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is:\n\n\\[\n\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n\\]\n\nSo, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). I need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, i.e., \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(6 = 2k\\) so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\).\n\nCalculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). Wait, no, that's not right. Let me compute it correctly. \\(6! = 720\\), \\(3! = 6\\), so \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{720}{(6)(6)} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). Yes, that's correct.\n\nSo, the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nWait, let me double-check that. So, the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the constant term from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 20. So, multiplying them gives 120. That seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, if I think about the entire expansion, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) with coefficient 6 is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, including the constant term 20. So, the term \\(6a^2b^2 \\times 20\\) would be \\(120a^2b^2\\), which is the term we're interested in. Therefore, the coefficient is indeed 120.\n\nI think that makes sense. So, the final answer should be 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is found using the binomial theorem, which gives 6. The constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is also found using the binomial theorem, yielding 20. Multiplying these together gives the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression as \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{120}\n\\]"

    "text": " \n\nLet me start by looking at \\((a + b)^4\\). If I expand this using the binomial theorem, each term will be of the form \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\\) where \\(k\\) goes from 0 to 4. I'm specifically looking for the term where \\(a^2b^2\\), so I need \\(a^{2}b^{2}\\). That means \\(4 - k = 2\\) for the exponent of \\(a\\), which implies \\(k = 2\\). So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Let me calculate that: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the term is \\(6a^2b^2\\). \n\nOkay, so now I know that the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6. But the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Hmm, so I need to consider the entire product. Wait, but the question is only about the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), right? So, does that mean I don't need to worry about the \\(c\\) terms when looking for \\(a^2b^2\\)? Or do I need to consider how the \\(c\\) terms might affect the coefficient? \n\nWait, maybe I should think about it this way: when I multiply out \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part will be multiplied by every term in the expansion of the second part. But since the question is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\), does that mean I just need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and then multiply it by the sum of all coefficients in the second part? Or maybe not, because when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), perhaps the coefficient will be the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients from the second part? \n\nWait, but actually, no. Because when you multiply two expressions, the coefficients multiply term by term. So, if I have \\(6a^2b^2\\) from the first part, and then I multiply it by, say, \\(d_0 + d_1c + d_2c^2 + \\dots + d_6c^6\\) (where \\(d_i\\) are the coefficients from expanding \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)), then the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each \\(d_i c^i\\), resulting in terms like \\(6d_0a^2b^2 + 6d_1a^2b^2c + 6d_2a^2b^2c^2 + \\dots + 6d_6a^2b^2c^6\\). \n\nBut the original question is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, in other words, they just want the coefficient of the term where the variables are \\(a^2b^2\\), irrespective of what's happening with \\(c\\). So, that would be \\(6d_0\\), because \\(d_0\\) is the constant term (the term without \\(c\\)) in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I need to find \\(d_0\\) in that expansion and then multiply it by 6 to get the final coefficient. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think again. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When I expand this, each term will be a product of a term from the first expansion and a term from the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the first part, and when multiplied by any term from the second part, it will have \\(a^2b^2\\) times some power of \\(c\\). But the question is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, actually, I think that the coefficient would be \\(6\\) times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. Because when you multiply \\(6a^2b^2\\) by the entire second expansion, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be \\(6\\) times the sum of the coefficients of all terms in the second expansion, since each term in the second expansion contributes to a different power of \\(c\\). \n\nWait, but that doesn't sound right. Let me check. If I have \\(6a^2b^2 \\times \\left(d_0 + d_1c + d_2c^2 + \\dots + d_6c^6\\right)\\), then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be \\(6d_0\\), because \\(d_0\\) is the only term that doesn't have any \\(c\\) in it. The other terms, like \\(6d_1a^2b^2c\\), would have \\(a^2b^2c\\), which isn't \\(a^2b^2\\). So, actually, only the constant term from the second expansion, \\(d_0\\), when multiplied by \\(6a^2b^2\\), gives a term with just \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(6d_0\\). \n\nSo, I need to find \\(d_0\\), which is the constant term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me figure out how to find \\(d_0\\). Again, using the binomial theorem, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). \n\nSo, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). I need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, because that's the constant term. So, set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term \\(d_0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Let me compute that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). So, \\(d_0 = 20\\). \n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). So, the final answer should be 120. \n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let me go through it again. \n\nFirst, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Then, in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the constant term is when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, which occurs when \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), so \\(k = 3\\), giving \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, multiplying these together, \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). \n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of the entire expression as a product of two expansions, and when I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), it's the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Wait, but no, because when you multiply, each term from the first is multiplied by each term from the second. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the sum of all coefficients in the second part. But wait, that would be if I were looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times any power of \\(c\\). But in this case, I'm only looking for \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\). So, that would actually be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion, which is exactly what I did earlier. So, yes, 6 times 20 is 120. \n\nI think that makes sense. So, the final answer is 120. \n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem.\n\nFirst, we expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n\\]\nWe are interested in the term where \\(a^2b^2\\), which occurs when \\(k = 2\\). The coefficient for this term is:\n\\[\n\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\n\\]\n\nNext, we consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):\n\\[\n\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n\\]\nWe need the constant term (the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero).

The coefficient for this term is:\n\\[\n\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\n\\]\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficients from the two expansions:\n\\[\n6 \\times 20 = 120\n\\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}."

I notice that this part involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), but since I'm only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), maybe I don't need to expand this part.

So, if I have \\(6a^2b^2\\) from the first part and then multiply by the entire expansion of the second part, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in the second expansion, because each term in the second expansion will multiply \\(a^2b^2\\), so the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second part. \n\nBut wait, actually, the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), when expanded, will have terms with different powers of \\(c\\), but the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in effect, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because each term in the second expansion will multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term, contributing to the overall coefficient. \n\nWait, but that might not be correct. Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, each of those terms will have different powers of \\(c\\), but the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, actually, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in the second expansion, because each term in the second expansion, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), will give a term like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2c^{-k}\\), but since we're only interested in \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion. \n\nWait, but that seems a bit confusing. Let me think again. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Since we're only concerned with the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), the part involving \\(c\\) doesn't affect the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nWait, but that can't be right because the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, if I do that, the coefficient would be 6 * 64 = 384. But that seems too large. Let me check if that's correct. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, perhaps the coefficient is just 6, because the \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) part doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. Wait, no, because when you multiply, each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) will multiply each term in \\((a + b)^4\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) will be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nWait, but let me test this with a smaller example to see if this makes sense. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be \\(\\dbinom{2}{2} = 1\\) times the sum of coefficients in \\((c + 1/c)\\), which is 2. So, the coefficient would be 2. Let's expand it:\n\n\\((a + b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2\\).\n\n\\((c + 1/c) = c + 1/c\\).\n\nMultiplying them: \\(a^2c + a^2/c + 2abc + 2ab/c + b^2c + b^2/c\\).\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually be zero because there's no \\(a^2b^2\\) term. Wait, that contradicts my earlier reasoning. So, my earlier approach must be wrong. \n\nWait, so in this small example, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is zero because \\(a^2b^2\\) would require both \\(a^2\\) and \\(b^2\\), but in the expansion, each term is either \\(a^2c\\), \\(a^2/c\\), etc., but not \\(a^2b^2\\). So, in that case, my initial approach was incorrect. Therefore, perhaps the correct approach is that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is just the coefficient from the first part, because the second part doesn't contribute to the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. \n\nWait, that can't be right either because in the small example, the coefficient is zero, which would mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just the coefficient from \\((a + b)^2\\), which is 1, but in reality, it's zero because there's no \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the product. So, my initial approach was wrong. \n\nSo, perhaps I need to reconsider. The problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\), and \\(1/c\\) are independent variables, the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from those involving \\(c\\). Therefore, when you multiply the two expressions, the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) come only from \\((a + b)^4\\), and the exponents of \\(c\\) come only from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by all possible terms from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, the coefficient would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). \n\nWait, but in the small example, that approach gave the wrong result. So, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\)?\" So, it's asking for the coefficient of the monomial \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, in other words, we're looking for all terms in the expansion where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2 and 2, respectively, and the exponents of \\(c\\) can be anything. So, the coefficient would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). \n\nWait, but in the small example, that approach didn't work. Let me try that again. In the small example, \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be zero because there is no \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the product. But according to the approach, it would be 1 (from \\((a + b)^2\\)) times 2 (from \\((c + 1/c)^1\\)), which is 2, but the actual coefficient is zero. So, that approach is incorrect. \n\nTherefore, perhaps the correct approach is that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is just the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the coefficient from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) for the term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), i.e., the constant term. Because if I'm looking for \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), then the coefficient would be the product of the coefficients from each part. \n\nWait, that makes more sense. So, in the small example, \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) would be 1 (from \\((a + b)^2\\)) times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\((c + 1/c)^1\\). But \\((c + 1/c)^1 = c + 1/c\\), which has no constant term, so the coefficient would be zero, which matches the actual expansion. \n\nSo, applying this to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). \n\nThat seems correct. So, first, find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, as I calculated earlier. Then, find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). \n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), I can use the binomial theorem again. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\times (1/c)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). \n\nWe want the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(k = 3\\). So, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). \n\nCalculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). \n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 20. \n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the second part), which is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). \n\nWait, but let me double-check this. So, in the first part, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, and in the second part, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Therefore, when you multiply the two expressions, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, but only the constant term \\(c^0\\) will result in a term that is just \\(a^2b^2\\). All other terms will have \\(c\\) raised to some power, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms is 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nYes, that makes sense now. So, the final answer should be 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Multiplying these gives 6 * 20 = 120.\n\n\\boxed{120}"

    "text": " \n\nAlright, so the first part of the expression is \\((a + b)^4\\). Let me expand that. Using the binomial theorem, the expansion will be \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\\). I need the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2, so that's \\(a^2b^2\\). To find the coefficient, I need to find the value of \\(k\\) such that \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). So, that term is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} a^2b^2\\). Calculating the binomial coefficient, \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\\). So, the coefficient from the first part is 6.\n\nNow, the second part of the expression is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I need to figure out how this part affects the overall coefficient. Wait a second, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\). So, does that mean I just need to consider the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and then multiply it by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)? Or is there a specific term in the second part that I need to consider?\n\nHmm, let me think. The expression is a product of two separate binomial expansions. So, when you multiply them together, each term in the first expansion will multiply each term in the second expansion. However, since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), that means we need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and then multiply it by the sum of all the coefficients in the second part. Because the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), when expanded, will have terms involving various powers of \\(c\\), but since the first part doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression will just be the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part.\n\nWait, is that right? Let me verify. The coefficient of a term in a product is the product of the coefficients of the terms if they don't interfere with each other. Since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are different variables, the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) don't affect the terms involving \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nBut wait, actually, no. That's not quite right. Because the entire expression is the product of two separate expansions, each term in the product will be a term from the first expansion multiplied by a term from the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. Because each term in the first expansion is multiplied by every term in the second expansion, but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), the only thing that affects it is the coefficient from the first part and the total sum of coefficients from the second part.\n\nSo, to find the total sum of coefficients in the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), I can set \\(c = 1\\). Because substituting \\(c = 1\\) into the expression will make all the terms just their coefficients, and the sum of those coefficients will be the value of the expression when \\(c = 1\\). Let me compute that.\n\nSubstituting \\(c = 1\\), we get \\(\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = (1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of all coefficients in the second part is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, multiplied by 64. So, 6 times 64 is 384.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. Is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product equal to the coefficient in the first part times the sum of coefficients in the second part? Let me think of a simpler example to verify.\n\nSuppose I have \\((a + b)^1 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). The coefficient of \\(a^1b^0\\) in the first part is 1 (since \\(\\dbinom{1}{0} = 1\\)), and the sum of coefficients in the second part is \\((1 + 1) = 2\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^1b^0\\) in the product should be 1 * 2 = 2. Let's expand the product: \\((a + b)(c + 1/c)\\). The term involving \\(a\\) would be \\(a \\times c + a \\times (1/c)\\), so the coefficient of \\(a\\) is \\(c + 1/c\\). Wait, but that's a variable, not a constant. Hmm, maybe my initial approach is wrong.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in understanding the problem. The problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\). So, in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term is of the form \\(\\text{term from first expansion} \\times \\text{term from second expansion}\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would come from taking \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion and multiplying it by every term in the second expansion. But since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion multiplied by the entire second expansion. But that can't be, because the second expansion has terms with \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), so the overall expression would have terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for various \\(k\\). But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would imply that we're considering the term where the exponents of \\(c\\) are zero, right? Because otherwise, \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by \\(c^k\\) would be a different term.\n\nWait, that makes more sense. So, I think I misunderstood earlier. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term without any \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\). So, in the product, we need to find the term where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out, meaning that in the second expansion, we need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. So, that term would be the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\).\n\nOkay, that makes more sense. So, let me recast my approach. First, find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which I already did as 6. Then, find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Let's do that.\n\nTo find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), I can use the binomial expansion again. The expansion is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(1/c\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We want the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, so set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} c^{0} = \\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n\nSo, the constant term in the second expansion is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the two coefficients: 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the second part), which is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but let me check this again. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first expansion, and the constant term in the second expansion. So, when we multiply them together, we get \\(a^2b^2 \\times 20\\), so the coefficient is 20 * 6 = 120. That seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, if I think about expanding the entire expression, each term in the product will be a combination of a term from the first expansion and a term from the second expansion. But since we're only interested in terms where the variables \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are squared and multiplied together, and the \\(c\\) terms must cancel out, so the only term that contributes is when we take \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part and the constant term from the second part.\n\nLet me see if there's another way to approach this. Maybe using multinomial coefficients or generating functions, but I think the binomial approach is sufficient here.\n\nSo, to recap: The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 20. Multiplying these together gives 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120.\n\nI think that makes sense. Let me just confirm by considering the entire expansion. If I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the only term that would result in \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms is when we take \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion and the constant term from the second. So, yes, that's correct.\n\nTherefore, I'm confident that the coefficient is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is found by first determining the coefficient in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplying it by the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20. Thus, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\boxed{120}"

So, the coefficient from the first part is 6.\n\nNow, moving on to the second part: \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Hmm, I wonder how this part interacts with the first part. Wait, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but this second part is in terms of \\(c\\). So, maybe I don't need to consider the \\(c\\) terms when looking for \\(a^2b^2\\)? Or perhaps the entire expression is a product of two expansions, and I need to consider how they multiply together. Let me think.\n\nWait, the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product. So, perhaps the \\(c\\) terms can be considered separately, and since we're only interested in the \\(a^2b^2\\) term, we can treat the second part as a constant with respect to \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). That is, the coefficient from the first part is 6, and the second part is a separate expansion. But actually, the entire expression is the product of two expansions, so maybe I need to consider how the terms multiply.\n\nWait, no, because \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are different variables, right? So, when you multiply out the entire expression, the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from those involving \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be the coefficient from the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part, because the \\(c\\) terms don't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. So, essentially, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times whatever the constant term is in the second part, or maybe the entire expansion? Wait, no, that doesn't make sense.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, actually, the \\(c\\) terms don't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms when multiplying. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be the same as in the first part, because the second part is a separate expansion and when you multiply, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But since we're only interested in the \\(a^2b^2\\) term, regardless of the power of \\(c\\), the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of the second part, but that can't be right because the problem is expecting a numerical coefficient, not an expression.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). That is, we can have any power of \\(c\\) multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), and we need to sum the coefficients of all such terms. Alternatively, perhaps it's just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), that is, the term where \\(c\\) cancels out, so the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero.\n\nWait, that makes more sense. Because if we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), without any \\(c\\) terms, then we need to consider the product of the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part and the constant term (i.e., the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero) from the second part. So, let me try that approach.\n\nSo, first, from the first part, we have the term \\(a^2b^2\\) with coefficient 6. Then, from the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we need to find the constant term, which is the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. Let me figure out how to find that.\n\nAgain, using the binomial theorem, the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k\\). Simplifying that, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} c^{-k} = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\).\n\nWe want the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, so we set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the product of the coefficients from each part, which is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nWait, but let me double-check that. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first part with coefficient 6, and the constant term from the second part is 20, so when you multiply them together, you get \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). That seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, if I were to think about the entire expansion, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part would be multiplied by every term in the second part, but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), that would actually be incorrect. Wait, no, because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would include all possible powers of \\(c\\). But that's not standard; usually, when asked for the coefficient of a specific term in a product, it's implied that you consider the term with the same variables, so \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by any power of \\(c\\), but that doesn't make sense because \\(c\\) is a separate variable. So, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times the constant term in \\(c\\), which is what I did earlier.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is expecting the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) irrespective of the \\(c\\) terms, meaning that the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. But that would make the coefficient a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the question is asking for a numerical coefficient.\n\nTherefore, I think the correct interpretation is that we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), that is, the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\), which is the constant term. So, that would be 6 times 20, which is 120.\n\nWait, just to make sure, let me think of it another way. Suppose I expand both parts separately:\n\nFirst part: \\((a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\).\n\nSecond part: \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15/c^2 + 6/c^4 + 1/c^6\\).\n\nNow, when I multiply these two expansions together, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, resulting in terms like \\(6a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(6a^2b^2c^4\\), \\(6a^2b^2c^2\\), \\(6a^2b^2 \\times 20\\), and so on. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would actually be the sum of all the coefficients from the second expansion, because each term in the second expansion is multiplied by \\(6a^2b^2\\). Wait, but that can't be right because the problem is expecting a single numerical coefficient, not a sum of coefficients.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. If the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, without considering the \\(c\\) terms, then it's actually the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion, because each term in the second expansion is multiplied by \\(6a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient would be \\(6 \\times (1 + 6 + 15 + 20 + 15 + 6 + 1) = 6 \\times 64 = 384\\). But that seems too high, and I'm not sure if that's what the problem is asking for.\n\nWait, no, that would be the case if we were considering the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), which is not standard. Typically, when asked for the coefficient of a specific term in a product of expressions, it's implied that you consider the term with the same variables, so \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by \\(c^0\\), which is the constant term. Therefore, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nLet me check online to see if this makes sense. Hmm, I can't actually look things up, but I can recall that when dealing with multiple variables, the coefficient of a specific combination of variables is found by considering the product of the coefficients from each part, provided that the exponents of the other variables cancel out or are zero. So, in this case, since we're looking for \\(a^2b^2\\), we need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, which is the constant term. Therefore, the coefficient is indeed 6 times 20, which is 120.\n\nSo, I think I'm confident that the coefficient is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplying it by the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20.

But since \\(a^2b^2\\) is only present in \\((a + b)^4\\), and when multiplied by any term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the resulting term would have \\(a^2b^2\\) times some term in \\(c\\). But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not considering the \\(c\\) terms. Wait, that can't be right because the entire expression is a product, so the terms are combined. Maybe I need to clarify: when they ask for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), they might mean the coefficient when considering all possible terms, but since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), perhaps the coefficient is just the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't seem correct either.\n\nWait, perhaps I should think of the product as two separate expansions. Let me denote \\(P = (a + b)^4\\) and \\(Q = \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the product is \\(P \\times Q\\). Now, when you multiply these two, each term in \\(P\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(Q\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(P\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(Q\\), which would give terms like \\(a^2b^2 \\times c^k\\) where \\(k\\) ranges from, say, -6 to 6. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would mean that we're only interested in the terms where the power of \\(c\\) is zero because otherwise, the term would have \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), not just \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, but that's not possible because in the product, each term would have both \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) parts and \\(c\\) parts. So, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which would mean that the coefficient is the coefficient from \\(P\\) times the sum of all coefficients from \\(Q\\), because each term in \\(Q\\) contributes a coefficient that would multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. But that doesn't seem right because the terms in \\(Q\\) have different powers of \\(c\\), so when you multiply, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term would have coefficients multiplied by each term in \\(Q\\), leading to terms with different \\(c\\) exponents. So, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) irrespective of \\(c\\), that would be the coefficient from \\(P\\) times the sum of all coefficients from \\(Q\\). But let me check: when you expand \\(Q\\), the sum of all coefficients is obtained by setting \\(c = 1\\), so \\(Q\\) evaluated at \\(c = 1\\) is \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the sum of all coefficients in \\(Q\\) is 64. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\(P \\times Q\\) would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(P\\) multiplied by 64.\n\nWait, but is that correct? Because when you multiply \\(P\\) by \\(Q\\), each term in \\(P\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(Q\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(P\\) times the coefficient of \\(c^k\\) in \\(Q\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would require \\(c^0\\), because otherwise, the term would have \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) where \\(k\\) is not zero. Wait, but that's not how it works because in the product, the variables are separate. So, if you have \\(a^2b^2\\) from \\(P\\), and you multiply it by any term from \\(Q\\), say \\(c^k\\), then the resulting term is \\(a^2b^2c^k\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) is the product of the coefficients from \\(P\\) and \\(Q\\). But if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), that would mean we're looking for all terms where the exponent of \\(a\\) is 2 and the exponent of \\(b\\) is 2, regardless of the exponent of \\(c\\). But that would be the sum over all \\(k\\) of (coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(P\\) times coefficient of \\(c^k\\) in \\(Q\\)). But that would be the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(P\\) times the sum of coefficients in \\(Q\\), which is 64, as I thought earlier.\n\nWait, but that seems a bit off because the problem is phrased as \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", which usually implies that you're considering the term \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by some power of \\(c\\), but perhaps in this context, it's just the coefficient regardless of \\(c\\). Alternatively, maybe the problem is only considering the part involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and not the \\(c\\) terms. Hmm, that might not be the case. Let me think again.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, which would mean that the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by some combination of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) terms. But since \\(a^2b^2\\) is independent of \\(c\\), the coefficient would just be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but that doesn't make sense because the coefficient is a number, not a polynomial. So, perhaps the problem is indeed asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\).\n\nWait, but let me check: when you expand \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Then, the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is indeed 64, as calculated earlier. So, if I multiply 6 by 64, I get 384. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 384. But wait, is that correct?\n\nWait, another way to think about it is that when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each polynomial. But in this case, since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), and we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, that would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Because each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is being multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), so the total contribution to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the sum of all coefficients in \\(Q\\) multiplied by the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(P\\).\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, considering all possible terms, which would include all possible powers of \\(c\\). But in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times each coefficient from \\(Q\\), but that would mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^k\\) in \\(Q\\). But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would require \\(c^0\\), so maybe I was wrong earlier. Let me clarify.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\). Using the binomial theorem, the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is:\n\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n\\]\n\nSo, the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) occurs is when \\(4 - k = 2\\), which means \\(k = 2\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n\nNext, consider the second part: \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let's expand this using the binomial theorem as well:\n\n\\[\n\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n\\]\n\nSo, the exponents of \\(c\\) in this expansion range from \\(6\\) (when \\(m = 0\\)) down to \\(-6\\) (when \\(m = 6\\)), in steps of 2.\n\nNow, when we multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), resulting in terms like \\(6 a^2b^2 c^{6 - 2m}\\), where \\(m\\) ranges from 0 to 6.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is actually the sum of all the coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because each term in that expansion contributes a coefficient that multiplies the 6 from \\(a^2b^2\\). But wait, that would mean the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nBut the sum of all coefficients in a polynomial is found by substituting \\(c = 1\\). So, substituting \\(c = 1\\) into \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) gives:\n\n\\[\n\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 64. Thus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. When you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum of the products of the coefficients of terms whose exponents add up to that term. But in this case, since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), any term from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) would just multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term, contributing to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for various \\(k\\). But if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), that would mean considering all possible \\(k\\), which would be the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) times the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\). So, that would indeed be 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then we would need to find the term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, which occurs when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), so \\(m = 3\\). The coefficient for \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Then, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) would be 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, now I'm confused. Which interpretation is correct? The problem says: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)\". So, it's ambiguous whether they want the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), which would be 384, or the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be 120.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider that in the product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) can only come from the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by any term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nBut another perspective is that the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is part of a larger expression, and when you multiply by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is now part of a product with terms involving \\(c\\). So, if you're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, you have to consider that \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), so the coefficient would be the sum over all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) times 6, which is 384.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it's 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but let me check the problem statement again: it says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", without any mention of \\(c\\). So, perhaps the intended interpretation is that we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), which would be 384. But I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting just the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and not considering the \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) part. But that seems unlikely because the problem includes both expressions.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, which would mean that it's considering all possible terms in the product. But \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), so when multiplied by the terms from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), it would produce terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), where \\(k\\) is an integer. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the sum of all coefficients from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) multiplied by the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting just the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) because the \\(c\\) terms are separate. But that doesn't make much sense because the entire expression is a product, so the coefficients would multiply.\n\nWait, perhaps another approach is to realize that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me think about this differently. Let's say I have two polynomials, \\(P(a, b)\\) and \\(Q(c)\\). The product \\(P(a, b) \\times Q(c)\\) will have terms where each term in \\(P\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(Q\\). So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), it's the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(P(a, b)\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(Q(c)\\), because each term in \\(Q(c)\\) contributes a coefficient that multiplies the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nBut I'm still a bit unsure because sometimes problems like this expect you to consider the entire term, including \\(c\\) exponents, but since the problem didn't specify, I think the intended answer is 384.\n\nWait, let me check with an example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^1 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, the coefficient of \\(a^1b^0\\) would be 1 times the sum of coefficients in \\((c + 1/c)^1\\), which is 1 + 1 = 2, so 1 * 2 = 2. But in reality, the product is \\(a(c + 1/c) + b(c + 1/c)\\), so the coefficient of \\(a\\) is 2, which is correct. Similarly, the coefficient of \\(b\\) is also 2. So, in that case, the approach works.\n\nTherefore, applying the same logic, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given product is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought that the term \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) would have a coefficient of 120. Let me verify that. The coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) would be 6 * 20 = 120. But the problem didn't specify \\(c^0\\), so perhaps 384 is the correct answer.\n\nWait, but perhaps the problem is only considering the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) parts, and the \\(c\\) terms are being treated as separate variables, so the coefficient is just 6. But that seems unlikely because the problem includes both parts in the product.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable, which would mean that the coefficient is 6 times each coefficient from the \\(c\\) terms, but that would mean that the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because coefficients are numerical.\n\nWait, no, coefficients are numerical, so when you multiply by a polynomial, the coefficients multiply. So, perhaps the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the \\(c\\) polynomial, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting just the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and not considering the \\(c\\) terms because they're separate. But that doesn't seem right because the product includes both parts.\n\nWait, perhaps I should think of the entire expression as a product of two independent polynomials. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nYes, I think that's the correct approach. So, the coefficient is 384.\n\nWait, but let me make sure. Let's take a simpler example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^1 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, the expansion is \\(a(c + 1/c) + b(c + 1/c)\\), which is \\(ac + a/c + bc + b/c\\). The coefficient of \\(a\\) in this product is \\(c + 1/c\\), which is a polynomial, not a number. So, in that case, the coefficient of \\(a\\) is a polynomial, not a numerical coefficient. Therefore, perhaps in the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is a polynomial in \\(c\\), and the problem is asking for that polynomial. But that's not what the problem states. The problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", which is a bit ambiguous.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), which would be 120, as calculated earlier.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is only considering the terms where \\(c\\) cancels out, i.e., \\(c^0\\), so the coefficient is 120. Let me think again.\n\nIf I consider that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it's 6 * 20 = 120. But if it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), then it's 384. Since the problem didn't specify, it's a bit ambiguous.\n\nWait, perhaps I should check the original problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" It says \"in\" the product, which usually implies considering all possible terms, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the sum of all coefficients from the \\(c\\) terms times the coefficient from \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, 384 would be the correct answer.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which would involve considering the entire expression, but since \\(a^2b^2\\) is independent of \\(c\\), the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients from the \\(c\\) terms, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nYes, I think that's the correct approach. So, the coefficient is 384.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought that if you set \\(c = 1\\), the sum of coefficients is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. That seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, if I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = 64\\), so the entire product becomes \\((a + b)^4 * 64\\). Then, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in this product is 6 * 64 = 384. So, that's another way to confirm.\n\nTherefore, I think the coefficient is 384.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break down the problem as follows:\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term \\(a^2b^2\\) occurs when \\(k = 2\\), so its coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n\n2. **Consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n   \\]\n   The sum of all coefficients in this expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), giving \\(2^6 = 64\\).\n\n3. **Combine the results:**\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) (which is 6) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) (which is 64), resulting in \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n**Answer:** \\(\\boxed{384}\\)"

    "text": " \n\nWait, but the problem is asking specifically for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). That means I need to find the term where \\(a\\) is squared and \\(b\\) is also squared in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\). Let me write that out. \n\nFor \\((a + b)^4\\), using the binomial theorem, the general term is \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\\). I need the term where \\(a^2b^2\\), so that would be when \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). So, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Let me calculate that. \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\nBut wait, the original expression is \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, does that mean I have to consider the entire expression and find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of what happens with \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\)? Hmm, because the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not involving \\(c\\). So, maybe the terms involving \\(c\\) don't affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Let me think about that.\n\nWait, when you multiply two expressions together, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression. So, if I have a term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part, and any term from the second part \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), then the product will have terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2 \\cdot c^{-k}\\), depending on the term in the second expansion. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, does that mean we're just looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times any power of \\(c\\), or specifically when the power of \\(c\\) is zero?\n\nWait, the problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", which I think implies that \\(a^2b^2\\) is a standalone term, not multiplied by any \\(c\\) terms. So, that would mean that in the entire expansion, we're looking for terms where the power of \\(a\\) is 2, the power of \\(b\\) is 2, and the power of \\(c\\) is zero. Because if \\(c\\) is raised to some power, then the term would be \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2c^{-k}\\), which is different from just \\(a^2b^2\\).\n\nWait, but in the original expression, we're multiplying \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, to get the term \\(a^2b^2\\), we need to find all possible products where the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) parts give \\(a^2b^2\\) and the \\(c\\) parts multiply to \\(c^0\\), which is 1. So, the coefficient would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part.\n\nWait, that makes sense. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, I already found that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. Now I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\).\n\nAlright, so let's work on that. The expression is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Again, I can use the binomial theorem here. The general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(1/c\\right)^k\\), which simplifies to \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} c^{-k}\\) = \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\).\n\nWe need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). So, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20.\n\nWait, let me check that calculation again. 6! is 720, and 3! is 6, so 720 divided by (6 times 6) is 720/36, which is indeed 20. So, that seems correct.\n\nNow, putting it all together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficients from each part. So, that's 6 (from the \\(a^2b^2\\) term) multiplied by 20 (from the \\(c^0\\) term). So, 6 times 20 is 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is 120.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't miss anything. The problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not considering any \\(c\\) terms. So, when we multiply the two expansions, each term from the first expansion is multiplied by each term from the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion is multiplied by every term in the second expansion, which includes various powers of \\(c\\). But we're only interested in the terms where the power of \\(c\\) is zero because that's the only term that would result in \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) factors. So, that's why we needed the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem had asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some specific \\(k\\), we would have to consider the corresponding term in the second expansion. But since it's just \\(a^2b^2\\), we're assuming \\(k = 0\\), so the term is standalone.\n\nWait, another way to think about it: when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum of the products of the coefficients of terms whose exponents add up to that term. But in this case, since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are different variables, their exponents don't interfere with each other. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is just the product of the coefficients of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and \\(c^0\\) in the second part. That makes sense because \\(c\\) and \\(a\\), \\(b\\) are independent variables.\n\nLet me just recap to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. First, expand \\((a + b)^4\\) and find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is 6. Then, expand \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) and find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\), which is 20. Multiply these two coefficients together to get 120. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120.\n\nI think that's correct. But just to double-check, maybe I can consider a small example or see if the logic holds. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^2 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^1\\). Then, expanding this, we have \\((a^2 + 2ab + b^2)(c + 1/c)\\). The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be 2 (from \\(2ab\\)) times 1 (from \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^1\\)), but wait, no, that's not right. Wait, in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^1\\), the coefficients are 1 for \\(c\\) and 1 for \\(1/c\\). So, the term \\(a^2\\) from the first expansion would multiply by \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), giving \\(a^2c\\) and \\(a^2/c\\). Similarly, \\(2ab\\) would give \\(2abc\\) and \\(2ab/c\\), and \\(b^2\\) would give \\(b^2c\\) and \\(b^2/c\\). So, in this case, there is no \\(a^2b^2\\) term because the first expansion only goes up to \\(b^2\\), and the second expansion only has one term. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be zero in this case. Hmm, but according to my earlier logic, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is zero because \\((a + b)^2\\) doesn't have an \\(a^2b^2\\) term, which is correct. So, that's consistent.\n\nWait, but in the original problem, \\((a + b)^4\\) does have an \\(a^2b^2\\) term, so when multiplied by the \\(c^0\\) term from the second expansion, we get a non-zero coefficient. So, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think about using multinomial coefficients, but I think the approach I took is correct because each part is independent.\n\nWait, another way to think about it is that when you have two separate variables or sets of variables, the coefficients multiply when you take the product of the expansions. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 20, so the product is 120, which would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is just \\(a^2b^2\\).\n\nI think that makes sense. So, I feel confident that the coefficient is 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break the problem into two parts using the binomial theorem.\n\n1. **Finding the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\):**\n\n   Using the binomial theorem, the general term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is given by:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   We need the term where \\(a^2b^2\\), which occurs when \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\).

I want the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2. So, that would be when \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). Let me check: if \\(k = 2\\), then \\(4 - 2 = 2\\), so yes, that's the term. \n\nSo, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, that part gives me a coefficient of 6 for \\(a^2b^2\\).\n\nNow, the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Since I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I might not need to consider how the other part affects the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. Instead, I just need to recognize that the coefficient I found, 6, will be multiplied by whatever the coefficient is for the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because if there's a constant term, it won't change the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). \n\nWait, but actually, I think I need to check if there's a constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because if there is, then when I multiply it by \\(a^2b^2\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will just get scaled by that constant. If there isn't a constant term, then maybe the coefficient would be zero, but that doesn't seem right because \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) should have a constant term.\n\nLet me apply the binomial theorem again to \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).

So, the constant term is 20.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficients from each part. That is, 6 (from \\((a + b)^4\\)) multiplied by 20 (from the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\)). So, 6 times 20 is 120.\n\nWait a second, let me make sure I didn't miss anything. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Since the first part gives \\(a^2b^2\\) with coefficient 6, and the second part has a constant term 20, when I multiply them, the term becomes 6 * 20 * \\(a^2b^2\\), so the coefficient is indeed 120. I don't think I need to consider any other terms because other terms in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) would involve \\(c\\) raised to some power, which would change the exponent, but since we're only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), the \\(c\\) terms don't affect the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). \n\nLet me just double-check my calculations to be sure. For \\((a + b)^4\\), \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) is indeed 6. For \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\) is 20. Multiplying 6 and 20 gives 120. I think that's correct.

Using the binomial theorem, this should expand to the sum from \\(k = 0\\) to \\(4\\) of \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\\). So, each term in this expansion will be of the form \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\\). \n\nNow, I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). That means I need the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2. So, in the expansion, I should look for the term where \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\).

But the question is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). That means I don't need to worry about the \\(c\\) terms because \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\). So, maybe I just need the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, and then the second part might contribute a factor that's multiplied by 1, since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\). \n\nWait, let me think again. The expression is a product of two binomial expansions: one in terms of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and another in terms of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, when I multiply them together, each term from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term from the second expansion. But since I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), that means I need to find the term in the second expansion that is \\(c^0\\), because \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\) would still be \\(a^2b^2\\). \n\nSo, let me work on the second part: \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Again, using the binomial theorem, this would be \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying each term, that becomes \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m}\\) which is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). \n\nI need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, because that's the only term that will multiply with \\(a^2b^2\\) to give \\(a^2b^2\\) (since \\(c^0 = 1\\)). So, I set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\) and solve for \\(m\\). \n\nSo, \\(6 - 2m = 0\\) implies \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the term I'm interested in is when \\(m = 3\\). The coefficient here is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). \n\nCalculating \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\): \\(\\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). \n\nSo, the coefficient from the second part is 20. \n\nNow, since I'm multiplying the two expansions together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression will be the product of the coefficients from each part. That is, 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the second part). \n\nSo, 6 times 20 is 120. \n\nWait, let me double-check that.

I'm looking for the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2, which means I need \\(a^2b^2\\).

I need to consider how this part affects the coefficient I just found. Wait, but the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). That means I don't need to consider the terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), right? Because the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\), and when I multiply it by the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term will be multiplied by each term from the other expansion.

Because each term in the second expansion will contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when multiplied by 6.\n\nWait, but actually, no. Because when you multiply two polynomials, each term from the first is multiplied by each term from the second. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, is that correct? Because each term from the second expansion is a term involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), so when you multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), you're getting terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) and \\(a^2b^2(1/c)^k\\), but the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) itself would require that the terms from the second expansion contribute 1, which only happens when the exponents of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) cancel out, i.e., when \\(k = 0\\). Wait, no, because in the second expansion, each term is a power of \\(c\\), so unless we're looking for a specific power of \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the sum of all the coefficients in the second expansion multiplied by 6.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me clarify: the problem asks for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will appear in the expansion, and its coefficient will be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, each term contributes to the overall coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times that term's coefficient. So, the total coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\).\n\nWait, but how do I find the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\)? The sum of the coefficients in a polynomial is found by setting all variables to 1. So, if I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(1 + 1/1\\right)^6 = (2)^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 64 (sum of coefficients from the second part), which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. Because when I set \\(c = 1\\), I get the sum of the coefficients, which is correct. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would indeed be 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, another way to think about it is that each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) contributes a coefficient, and when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), each of those coefficients adds to the total coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\).\n\nWait, but let me check if that's accurate. Let me consider a simpler example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). The expansion of \\((a + b)^2\\) is \\(a^2 + 2ab + b^2\\). The expansion of \\((c + 1/c)\\) is \\(c + 1/c\\). Now, multiplying them together, the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) would be 1 (from \\(a^2\\)) times (1 + 1) from \\((c + 1/c)\\), so 1 * 2 = 2. Similarly, the coefficient of \\(ab\\) would be 2 * 2 = 4, and the coefficient of \\(b^2\\) would be 1 * 2 = 2. So, in this case, the sum of coefficients in the second part is 2, and each term's coefficient is multiplied by that sum. So, yes, that seems to work.\n\nTherefore, applying that logic to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in calculating the sum of coefficients. So, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). The sum of coefficients is when \\(c = 1\\), so \\((1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). That's correct.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of it as the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) being equal to the value when \\(c = 1\\), which is indeed 64.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but just to be thorough, let me consider another approach. Maybe I can expand both expressions separately and then multiply the terms, but that might be more complicated. Alternatively, perhaps I can consider that since \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the first part, and the second part contributes a factor that is multiplied by each term, so the coefficient is 6 times the sum of coefficients in the second part, which is 64, giving 384.\n\nYes, I think that's correct. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\(2^6 = 64\\). Multiplying these together gives the coefficient as \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\boxed{384}."

    "text": " \n\nLet me start with the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\). Using the binomial theorem, this should expand to \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\\). So, the terms will be from \\(a^4\\) down to \\(b^4\\). I'm interested in the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2, which is \\(a^2b^2\\). So, I need to find the coefficient for when \\(4 - k = 2\\), which means \\(k = 2\\). \n\nCalculating the binomial coefficient for \\(k = 2\\), that's \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Let me compute that: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. \n\nNow, the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I need to consider how this multiplication affects the term \\(a^2b^2\\). Since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), their coefficients won't be affected by the terms involving \\(c\\). That means the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression will be 6 times the coefficient of \\(1\\) (the constant term) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nWait, is that right? Because when you multiply two expressions, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second. So, actually, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) will multiply with every term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), we need to find the terms in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) that result in a constant term (i.e., the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero). Because only then, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), it will still be \\(a^2b^2\\). \n\nSo, I think my initial thought was correct. I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me apply the binomial theorem again to this expression. \n\nThe expansion is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying that, it becomes \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m} = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). \n\nWe want the exponent of \\(c\\) to be zero, so we set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). \n\nSo, the constant term is when \\(m = 3\\), which gives us \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). \n\nTherefore, the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. \n\nNow, going back to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Since these two terms are multiplied together, the overall coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). \n\nWait, let me double-check that. So, \\((a + b)^4\\) gives \\(a^2b^2\\) with coefficient 6, and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) gives a constant term 20. So, when I multiply them, \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). That seems correct. \n\nAlternatively, another way to think about it is that the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are independent of \\(c\\), the coefficients for terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are unaffected by the \\(c\\) terms. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the coefficient from the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is indeed 6 times 20, so 120. \n\nI don't think I made any mistakes here. Let me just recap to make sure. \n\n1. Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) has a coefficient of 6.\n2. Expand \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem. The constant term (where exponents cancel out) occurs when \\(m = 3\\), giving a coefficient of 20.\n3. Multiply the two coefficients together because the terms are multiplied in the original expression.\n4. Final coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nYes, that all makes sense. I think I'm confident that 120 is the correct coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\).\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplying it by the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20. Thus, the overall coefficient is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\boxed{120}"
