    "text": " Or do I? Hmm, maybe not, because the question is only about the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. So, perhaps I can treat \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) as a constant when considering the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, but that doesn't seem right because the entire expression is the product of two polynomials. Wait, no, actually, when you multiply two expressions, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second. But in this case, since we're looking for a term that only has \\(a^2b^2\\), and no \\(c\\) terms, maybe we can consider that the coefficient from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is just 1, because any term that includes \\(c\\) would not be part of \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, no, that can't be right because \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) will have multiple terms, but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, perhaps the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) is just the product of the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) and the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, no, that doesn't make sense because each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, then I can just take the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) and multiply it by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is 6 times the expansion, which doesn't make sense because the coefficient should be a number, not a polynomial. Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so it's in the entire product. So, perhaps I can treat \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) as a separate polynomial and note that when multiplying by \\((a + b)^4\\), the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will come from the product of the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in \\((a + b)^4\\) and the constant term (with respect to \\(a\\) and \\(b\\)) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, that makes more sense. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I need to find two things: 1) The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which I already found as 6. 2) The constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Then, multiply these two together to get the final coefficient. So, let me work on finding the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Again, using the binomial theorem, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying each term: \\(c^{6 - m} \\times \\dfrac{1}{c^m} = c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, because that's the constant term. So, set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\): \\(6 = 2m\\) \u21d2 \\(m = 3\\). So, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20. Now, putting it all together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Wait, but let me double-check that. Because the problem is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), and we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would come from the product of the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first part and the constant term in the second part. So, 6 times 20 is indeed 120. So, I think that's the answer. But just to make sure I didn't make any mistakes, let me go through each step again. First, expanding \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Correct. Then, expanding \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the constant term is when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, which happens when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), so \\(m = 3\\), and the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Correct. So, multiplying these together, 6 * 20 = 120. That seems right. I don't think I made any mistakes here. So, the coefficient is 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem.\n\n1. **Expanding \\((a + b)^4\\)**:\n   Using the binomial theorem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is given by:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\n   \\]\n\n2. **Expanding \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)**:\n   We need the constant term (the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero). Using the binomial theorem:\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n   \\]\n   The term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero is when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which gives \\(m = 3\\). The coefficient is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\n   \\]\n\n3. **Combining the results**:\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficients from each expansion:\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 20 = 120\n   \\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

    "text": " Because \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\). So, when I multiply the two expansions, the terms involving \\(c\\) won't affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, no, actually, that's not quite right. Because when you multiply two expressions, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part will be multiplied by every term in the second part, which is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and the variables \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) are different from \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), the terms involving \\(c\\) won't interfere with the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but since we're only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), the \\(c\\) terms don't affect it. Wait, that seems confusing. Maybe I should think of it differently. Let me consider the entire expression: \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When you expand this, each term will be of the form \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}a^{4 - k}b^{k}\\) multiplied by \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - m}\\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\), right? So, that simplifies to \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}\\dbinom{6}{m}a^{4 - k}b^{k}c^{6 - 2m}\\). Now, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, we need \\(a^2b^2\\), which means \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\), as I found earlier. So, the coefficient from the first part is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Now, the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), when expanded, has terms \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - m}\\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\). Now, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part, so the entire expression will have terms like \\(6 \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\). But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), the coefficient is simply \\(6 \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}\\) for each \\(m\\). Wait, no, that doesn't make sense. Because the question is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but in the entire product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the sum of all the coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by 6. But that can't be right because the coefficient would then be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 times \\(2^6 = 64\\), so 384. But that seems too large. Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again. It says: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, perhaps the problem is treating the entire expression as a single polynomial, and we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, in other words, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by every possible term from the second expansion, so the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. Wait, but that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times \\( (1 + 1)^6 = 64\\), so 6 * 64 = 384. But that seems high. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without considering the \\(c\\) terms, meaning that the coefficient is just 6, because the \\(c\\) terms don't affect the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. But that seems too simplistic. Let me think again. When you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part, which includes various powers of \\(c\\). So, in the product, \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by \\(c^{6 - 2m}\\) for each \\(m\\), so the term \\(a^2b^2c^{6 - 2m}\\) will have a coefficient of \\(6 \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, that means we're looking for all terms where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2, regardless of the exponents of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient would be the sum of all the coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by 6. So, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion. The sum of the coefficients in the second expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), so \\(\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 * 64 = 384. Wait, but that seems like a lot. Let me check again. Alternatively, maybe the problem is only considering the term \\(a^2b^2\\) and wants the coefficient without any \\(c\\) terms, but that doesn't make sense because \\(c\\) and \\(a, b\\) are separate variables. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually include all possible terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any power of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient is indeed the sum of all the coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by 6. Therefore, 6 * 64 = 384. Hmm, but I'm not sure if that's correct. Let me think differently. Suppose I consider the entire expression as a product of two independent expansions. The first expansion gives me \\(a^2b^2\\) with coefficient 6, and the second expansion gives me various terms with coefficients. Since the variables are independent, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by every term in the second expansion, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. Since the sum of coefficients in the second expansion is 64, as I calculated before, the total coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384. So, I think that's the correct answer. But let me try another approach to confirm. Let me compute the product step by step. First, expand \\((a + b)^4\\) to get the term \\(a^2b^2\\) with coefficient 6. Then, expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The expansion is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - m}\\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, each term in this expansion is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\). Now, when I multiply the two expansions together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, resulting in \\(6 \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}a^2b^2c^{6 - 2m}\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is \\(6 \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}\\) for each \\(m\\), but since \\(m\\) can range from 0 to 6, the total coefficient is \\(6 \\times \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m}\\). But \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). Okay, that seems consistent. So, I think the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is found by considering the binomial expansions of each part. \n\n1. Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n\n2. Recognize that the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) must be considered, but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), the terms involving \\(c\\) don't affect this coefficient.\n\n3.

But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient, which is just a number. Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the question. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, perhaps the problem is treating \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) as variables, and it's asking for the coefficient of the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) appears, regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, that would mean that the coefficient is the product of the coefficients from each part, but since the second part is a sum of terms involving \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of the second part. But that seems odd because the coefficient should be a number, not a polynomial. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when considering the entire expression as a polynomial in \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\). So, the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\), but the problem is asking for the coefficient, which is just the numerical part. Wait, no, the problem doesn't specify any variables to hold, so maybe it's just considering the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\). That is, the coefficient would be the product of the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) and the sum of the coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, that might make sense. Let me try to clarify. When you have two polynomials multiplied together, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each polynomial. But in this case, the second polynomial doesn't have \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), so when you multiply, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial multiplied by the entire second polynomial. But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\). However, the problem is asking for the coefficient, which is a number, so perhaps I'm missing something. Wait, maybe the problem is considering the entire expression as a product, and it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). That is, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, and the coefficient would be a term that includes powers of \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient, which is just a number, so perhaps it's considering the coefficient as a number multiplied by some power of \\(c\\). Alternatively, maybe the problem is expecting me to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) and ignore the \\(c\\) terms, but that doesn't make sense because the \\(c\\) terms are part of the expression. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), that is, the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\). So, in that case, I would need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product. That might make sense. Let me try that approach. So, to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), I would need to consider the product of the terms from each part that contribute to this. So, from \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, as I found earlier. From \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), I need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0 because \\(c^0 = 1\\). So, let's find the term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) that has \\(c^0\\). Using the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We want the exponent of \\(c\\) to be 0, so set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\). So, the term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} c^{0} = 20\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part is 20. Now, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire product would be the product of the coefficients from each part, which is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression is 120. Wait, but the problem didn't specify anything about \\(c\\), just asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, perhaps my initial approach was incorrect, and the problem is indeed asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. But that would mean that the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a number. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the entire expression as a product, and it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), treating \\(c\\) as a variable, so the coefficient would be a term involving \\(c\\). But that seems unlikely because the problem is probably expecting a numerical coefficient. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it, and the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then considering the entire expression as a product, but that doesn't seem right because the second part would affect the coefficient. Wait, no, because when you multiply two expressions, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire second part. But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a number. Therefore, I think the problem must be asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), that is, the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times 20, which is 120. Therefore, the answer is 120. But let me double-check. So, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. In \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. So, when you multiply these two parts, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part, including the constant term. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is indeed 6 times 20, which is 120.

Wait, no, that doesn't make sense. Because if I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), we need to find the term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) that is a constant term, i.e., the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. Because when we multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by that constant term, it will still be \\(a^2b^2\\) times that constant, so the coefficient will be 6 times that constant term. So, first, I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me expand that using the binomial theorem as well. \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying each term, that becomes \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m} = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be zero, so set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Now, going back to the original expression, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the constant term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, that's 6 times 20, which is 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120. Wait, let me double-check. So, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, correct. In \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the constant term is when \\(m = 3\\), which is 20. So, multiplying 6 and 20 gives 120. That seems right. I don't think I made any mistakes in the calculations. So, yeah, the coefficient is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is found by considering the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) and the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).

Multiplying these gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\boxed{120}"

But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), maybe the coefficient from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) doesn't affect it. Or does it? Wait, no, that can't be right. Because the entire expression is a product, so any term that includes \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by a term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't have any \\(c\\) terms, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would just be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all terms in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, that doesn't make sense because the sum of all terms in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) would be a number, but when you multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), it would just scale it by that number. Wait, no, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me think again. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when you multiply these two expressions, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), the only way that term can come up is if we multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from \\((a + b)^4\\) by the constant term (i.e., the term with \\(c^0\\)) from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because if you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by a term that has \\(c\\) in it, you'd get \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or something, but we only want \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I already found that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. Now, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me apply the binomial theorem again. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying that, it becomes \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m - m} = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We want the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so we set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). So, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Now, putting it all together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the second part), which is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Wait, but let me double-check that. Is the term \\(a^2b^2\\) only multiplied by the constant term? Yes, because any other term would introduce a \\(c\\) component, which we don't want. So, yes, the coefficient is indeed 6 * 20 = 120. Alternatively, maybe I can think of it as the product of the two coefficients because they are independent.

But that doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which would include all possible terms from the second expression. Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me check the problem again: it says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\". So, perhaps the problem is considering the entire expression, and it's possible that \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term that's multiplied by some combination of \\(c\\) terms. But wait, in the product, each term would be of the form \\(a^kb^{4 - k}c^m\\) or something like that.

Wait, no, that's not quite right. Because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would be a specific term.

But that seems too broad. Alternatively, maybe the problem is only considering the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which would mean that the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. Wait, but I'm not sure. Let me think again. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, which would include all possible terms from the second expansion. But that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. Let me check that. The sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of all coefficients is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times 64, which is 384. Wait, but that seems too large. Let me verify. Alternatively, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Maybe it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, which would involve all possible terms, but since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by every term in the second expansion, so the coefficient would indeed be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion. So, 6 times 64 is 384. But let me check that again. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it, and the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, giving 384. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only considering the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without considering the \\(c\\) terms, which would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion. Alternatively, maybe the problem is considering only the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) and ignoring the \\(c\\) part, but that doesn't seem right because the entire product includes both \\(a, b\\) and \\(c\\). Wait, perhaps I'm making a mistake here. Let me think differently. Let me consider that the expression is a product of two separate expansions: one in terms of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the other in terms of \\(c\\). So, when you multiply them together, each term from the first expansion is multiplied by each term from the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion would be multiplied by every term from the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, you're effectively adding all the coefficients from the second expansion to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient would be 6 times 64, which is 384. But let me double-check this logic. So, if I have two polynomials, P(a, b) and Q(c), then the product P(a, b) * Q(c) would have terms where each term in P is multiplied by each term in Q. So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), it would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in P(a, b) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in Q(c). Because each term in Q(c) is a coefficient times some power of c, and when you multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), it just adds the coefficients. So, yes, that makes sense. Therefore, the coefficient would be 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, maybe I'm supposed to consider the entire expansion and find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the powers of c. But that's not possible because each term in the product would have both a and b exponents and c exponents. So, the problem is probably asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times any power of c, which would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, giving 384. Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it, and the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, so 6*64=384. Therefore, I think the coefficient is 384.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break down the problem as follows:\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\), so the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n\n2. **Consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   Since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, we need to account for all terms in this expansion.

So, when I expand this product, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), that means we're only looking for the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, because any other term would have a \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\) factor, which would make the term have a non-zero exponent for \\(c\\), thus not being part of \\(a^2b^2\\).

The problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", which implies that we're looking for the term \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by some expression involving \\(c\\), but the question is only about the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so perhaps the answer is just 6, because the other part doesn't affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, but that can't be right because the entire expression is the product of two polynomials, so the coefficients would multiply. Hmm, maybe I need to clarify this. Let's think of it as \\((a + b)^4\\) times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when you multiply these two expressions, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by every term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't make sense because that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), not a constant. So, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). In that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But the sum of the coefficients is found by substituting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). So, then the coefficient would be 6 * 64 = 384. But let me check again. Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it, and the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and the other part is just a constant multiplier. Wait, but \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is not a constant; it's a Laurent polynomial in \\(c\\). So, if the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, then the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to have you consider the entire expression, and the coefficient is 6 * [coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\)], because if you're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), perhaps you're also considering that \\(c\\) terms might affect the overall term, but since the question is only about \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\), then it's 6 times the sum of all coefficients, which is 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to have you consider that the entire expression is being expanded, and the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just 6, because the other part doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. Hmm, I'm confused now. Let me think again. The problem is: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, when you multiply two expressions, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\) and is multiplied by every term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the entire expansion of the second part. But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\). However, the problem is just asking for the coefficient, not considering \\(c\\). So, perhaps the question is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and the rest is irrelevant. But that seems unlikely because the entire expression includes both parts. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^k\\) for some \\(k\\), but it's not specified. Wait, the problem doesn't mention \\(c\\) in the term we're looking for, only \\(a^2b^2\\). So, maybe the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to have you consider that when you multiply the two expressions, the \\(c\\) terms don't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) remains 6. Hmm, but that doesn't seem right because the entire expression is a product, so the coefficients would multiply. Wait, no, actually, no. Because the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is from \\((a + b)^4\\), and when you multiply it by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to have you consider that the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is the coefficient of \\(c^0\\). So, maybe I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), then multiply that by 6. Let me try that. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(1/c\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, the exponent of \\(c\\) is \\(6 - 2k\\). We want the term where the exponent is 0, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 * 20 = 120. Hmm, that seems more reasonable. So, maybe I was overcomplicating it earlier. So, the correct approach is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiply it by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 20, giving 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient is 120. Let me verify this again. So, \\((a + b)^4\\) has \\(a^2b^2\\) with coefficient 6. \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) has a constant term (i.e., \\(c^0\\)) with coefficient 20. So, when you multiply these two expressions, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by 20, so the coefficient becomes 6 * 20 = 120. That makes sense. So, I think the answer is 120. Let me just recap to make sure I didn't miss anything. The problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), we can treat the \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) part as a constant multiplier for that specific term. Therefore, we find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiply it by the coefficient of the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 20, giving 120. Yeah, that seems correct. I think I was confused earlier because I was considering the entire expansion, but since the problem only asks for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, the correct approach is to multiply the specific coefficients from each part. So, the final answer is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is found using the binomial theorem, which gives \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). \n\nNext, we consider the expression \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). We need the constant term (where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0). Using the binomial theorem, the general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\\). Setting the exponent to 0, we solve \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), giving \\(k = 3\\). The coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n\nMultiplying the two coefficients together: \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

    "text": " Wait, no, actually, I think I might be misunderstanding. Because the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), and we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, does that mean we're considering terms where only \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are present, and the rest are from the second part? Or do we need to consider the entire expansion, including the \\(c\\) terms? Hmm, let me think. The problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", which suggests that we're looking for the term where \\(a\\) is squared and \\(b\\) is squared, regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). But wait, actually, in the entire expression, each term will be a product of a term from \\((a + b)^4\\) and a term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when we multiply them, each term will be of the form \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}a^{4 - k}b^k \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - m}\\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying that, it becomes \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}\\dbinom{6}{m} a^{4 - k}b^k c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the exponent of \\(c\\) is \\(6 - 2m\\). But the problem is only asking about the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so we need to find all the terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) appears, regardless of the power of \\(c\\). Wait, but no, that's not correct. Because when you multiply two polynomials, each term from the first polynomial is multiplied by each term from the second, so the exponents of \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are independent. Therefore, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) can only come from the \\((a + b)^4\\) part, and the \\(c\\) part can have any exponent, but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), we can ignore the \\(c\\) part. Wait, no, that doesn't seem right. Let me clarify: when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficients of the product are the products of the coefficients of each term. So, in this case, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) has a coefficient of 6, as we found earlier. But when we multiply by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which expands to a sum of terms with different powers of \\(c\\), each of those terms will multiply the 6, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product will actually be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, that doesn't sound right either. Let me think again. Actually, no, because the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is only multiplied by the constant term (if any) from the second expansion. Wait, no, that's not correct. Let me approach this differently. Let's consider that when we multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term is the product of the coefficients from each polynomial for the respective terms that combine to form that term. So, in this case, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from \\((a + b)^4\\), and the term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) can be any term, but since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, we need to consider that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, that can't be right because then the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 times \\(2^6 = 64\\), giving 384. But that seems too large, and I think I'm making a mistake here. Let me try to clarify. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when we multiply these two expressions, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expression comes from \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}a^2b^2\\), which is 6a^2b^2. Now, when we multiply this by each term in the second expression, which is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we get terms like 6a^2b^2 \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product will be 6 multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, the coefficient would be 6 * 64 = 384. But that seems high. Let me check. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, because each term in the second expansion is multiplied by 6a^2b^2, contributing to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) across all powers of \\(c\\). Therefore, the total coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384. But wait, that doesn't seem right because the question is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would include all possible powers of \\(c\\). So, in the product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term from the second expansion, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is indeed 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. Since the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is when \\(c = 1\\), which is 2^6 = 64. Therefore, the coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384. Hmm, but I'm not sure if that's correct because I might be confusing the way the coefficients interact. Let me try another approach. Let's consider that the entire expression is a product of two polynomials. The first polynomial is in variables \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the second is in \\(c\\). Therefore, when we multiply them, the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are independent of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is simply the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial multiplied by the entire second polynomial. But wait, that would mean the coefficient is 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which isn't a constant. So, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question. Maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), meaning we treat \\(c\\) as another variable and find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for any \\(k\\). But that would make the coefficient 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times any power of \\(c\\), then the coefficient would indeed be 384. But maybe the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times a specific power of \\(c\\), but it doesn't specify, so perhaps it's just 6 times the sum of coefficients in the second polynomial. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to consider only the terms where \\(c\\) is raised to a specific power, but since it's not specified, I think the correct interpretation is that we need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), which would be 6 times the sum of coefficients in the second polynomial. So, let's compute that. The sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 * 64 = 384. So, the final answer would be 384. Wait, but let me double-check. Alternatively, maybe I'm supposed to consider that the second polynomial doesn't affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but that doesn't make sense because when you multiply, each term from the first polynomial is multiplied by each term from the second. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is indeed the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial multiplied by the entire second polynomial, which is 6 * \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, not a constant. Therefore, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), meaning the constant term. That would make more sense. So, in that case, we need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by the constant term from the second polynomial. So, let's approach it that way. First, find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6. Then, find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). To find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem. The general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - m}\\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\). We need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be 0, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which gives \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Now, multiplying the two coefficients together, we get 6 * 20 = 120. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is 120. But the problem didn't specify \\(c^0\\), it just said the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Hmm, this is confusing. Let me check the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, it's not specifying any power of \\(c\\), which suggests that we're considering the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). In that case, the coefficient would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial, because each term in the second polynomial is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), contributing to the coefficient across all powers of \\(c\\). Therefore, the sum of coefficients in the second polynomial is 2^6 = 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. But that seems like a lot. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to have \\(c\\) terms cancel out, but I don't think so. Let me think again. If we consider the entire product, each term will be of the form \\(a^{4 - k}b^k c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\) in the first polynomial, which gives a coefficient of 6. Then, in the second polynomial, for each \\(m\\), we have a coefficient of \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\), and the exponent of \\(c\\) is \\(6 - 2m\\). Therefore, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be multiplied by each term from the second polynomial, resulting in terms like \\(6 \\dbinom{6}{m} a^2b^2 c^{6 - 2m}\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the sum over all \\(m\\) of \\(6 \\dbinom{6}{m}\\). But that sum is 6 times the sum of \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\) for \\(m = 0\\) to \\(6\\), which is 6 * 2^6 = 6 * 64 = 384. Therefore, the coefficient is 384. But wait, that seems correct because each term in the second polynomial contributes to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when multiplied by the 6 from the first polynomial. So, the total coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, if the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), then it's 120, but since it's not specified, I think the correct answer is 384. But I'm a bit confused because sometimes problems like this assume that you're only considering the term where the other variables are at their lowest or something, but I don't think that's the case here. Let me try to see if I can find another way to approach this. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to have the term \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by the term where \\(c\\) is at a specific power, but since it's not specified, I think the only logical conclusion is that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 6 * 64 = 384.

Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, it's the product of two expressions. So, when you multiply them, each term from the first expression is multiplied by each term from the second. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the sum of all coefficients in the second part, because any term in the second part, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), will contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. Wait, that makes sense because when you multiply by a term that has \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), it doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) exponents. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Now, the sum of all coefficients in a polynomial is found by plugging in 1 for all variables. So, in this case, the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) would be when \\(c = 1\\). Let me compute that: \\(\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = (2)^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of all coefficients in the second part is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 * 64 = 384. Wait, but let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. Alternatively, maybe I should consider that when you multiply two expressions, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each factor. But in this case, since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are only in the first factor, and the second factor has only \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), the terms in the second factor don't affect the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\).

So, yes, that would be 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, maybe I should think about it another way. Let's consider that the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). When expanded, each term will be of the form \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}a^{4 - k}b^k \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - m}(1/c)^m\\), which simplifies to \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}\\dbinom{6}{m}a^{4 - k}b^k c^{6 - 2m}\\). Now, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) occurs when \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). So, \\(k = 2\\), and the coefficient from the first part is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Now, for the second part, \\(c^{6 - 2m}\\), but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is independent of \\(c\\), the exponent of \\(c\\) doesn't matter. So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which is indeed 64, as I found earlier. So, 6 * 64 = 384. Therefore, the coefficient is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 64. Multiplying these gives \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n\\boxed{384}"

But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), that term doesn't involve \\(c\\), so the \\(c\\) terms would just contribute a factor that isn't part of \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, no, that's not quite right. Let me think again. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, when you expand this, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But since we're only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term without \\(c\\), we need to find the part of the product where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by a term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) that has \\(c^0\\), i.e., the constant term. Because if we multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by a term with \\(c^k\\), that would give a term with \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), which isn't what we want. So, we need the term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. Let me find that term. Using the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(1/c\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, we need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. That is, \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). So, the term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} c^{0} = \\dbinom{6}{3} \\times 1 = 20\\). Therefore, the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 20. Now, going back to the original expression, \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\) and is multiplied by the constant term 20 from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficients from each part, which is 6 (from \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\)) multiplied by 20 (the constant term from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\)). So, 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem, which is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Next, identify the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which occurs when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. This term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).

So, maybe the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, no, that doesn't make sense because when you multiply two polynomials, each term in one is multiplied by each term in the other. However, since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and that term doesn't involve \\(c\\), it means that the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, no, that can't be right because when you multiply, each term from \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by every term in the second expansion. But since we're only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), that means we're just looking for the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because \\(a^2b^2\\) times the constant term would still be \\(a^2b^2\\).

So, I think I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), and then multiply it by 6 to get the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression. Let me check that again. So, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). When I expand this, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\), which has coefficient 6, and it's multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But since we only want the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), we need to consider how many times \\(a^2b^2\\) appears without any \\(c\\) terms. That is, when it's multiplied by the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 multiplied by the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, now I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Let me use the binomial theorem again. \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(1/c\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). The constant term occurs when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. So, set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} c^{0} = \\dbinom{6}{3} \\times 1\\). Calculating \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\), that's \\(\\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 (from \\((a + b)^4\\)) multiplied by 20 (the constant term from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\)), which is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Wait, is that right? Let me double-check. So, \\((a + b)^4\\) gives \\(a^2b^2\\) with coefficient 6. \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) has a constant term of 20. So, when you multiply 6 by 20, you get 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120. Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe I can think of it as the product of the two expansions, and since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), it's just the product of the coefficients from each part.

Wait, that can't be right because the coefficient would then be 6 times something, but the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\). Maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think differently. Perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, meaning that \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) are separate variables, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't seem right because the problem is likely expecting a numerical coefficient, not an expression involving \\(c\\). Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, meaning that the coefficient is just 6, and the rest is separate. But that seems unlikely because the entire expression is a product, so the coefficients would combine. Wait, perhaps I'm supposed to consider that when you multiply the two expressions, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term is multiplied by each term in the \\(c\\) expansion, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the \\(c\\) part. But that doesn't make sense because the sum of coefficients in the \\(c\\) part is when \\(c = 1\\), which would be \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). So, would the coefficient be 6 * 64 = 384? But that seems too large. Wait, no, that's not correct because the coefficients in the \\(c\\) expansion are not all 1. Let me think again. Alternatively, maybe the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the \\(c\\) expansion. But that's not correct because each term in the \\(c\\) expansion has different powers of \\(c\\), so when you multiply, the coefficients for each term involving \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times each coefficient in the \\(c\\) expansion. But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, it's actually the sum of all the coefficients from the \\(c\\) expansion multiplied by 6. But that would mean the coefficient is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The sum of the coefficients in a polynomial is found by setting all variables to 1. So, setting \\(c = 1\\), we get \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient would be 6 * 64 = 384. But wait, that seems high. Let me check again. Alternatively, maybe the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients from the \\(c\\) expansion because each term in the \\(c\\) expansion is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), so the total coefficient is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the \\(c\\) expansion.

Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think differently. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from \\((a + b)^4\\), and its coefficient is 6.

But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), it's actually 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the \\(c\\) expansion. Because when you multiply, each term in the \\(c\\) expansion will be multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), so the total coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) across all terms involving \\(c\\) would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the \\(c\\) expansion. Therefore, the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\(2^6 = 64\\). So, the coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384.

But that would mean the coefficient is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the \\(c\\) expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the \\(c\\) expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it, and the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and the rest is separate.

Wait, perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, meaning that we need to consider all terms, but since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just 6, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. But that can't be right because the entire expression is a product, so the coefficients would multiply. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, meaning that we have to consider the product, so the coefficient is 6 times the sum of the coefficients from the \\(c\\) expansion. So, 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is more straightforward. Let me think again. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). When you expand this, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\).

Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the \\(c\\) expansion. As I calculated earlier, the sum of coefficients in the \\(c\\) expansion is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. Therefore, the coefficient is 384.\n\nWait, but let me check if that makes sense. If I have \\((a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6. Then, when I multiply this by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) expansion is multiplied by each term in the \\(c\\) expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in the \\(c\\) expansion, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the \\(c\\) expansion. Since the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 64, the total coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384.

When multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the sum of the coefficients in the \\(c\\) expansion is 64.

So, maybe I'm missing something here. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is written in a way that both \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are being multiplied by terms involving \\(c\\), but that's not the case. Wait, looking back at the problem: it's \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, when you expand this, you get a product of two expansions. Each term in the first expansion is a term in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and each term in the second expansion is a term in \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, when you multiply them together, each term in the product will be of the form \\(a^kb^{4 - k} \\times c^m c^{-(6 - m)}\\), which simplifies to \\(a^kb^{4 - k} c^{2m - 6}\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, we need to find all the terms where \\(k = 2\\) because that gives \\(a^2b^2\\).

So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients from the second expansion, because each term in the second expansion would multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. But that would mean the coefficient is 6 times \\(2^6 = 64\\), because \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) has a sum of coefficients equal to \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). Wait, but that would mean the coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384. But that doesn't seem right because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not the sum of coefficients. Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it, and the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which would be 6 times the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, which doesn't make sense.

That would make more sense because then the coefficient would be a constant. Let me assume that's the case. So, to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, first, from \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, as we found earlier. Now, from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), we need the coefficient of \\(c^0\\), because we want the overall exponent of \\(c\\) to be zero. So, let's find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(1/c\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be zero, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which gives \\(m = 3\\). So, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part is 20. Now, since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product, we multiply the coefficients from each part: 6 (from \\(a^2b^2\\)) times 20 (from \\(c^0\\)), which equals 120. So, the coefficient is 120. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake. So, the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), gives \\(a^2b^2\\) with coefficient 6. The second part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), gives \\(c^0\\) with coefficient 20. Multiplying them gives 6 * 20 = 120. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is 120. Therefore, the answer should be 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then finding the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20. Multiplying these gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\boxed{120}"

So, perhaps the coefficient is just 6 times the coefficient of the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because when you multiply by a constant, it just scales the coefficient. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think again. Wait, no, actually, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product. But \\(a^2b^2\\) is only from the first part, and the second part is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), so when you multiply, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second part. But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), maybe I don't need to consider the \\(c\\) terms because \\(a^2b^2\\) is independent of \\(c\\). Wait, but no, that's not quite right. Because when you multiply two expressions, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, if I have \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part, and I multiply it by each term in the second part, which is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), then \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in that expansion. But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term in the product, it would actually be \\(a^2b^2\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, in other words, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that doesn't make sense because then it would be a polynomial in \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\). But perhaps the question is only considering the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. Alternatively, maybe the problem is considering \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) as separate variables, and it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). Hmm, that might be the case. So, in that case, when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by every term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would mean that the coefficient is \\(6 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that can't be right because the coefficient should be a number, not a polynomial. Hmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of the term \\(a^2b^2\\) times any power of \\(c\\), i.e., the coefficient in front of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for any \\(k\\). But that would mean the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 times \\(2^6 = 64\\), so 384. But that seems too high. Alternatively, maybe the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, so it's just 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which would be a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the question is phrased as \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", which suggests that perhaps it's considering the entire product as a polynomial in \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\), and it's asking for the coefficient of the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present, regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Wait, but the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), so it's \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient would be 6 * 64 = 384. Hmm, but I'm not sure if that's the correct interpretation. Alternatively, maybe the problem is considering \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) as separate variables, and it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where \\(c\\) is to the zero power, so the constant term. In that case, I would need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and multiply it by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, let's calculate that. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, as we found earlier. Now, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) can be found using the binomial theorem. The general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(1/c\\right)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We want the exponent of \\(c\\) to be zero, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which implies \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product is 6 * 20 = 120. Hmm, that seems more reasonable. So, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. Alternatively, if it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), then it would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but that would be a polynomial, not a single coefficient. So, given the way the problem is phrased, I think it's more likely that it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. Let me double-check that. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product is 6 * 20 = 120. Yeah, that makes sense.

Wait, no, that's not right. Let me think again. Actually, when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each polynomial.

Wait, but that's not correct because the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) are not just coefficients but involve different powers of \\(c\\). So, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Maybe the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient.

But how do I find the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)? The sum of coefficients in a polynomial is found by substituting \\(c = 1\\). So, let me compute \\(\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = (2)^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 times 64, which is 384. Wait, but that seems too high. Let me check again. Alternatively, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\). That would make more sense because otherwise, the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\), which isn't typically what is asked. So, maybe I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by \\(c^0\\) in the product. That would require considering both expansions and finding the terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\). So, let me approach it that way. First, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, as I found earlier. Now, in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\), which is the constant term. Because when I multiply the two expansions, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second part, and I'm interested in the term where the power of \\(c\\) is zero, i.e., the constant term. So, first, I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). To find the constant term, I can use the binomial theorem again. The general term in the expansion is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\).

So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Now, since the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by the constant term 20 from the second part, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). So, the final answer should be 120. Wait, that seems more reasonable. Let me double-check. The expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) gives 6 as the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\). The expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) gives 20 as the coefficient for \\(c^0\\). Multiplying these together, 6 * 20 = 120. Yes, that makes sense.

So, if I have \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), then each term in the expansion would be of the form \\( \\dbinom{4}{k}a^{4 - k}b^k \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - m}\\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m \\).

So, the general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). The constant term is when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\). So, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Now, going back to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, as I calculated earlier. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 multiplied by 20, which is 120. Wait, but let me double-check. Is the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) indeed 20? Let me compute \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\) which is \\(\\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\), yes that's correct. So, 6 times 20 is 120. So, the coefficient is 120. Alternatively, maybe I can think of it as the entire expression being the product of two expansions, and since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are independent of \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be the product of the coefficients of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, that's 6 times 20, which is 120. So, I think that's the answer.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Multiplying these gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\boxed{120}"

    "text": " Because \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\). So, maybe I just need to find the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) and then see if there's any contribution from the other part. Wait, no, actually, when you multiply two expressions, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second. But since we're only interested in \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), that term would come from taking the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part and the constant term (i.e., the term with \\(c^0\\)) from the second part. Because if I take any other term from the second part, it would have a \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\) term, and then the product would have those \\(c\\) terms, but since we're only looking for \\(a^2b^2\\), the \\(c\\) terms must cancel out. So, in other words, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I already found that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. Now, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me think about how to expand that. Again, using the binomial theorem, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying that, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m} = \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the exponent on \\(c\\) is \\(6 - 2m\\). We need the exponent to be 0, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), \\(2m = 6\\) so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Let me compute that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Therefore, the overall coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 * 20 = 120. Wait, does that make sense? Let me double-check. So, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, and in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Since these two terms are multiplied together, the overall coefficient is indeed 6 * 20 = 120. So, I think that's the answer. But let me just make sure I didn't make a mistake in the binomial coefficients. For \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\), it's 6, that's correct. For \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\), it's 20, that's also correct. So, 6 * 20 is 120. Yeah, that seems right. I don't think I made any mistakes here.

    "text": " Or do I? Hmm, maybe not, because the question is only about the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. Wait, but actually, when you multiply two expressions, every term in the first expression gets multiplied by every term in the second expression.

But wait, the second expression is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which only involves \\(c\\). So, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second part. But since the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and the second expression doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product will just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, no, that doesn't make sense. Because when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second, but the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum of the products of coefficients from each polynomial whose variables multiply to give that term. But in this case, the second polynomial only has \\(c\\) terms, so when I multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by any term from the second polynomial, the resulting term will be \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some \\(k\\), right? So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, is that correct? Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by the entire expansion of the second expression, you're effectively scaling \\(a^2b^2\\) by the sum of all the coefficients in the second expression. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 (from the first part) multiplied by the sum of the coefficients of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, the sum of the coefficients of a polynomial is found by setting all variables to 1. So, if I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = (2)^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of the coefficients in the second expression is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 * 64 = 384. Hmm, that seems right, but let me double-check. Alternatively, maybe I can think of it differently. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all coefficients in the second part because the second part doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. So, yeah, that makes sense. So, 6 * 64 = 384. So, the coefficient is 384. Wait, but let me confirm by another method. Alternatively, maybe I can expand both expressions separately and see. So, \\((a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6. Now, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) can be expanded using the binomial theorem as well. So, \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). The sum of the coefficients would be when \\(c = 1\\), so each term becomes \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}\\), and the sum is \\(2^6 = 64\\). So, when I multiply the two expressions, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 * 64 = 384. So, that's consistent. Therefore, I think the answer is 384. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't miss anything. The problem is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when I multiply these, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part is multiplied by every term in the second part.

Wait, no, actually, no. Because when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficients multiply. Wait, no, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Wait, actually, no. Let me think again. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, when you expand this, each term from \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\).

Wait, but the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\). So, let me calculate that. When \\(c = 1\\), \\(\\left(1 + 1/1\\right)^6 = (2)^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of the coefficients is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 * 64 = 384. Wait, but let me check that again because I might be making a mistake here. Alternatively, maybe I should consider that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is just the coefficient from the first part, because the second part doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms.

So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would actually be the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the entire second part, which is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that can't be, because then the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\), not a constant. Wait, but the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not considering \\(c\\). Hmm, maybe I misread the problem. Let me check again. The problem says: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, which is a product of two polynomials. So, when you multiply the two polynomials, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will be present in the first polynomial, and it will be multiplied by every term in the second polynomial. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Because each term in the second part is a term in \\(c\\), so when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), it becomes \\(a^2b^2\\) times a term in \\(c\\), but the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so perhaps it's considering all the terms that result in \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. Wait, but that doesn't make sense because the \\(c\\) terms would create different terms. Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think differently. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). When you expand this, each term in the expansion will be of the form \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}a^{4 - k}b^k \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - m}(1/c)^m\\). So, each term is \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}\\dbinom{6}{m}a^{4 - k}b^k c^{6 - 2m}\\). Now, we are looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, we need \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). So, \\(k = 2\\), which gives us \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Now, for each such term, we also have the term from the second part, which is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, when we multiply, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each of these terms, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product will be 6 times the sum of all \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\) for all possible \\(m\\). Wait, but that would be 6 times \\(2^6\\), since the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is \\(2^6 = 64\\). So, 6 * 64 = 384. But wait, that can't be right because the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), so the \\(c\\) terms would be separate. Wait, no, actually, when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second part, you get terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would actually be the sum of all the coefficients from the second part, because each term from the second part is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just the coefficient from the first part times the sum of the coefficients from the second part. Wait, but that would mean the coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384. But let me verify this because I might be making a mistake. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to be interpreted as finding the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some \\(k\\), but the problem doesn't specify \\(c\\), so maybe it's just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. But in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the entire second expression, which is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for a coefficient, which should be a constant, not a polynomial. So, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Alternatively, maybe the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, treating \\(c\\) as a variable, so the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\). But that seems unlikely because the problem is phrased as \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", which suggests a constant coefficient, not a polynomial. So, perhaps I'm overcomplicating, and the problem is intended to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, considering that the second part is a separate polynomial, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be 6 times the entire second expression. But that doesn't make sense because the coefficient should be a number, not a polynomial. So, perhaps the problem is intended to be interpreted differently. Maybe the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, so the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\). But then, the problem is phrased as \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", which would be 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that seems odd because usually, when you're asked for a coefficient, it's a constant. So, perhaps the problem is intended to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, considering that the second part is independent, so the coefficient is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second part, which is 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, perhaps I should think of it as the product of the two expressions, and when you multiply, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term is just 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), so the coefficient is 6\\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would make the coefficient a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't seem right. Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me try to think differently. The problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. So, in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first part, and when you multiply by the second part, each term in the second part is a term in \\(c\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second part, you get \\(a^2b^2\\) times a term in \\(c\\), but the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second part. So, the sum of the coefficients in the second part is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 384. Wait, but let me check this with an example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). And \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) expands to a sum of terms with various powers of \\(c\\). When I multiply these two, each term from the first is multiplied by each term from the second. So, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part, which has coefficients like 1, 6, 15, etc., but when considering the entire product, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which is 64, giving 384. So, yes, I think that's correct. Therefore, the coefficient is 384.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. Another way to think about it is that when you have two polynomials multiplied together, the coefficient of a specific term in one polynomial is multiplied by the entire other polynomial. So, in this case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial is 6, and when you multiply by the second polynomial, each term in the second polynomial is multiplied by 6, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the entire second polynomial. But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, not a constant. But the problem is asking for the coefficient, which should be a constant. So, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Alternatively, maybe the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating \\(c\\) as a variable, so the coefficient would be 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that seems odd because usually, coefficients are constants. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which would be 6 times the entire second polynomial, so the coefficient is \\(6 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't seem right because the coefficient should be a constant. Alternatively, maybe the problem is intended to have us consider only the terms where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out, making a constant term, so that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\) would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Wait, that might make sense. Because if we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), but perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, considering all possible \\(c\\) terms, which would be 6 times the entire second polynomial. But that seems too broad. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be the term where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out. So, let me try that approach. So, in the second part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0 would be when the number of \\(c\\) terms equals the number of \\(1/c\\) terms. So, each term in the expansion is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - m}(1/c)^m = \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the exponent is \\(6 - 2m\\). We want this to be 0, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which gives \\(m = 3\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire product would be 6 * 20 = 120. So, perhaps that's the intended answer. Wait, but the problem didn't specify anything about \\(c\\), just \\(a^2b^2\\). So, maybe the problem is intended to have us consider the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the entire second polynomial, which is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But that seems odd because the problem is asking for a coefficient, which is typically a constant. So, perhaps the problem is intended to have us find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating \\(c\\) as a variable, so the coefficient is 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would make the coefficient a polynomial, which doesn't seem right. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, considering that the second part is a separate polynomial, so the coefficient is just 6 times the entire second part. But that doesn't make sense because the coefficient should be a constant. So, I'm confused now. Let me try to think again. The problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, when you multiply these two expressions, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\) with coefficient 6, and it's multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), because each term in the second part has a coefficient that gets multiplied by 6. The sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 * 64 = 384. Therefore, the answer is 384.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought maybe the problem wants the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be 120. But since the problem didn't specify anything about \\(c\\), I think the correct approach is to consider that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second part, which is 64, giving 384. So, I think 384 is the correct answer.\n\nBut let me check again. If I set \\(c = 1\\), the entire expression becomes \\((a + b)^4 \\times (2)^6 = (a + b)^4 \\times 64\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in this would be 6 * 64 = 384. So, that makes sense. Therefore, the coefficient is 384.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{384}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem.\n\nFirst, consider the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n\\]\nWe need the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2, which corresponds to \\(k = 2\\). The coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) is:\n\\[\n\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\n\\]\n\nNext, consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).

So, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the terms involving \\(c\\) will just tag along, but for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), it's just the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, no, that doesn't make sense. Because when you multiply two expressions, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) don't appear in the second expression, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product will just be the coefficient from the first part times the entire expansion of the second part. Wait, no, that's not quite right. Let me think again. Actually, when you have a product of two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each polynomial. But in this case, \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are only in the first part, so when you multiply, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first part will be multiplied by every term in the second part. But since we're just looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) don't appear in the second part, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product will just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the sum of all the coefficients in the second part. Wait, that doesn't seem right either. Let me clarify. Let me denote the first part as \\(P = (a + b)^4\\) and the second part as \\(Q = \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the product is \\(P \\times Q\\). The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\(P\\), specifically from the term \\(6a^2b^2\\). When I multiply this by \\(Q\\), each term in \\(Q\\) will be multiplied by \\(6a^2b^2\\), so the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be \\(6\\) times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(Q\\). Wait, no, that's not correct because each term in \\(Q\\) is a separate term, but we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\). So, actually, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be \\(6\\) times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(Q\\), because each term in \\(Q\\) is being multiplied by \\(6a^2b^2\\), and when you sum them all up, the coefficients add up. Wait, no, that's not quite right. Let me think again. The product \\(P \\times Q\\) will have terms like \\(a^2b^2 \\times c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2 \\times c^{-k}\\) for various \\(k\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, in other words, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is \\(6\\) times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(Q\\), because each term in \\(Q\\) contributes a coefficient that gets multiplied by \\(6a^2b^2\\), and when you sum all those terms, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) will be \\(6\\) times the sum of the coefficients in \\(Q\\). So, to find this, I need to compute the sum of the coefficients in \\(Q\\). How do I find the sum of the coefficients in a polynomial? Well, the sum of the coefficients is found by plugging in \\(c = 1\\) into \\(Q\\). Because when \\(c = 1\\), each term becomes just its coefficient, so the entire expression becomes the sum of the coefficients. So, let's compute \\(Q\\) at \\(c = 1\\): \\(\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = (1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the sum of the coefficients in \\(Q\\) is 64. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\(P \\times Q\\) is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). Wait, but let me check that again. Is that correct? Because each term in \\(Q\\) is multiplied by \\(6a^2b^2\\), so the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will indeed be \\(6\\) times the sum of the coefficients in \\(Q\\). So, yes, that seems correct. Alternatively, another way to think about it is that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(P\\) is 6, and since \\(Q\\) is multiplied by that term, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) across all terms in the product is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in \\(Q\\), which is 6*64=384. Therefore, the coefficient is 384. Hmm, but let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Let me go through it again. First, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Then, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) when expanded has terms with various coefficients. The sum of these coefficients is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\(2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, when we multiply \\(6a^2b^2\\) by each term in \\(Q\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). Yes, that seems right. So, the coefficient is 384.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break it down as follows:\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term with \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\):\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\n   \\]\n   So, the coefficient is 6.\n\n2. **Consider \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   The sum of the coefficients in this expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\):\n   \\[\n   \\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\n   \\]\n\n3. **Combine the results:**\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of the coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 64 = 384\n   \\]\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\\[\n\\boxed{384}\n\\]"

So, when we multiply them together, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which comes from \\((a + b)^4\\), and the problem doesn't mention any variables \\(c\\), so maybe the other part doesn't affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, that doesn't make sense. Because when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficients of the terms in one polynomial can affect the coefficients in the other. Wait, no, that's not quite right. Let me clarify. If I have two polynomials, say \\(P(a, b)\\) and \\(Q(c)\\), then when I multiply them, each term in \\(P\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(Q\\). So, for the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(P(a, b)\\), which is 6\\(a^2b^2\\), when multiplied by each term in \\(Q(c)\\), it will create terms like 6\\(a^2b^2c^k\\) and 6\\(a^2b^2 \\cdot c^{-m}\\), depending on the exponents in \\(Q(c)\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. Wait, but that's not possible because \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term without \\(c\\), so when you multiply \\(6a^2b^2\\) by terms in \\(Q(c)\\), you'd get terms like \\(6a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(6a^2b^2c^{-m}\\), but none of these would be just \\(a^2b^2\\) unless you have a term in \\(Q(c)\\) that is 1, i.e., \\(c^0\\). So, perhaps the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because when you multiply \\(6a^2b^2\\) by the constant term (the term with \\(c^0\\)) in \\(Q(c)\\), you get \\(6a^2b^2\\). If you multiply it by any other term in \\(Q(c)\\), you'll end up with terms that have \\(c\\) in them, which we don't want. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 times the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Therefore, I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me compute that. Again, using the binomial theorem, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying each term, that's \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m} = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is when \\(m = 3\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the constant term in the second part), which is 6 * 20 = 120. Wait, that seems correct, but let me double-check. Alternatively, maybe I can think of the entire expression as \\((a + b)^4\\) times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), and since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is independent of \\(c\\), it's the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part.

But since I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I can ignore the terms involving \\(c\\) because they won't affect the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. Wait, actually, no. Because when you multiply two polynomials, each term from the first polynomial is multiplied by each term from the second. But in this case, the second polynomial \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) doesn't have any \\(a\\) or \\(b\\) terms. So, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in \\((a + b)^4\\) will just be multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, no, that's not quite right. Because each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is a term with \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is a term with \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\).

But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, in the product, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will come from the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). However, since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), each multiplication by a term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) will just add a coefficient multiplied by that term. Wait, but that's not correct because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. Wait, no, actually, in the entire product, each term will be a combination of \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\), and \\(1/c\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2c^{-k}\\). But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would imply that the \\(c\\) terms are not considered, or perhaps that the coefficient is summed over all possible \\(c\\) terms. Wait, but that doesn't make sense. Let me re-read the problem: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, actually, the expression is a product of two polynomials: one in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the other in \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, when you multiply them, the variables are separate. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but since the question is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, it's actually the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire sum of coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, that can't be right because then the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which in the product would be multiplied by all the terms from the \\(c\\) expansion. So, perhaps the coefficient is 6 times the sum of the coefficients of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that seems too large. Alternatively, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Let me think again. When you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum of the products of the coefficients of terms that multiply together to give that specific term. In this case, since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are in one polynomial and \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) are in the other, the terms \\(a^2b^2\\) and \\(c^k\\) or \\(c^{-k}\\) don't interfere with each other. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the \\(c\\) expansion, each of those will contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. So, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Now, to find the sum of the coefficients of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), I can substitute \\(c = 1\\), because that will make each term equal to its coefficient. So, substituting \\(c = 1\\), we get \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the sum of the coefficients is 64. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 * 64 = 384. Wait, but that seems high. Let me check my reasoning again. Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, maybe the \\(c\\) part doesn't affect the coefficient, so the coefficient is just 6, and the \\(c\\) terms are separate. But that doesn't seem right because the entire expression is a product, so the coefficients would multiply. Wait, no, because \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are in one part, and \\(c\\) is in the other. So, when you multiply, each term in the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first part, and it's multiplied by each term in the second part, which are terms involving \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would actually be the coefficient from the first part times the entire second polynomial. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, perhaps the coefficient is 6 times the entire second polynomial. But that can't be, because the second polynomial is in terms of \\(c\\), and the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not considering \\(c\\). Wait, maybe the question is miswritten, or perhaps I'm misinterpreting it. Let me re-express the problem: We have \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). We need the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are in one part, and \\(c\\) is in the other, the variables are separate. So, when you multiply them, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by every term from the \\(c\\) expansion. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient from the first part times the sum of the coefficients from the second part. Because each term in the second part contributes its coefficient when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). So, as I thought earlier, the sum of the coefficients in the second part is 64, so the coefficient would be 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, meaning that the \\(c\\) terms are considered as part of the expression, but the coefficient is still just 6. But that doesn't make sense because the entire expression is a product, so the coefficient would be multiplied by the entire second polynomial. Hmm, I'm confused. Let me try another approach. Let's consider the entire product: \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When expanded, each term will be of the form \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}a^{4 - k}b^k \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - m}\\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\dbinom{4}{k}\\dbinom{6}{m}a^{4 - k}b^k c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). So, for \\(a^2b^2\\), \\(k = 2\\), and the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Now, for each \\(m\\) from 0 to 6, the term will be multiplied by \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the sum over all \\(m\\) of \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\dbinom{6}{m}\\). So, that would be 6 times the sum of \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\) for \\(m = 0\\) to \\(6\\). The sum of \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\) from \\(m = 0\\) to \\(6\\) is \\(2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 384. Wait, but I'm not sure if that's correct because the problem might be asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, but in reality, each term in the product will have both \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) and \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually be the sum of all the coefficients from the \\(c\\) terms multiplied by 6. So, yes, 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out. But the problem doesn't specify that. It just says the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, perhaps the answer is 384. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it, and the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and the second part doesn't affect it because \\(c\\) is a separate variable. But that doesn't seem right because the entire expression is a product, so the coefficients would multiply. Wait, no, because the variables are separate. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the entire second polynomial. But that's not possible because the second polynomial is in terms of \\(c\\). So, perhaps the answer is 6, and the \\(c\\) part is irrelevant. But that seems incorrect because when you multiply two polynomials, each term in one is multiplied by each term in the other, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients of the second polynomial.

So, maybe I just need to consider the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) and then multiply it by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but since we're only interested in the \\(a^2b^2\\) term, which comes from \\((a + b)^4\\), and the other part doesn't affect it, perhaps the coefficient remains 6 regardless of the other terms. Wait, but that doesn't seem right because when you multiply two expressions, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which comes from the first part, and the second part is multiplied by it, but since we're only looking for \\(a^2b^2\\), the other terms in the second expansion don't affect the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would just be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, that would mean the coefficient is 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Perhaps the problem wants the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, so the coefficient would just be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't make sense because the coefficient should be a number, not an expression in \\(c\\). Hmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, it's the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating \\(c\\) as another variable. But since \\(c\\) is separate from \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), so its coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. Wait, maybe I'm supposed to consider that the problem is looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, which would include all possible terms from both parts. But no, because \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), so the coefficient would just be 6 times the sum of all terms in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that's not possible because the sum of all terms in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is just the expansion, which isn't a number. Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Perhaps the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which would be 6 times the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that seems odd. Alternatively, maybe the problem is considering the entire product, and the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times whatever term is present in the second expansion. But that doesn't make sense because the second expansion is in terms of \\(c\\), which is separate. So, perhaps the coefficient is just 6, and the rest of the terms don't affect it because they involve \\(c\\). But that seems too simplistic. Alternatively, maybe the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, considering that the entire expression is a product of two polynomials, one in \\(a, b\\) and one in \\(c, 1/c\\). So, when you multiply them, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would come from the product of the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first polynomial and any term in the second polynomial. But since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is independent of \\(c\\), the coefficient would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Wait, no, that's not quite right. Because when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum of the products of the coefficients of terms whose variables multiply to give that term. But in this case, \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), so the coefficient would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that can't be because the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is a sum of terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), so when you multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), you'd get terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for various \\(k\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would just be the coefficient from the first part, 6, multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. So, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\), which is the constant term in the second expansion. That would make sense because then the coefficient would be a number. So, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which would involve multiplying the coefficient from the first part by the coefficient of the constant term in the second part. Let me check that. So, if that's the case, then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me calculate that. So, first, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, as I found earlier. Now, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me expand that using the binomial theorem. So, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which implies \\(k = 3\\). So, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). So, the final answer should be 120. Wait, let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is indeed 6. The coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 20. Multiplying them gives 120. That seems correct.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplying it by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20. Therefore, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\boxed{120}"

So, does that mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just 6 times whatever the coefficient is in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)? Wait, no, that doesn't make sense because the \\(c\\) terms would affect the overall expression when multiplied. But the question is only about the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, maybe I can ignore the \\(c\\) part because it doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\).

But that can't be, because that would make the coefficient a very large number. Wait, no, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Let me think again. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product of the two expressions. So, in other words, when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), you get a big expression where each term is a product of a term from the first expansion and a term from the second expansion. So, to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I need to look for all the terms in the product where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2 each. But since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are only in the first part, and \\(c\\) is only in the second part, the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) don't get affected by the second part. So, actually, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will only come from the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by every term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that would mean the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all the binomial coefficients in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Hmm, but that's not right because each term in the product would have both the \\(a^2b^2\\) and some \\(c\\) term. But the question is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. Wait, no, that can't be. Because in the product, each term would have both \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) parts and \\(c\\) parts. So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I have to consider all the terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any combination of \\(c\\) terms. So, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems too large. Wait, let me think differently. Maybe the question is only considering the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, but that doesn't make sense because \\(c\\) is part of the expression. Alternatively, perhaps the question is only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by some \\(c\\) terms, but since \\(c\\) and \\(a\\), \\(b\\) are separate variables, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).

But that seems odd because the coefficient would then be a polynomial in \\(c\\). Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), meaning the term where \\(c\\) cancels out. So, perhaps I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by \\(c^0\\) in the entire product. That makes more sense. So, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). So, I need to find the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\), which is 1.

How do I do that? Let's think. The expression \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) can be expanded using the binomial theorem. So, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0. So, set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Let me calculate that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire product is 6 * 20 = 120. So, the answer should be 120. Wait, let me double-check. So, \\((a + b)^4\\) gives 6 for \\(a^2b^2\\), and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) gives 20 for \\(c^0\\). Multiplying them together gives 6 * 20 = 120. That seems correct.

Because if you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by a term with \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), you'll get \\(a^2b^2c\\) or \\(a^2b^2/c\\), which are different terms. So, to get just \\(a^2b^2\\), you need to multiply it by the constant term in the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the constant term in the second part. So, I already found that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. Now, I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me expand that using the binomial theorem as well. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k\\).

So, if I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = (2)^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion is 64.

So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the entire second expansion, which would make the coefficient a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, so maybe I'm misunderstanding. Wait, perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 times 64, as I thought earlier, which is 384. But let me think again. Alternatively, maybe the problem is considering the entire expression, and the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term from the second expansion, so the coefficient would be 6 times each term in the second expansion, but since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), perhaps we're only interested in the constant term in the second expansion. So, let me compute the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem, the general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We want the exponent of \\(c\\) to be zero, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\). So, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 times 20, which is 120. Hmm, that makes more sense because then the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by the constant term, resulting in a term with \\(a^2b^2\\) and no \\(c\\). So, perhaps that's the correct approach. Let me double-check. So, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. In \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the constant term is 20. Therefore, when you multiply these two expansions, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by the constant term 20 from the second part, giving a total coefficient of 6 * 20 = 120. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120. I think that's the right answer.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Next, we find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which occurs when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. This happens at \\(k = 3\\), giving \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying these together gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\boxed{120}"

    "text": " Or do I? Wait, no, because the entire expression is the product of \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when I expand the whole thing, each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which comes from \\((a + b)^4\\), and the rest of the terms come from the other part. Wait, but the other part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), so when we multiply, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part will be multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, each term would contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by whatever comes from the second part. Wait, but no, that's not correct. Because when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum of the products of the coefficients of terms whose variables multiply to give that specific term. But in this case, since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are only in the first part, and \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) are only in the second part, the variables don't interfere with each other. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would only come from the first part, and any term in the second part, regardless of \\(c\\), would just multiply it. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that doesn't sound right because the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) would be when \\(c = 1\\), which is \\(2^6 = 64\\). So, then the coefficient would be 6 * 64 = 384. But that seems too large. Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again. Since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are only in the first part, and \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) are only in the second part, the variables are separate. So, when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), the only way that happens is if we take the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part and multiply it by the constant term from the second part. Wait, is that right? Because if we take any term from the second part that has a \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), then the resulting term would have \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2 \\cdot (1/c)^k\\), which would not be a pure \\(a^2b^2\\) term. So, the only way to get a term with just \\(a^2b^2\\) is to multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part by the constant term (i.e., the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero) from the second part. So, that means the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). That makes more sense. So, let me calculate that. First, as before, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Now, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). To do that, I can use the binomial theorem again. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, the exponent of \\(c\\) in each term is \\(6 - 2k\\). We want the exponent to be 0, so we set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Wait, but let me double-check that. So, the first part gives 6, the second part gives 20, so 6 times 20 is indeed 120. But just to make sure, maybe I can think of it another way. If I were to multiply out \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would come from the first part, and any term from the second part would have to not affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms, which means only the constant term in the second part. So, yes, that would be 6 times 20, which is 120.

Wait, no, that can't be right. Because the entire expression is a product, so the \\(a^2b^2\\) term is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is part of the product, the coefficient will actually be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the sum of all terms in the second part, because when you multiply, each term from the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part. Wait, that might not be correct either. Let me clarify. Let's denote the first part as \\((a + b)^4\\) and the second part as \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when we expand the product, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product. Wait, but in the product, \\(a^2b^2\\) is just one term, so when you multiply it by the entire second expansion, you get \\(a^2b^2\\) times the entire second expansion. So, in the product, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the sum of all coefficients in the second part, because each term in the second part is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 (from the first part) times the sum of the coefficients in the second part. But wait, the second part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The sum of the coefficients in this expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of the coefficients is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 times 64, which is 384. Wait, but let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think differently. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), and when you multiply it by the second part, which is a polynomial in \\(c\\), the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the entire second expansion evaluated at \\(c = 1\\), which is the sum of the coefficients. So, that would mean the coefficient is 6 times 64, which is 384. Alternatively, maybe I should think about it as the product of two independent expansions. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion because each term in the second expansion is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). So, yeah, that makes sense. Therefore, the coefficient is 6 times 64, which is 384. Wait, but let me check if I'm correct. Let me take a simpler example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, expanding, we get \\((a^2 + 2ab + b^2) \\times (c + 1/c)\\). The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in this product would be zero because in the first part, the highest power is \\(a^2\\) and \\(b^2\\), but when multiplied by the second part, which is degree 0 in \\(c\\), but in the product, the terms would be \\(a^2c\\), \\(a^2 \\times 1/c\\), etc. So, in this case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is zero because \\(a^2b^2\\) isn't present in the product. Wait, that's different from what I thought earlier. So, perhaps my approach is wrong. Wait, in this case, \\((a + b)^2\\) gives \\(a^2 + 2ab + b^2\\). When multiplied by \\((c + 1/c)\\), the product would have terms like \\(a^2c\\), \\(a^2 \\times 1/c\\), \\(2ab c\\), \\(2ab \\times 1/c\\), \\(b^2c\\), \\(b^2 \\times 1/c\\). So, in this product, there is no \\(a^2b^2\\) term because the first expansion only has \\(a^2\\), \\(ab\\), and \\(b^2\\), and the second expansion doesn't have any \\(a\\) or \\(b\\) terms. So, in this case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is zero. But according to my earlier approach, I would have taken the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is zero, times the sum of coefficients in the second part, which is 2, giving zero, which is correct. So, that seems to check out. But in my original problem, the first part does have an \\(a^2b^2\\) term, so the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of coefficients in the second part, which is 64, giving 384. So, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe I can think of it as the entire expression being a product, and the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just the coefficient from the first part times the entire second part, because when you multiply, each term in the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part, so the \\(a^2b^2\\) term is multiplied by every term in the second expansion, but since we're only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second part, which is 64, so 6 \u00d7 64 = 384. So, I think that's the correct answer. Wait, but let me make sure. Alternatively, perhaps I can consider that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is just the coefficient from the first part times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part, because \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term with no \\(c\\) component, so it's multiplied by the constant term in the second expansion. But wait, in the second expansion, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the constant term is the term where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out, which is when we have equal numbers of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, the general term in the expansion is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(1/c\\right)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We want the exponent of \\(c\\) to be zero, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\). So, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, times the constant term from the second part, which is 20, giving 6 \u00d7 20 = 120. Wait, that's different from what I thought earlier. So now I'm confused. Which approach is correct? Let me think carefully. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, which includes terms with \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, in the product, the term \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) and \\(a^2b^2 \\times 1/c^k\\) would exist for each \\(k\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. Wait, but that's not possible because in the product, \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by various powers of \\(c\\), so the term \\(a^2b^2\\) itself doesn't exist as a standalone term unless it's multiplied by \\(c^0\\), which is 1. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient from the first part times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part, because that's the only term that would give \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms. Therefore, the coefficient is 6 \u00d7 20 = 120. So, that contradicts my earlier conclusion of 384. So, which one is correct? Let me try to resolve this. The confusion arises from whether the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms or specifically looking for \\(a^2b^2\\) times any \\(c\\) terms. But the way the problem is phrased, it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would imply that it's looking for the coefficient of the term \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) part. But in reality, in the product, \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, so the term \\(a^2b^2\\) itself isn't present unless it's multiplied by \\(c^0\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient from the first part times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part. So, that would be 6 \u00d7 20 = 120. Alternatively, if the problem had asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some \\(k\\), then it would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^k\\) in the second expansion. But since it's just \\(a^2b^2\\), without any \\(c\\) terms, the coefficient is 6 times the constant term in the second expansion, which is 20, giving 120. Therefore, I think my initial approach was incorrect because I assumed that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by the entire sum of coefficients in the second expansion, but actually, it's only multiplied by the constant term in the second expansion. So, the correct coefficient is 120. Wait, but let me think again. If I set \\(c = 1\\), then the second expansion becomes \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\), and the product becomes \\((a + b)^4 \u00d7 64\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 \u00d7 64 = 384. But if I set \\(c = 1\\), I'm effectively considering the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which gives me the total when \\(c = 1\\). But in reality, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is only multiplied by the constant term in the second expansion, not the entire sum. So, perhaps setting \\(c = 1\\) isn't the right approach here. Let me clarify: when you have a product of two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each polynomial. So, in this case, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first polynomial, and to get the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, it must be multiplied by a term in the second polynomial that has no \\(c\\) terms, i.e., the constant term. Therefore, the coefficient is 6 \u00d7 20 = 120. So, that must be the correct answer. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is found by considering the expansion of each part separately and then multiplying the relevant coefficients.\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\)**:\n   Using the binomial theorem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n\n2. **Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)**:\n   The constant term (where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero) is found when \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), giving \\(k = 3\\).

But that seems complicated, and I don't think that's what the problem is asking for. Maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try another approach. Let's consider that when you multiply two expressions, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each expression. But in this case, since \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) are multiplied together, the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are independent of the terms involving \\(c\\).

But that can't be right because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, not an expression involving \\(c\\).

Wait, but the sum of all coefficients in a polynomial is found by setting all variables to 1. So, if I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = (1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 * 64 = 384. But wait, is that correct?

If I have two polynomials, \\(P(a, b)\\) and \\(Q(c)\\), then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\(P(a, b) * Q(c)\\) would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(P(a, b)\\) multiplied by the entire polynomial \\(Q(c)\\).

Alternatively, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then we need to consider the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). That would make more sense. So, let's compute that. First, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, as we found earlier. Now, we need the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). To find that, we can use the binomial theorem again. Let's expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem: \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(k = 3\\). So, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Now, multiplying the two coefficients together: 6 (from \\(a^2b^2\\)) times 20 (from \\(c^0\\)) gives 120. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product is 120. But wait, the original problem didn't specify anything about \\(c\\), it just asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, maybe I need to clarify: when the problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", does it mean regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, or does it mean the term \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by any combination of \\(c\\) terms? I think in the context of such problems, unless specified otherwise, they usually ask for the coefficient of a specific term, considering all variables. But in this case, since \\(a^2b^2\\) is separate from \\(c\\), perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), treating \\(c\\) as another variable, so the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems unlikely because the problem is probably expecting a numerical coefficient. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is miswritten, and it's supposed to be asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be 120. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, regardless of \\(c\\), which would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). As I calculated earlier, the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. But I'm not sure if that's what the problem is asking for. Let me think again. If I have two polynomials, say \\(P(a, b) = (a + b)^4\\) and \\(Q(c) = \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), then the product \\(P(a, b) * Q(c)\\) is a polynomial in \\(a, b, c\\). The term \\(a^2b^2\\) would appear multiplied by each term in \\(Q(c)\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the entire polynomial \\(Q(c)\\). But that would mean the coefficient is \\(6 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is not a numerical coefficient. So, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, which would mean that the coefficient is \\(6 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems odd because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, not an expression. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, considering only the terms where the exponents of \\(c\\) are zero, which would be the term where \\(c^0\\), which we found to be 20, so 6 * 20 = 120. That makes sense because that would give a numerical coefficient. So, perhaps that's what the problem is asking for. To confirm, let's think about it: when you have multiple variables, the coefficient of a specific term like \\(a^2b^2\\) would include all the terms from the other variables. But if you want the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the other variables, you have to consider all possible combinations, which would involve summing over the coefficients from the other polynomial. But that's not standard. Usually, when you ask for the coefficient of a term in a product of polynomials, you're looking for the coefficient of the specific combination of variables. So, in this case, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), it's 120. If it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), it's 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is not a numerical value. Therefore, I think the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and since \\(c\\) is another variable, it's 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that seems unlikely. Wait, but the problem is written as \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), so when you expand this, each term from \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by each term from the second part. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times each term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that's not a single coefficient; it's an entire expression. Therefore, perhaps the problem is miswritten, and it's supposed to be asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating \\(c\\) as a variable, so the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that's not a numerical answer. Since the problem is asking for a coefficient, I think the intended answer is 120, which is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). Therefore, I'll go with that.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break down the problem as follows:\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\), so its coefficient is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\n   \\]\n\n2. **Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n   \\]\n   We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, which occurs when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), so \\(m = 3\\).

    "text": " Or do I? Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me think. Since the problem is only about \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), perhaps the other terms involving \\(c\\) don't affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, maybe I can consider the coefficient separately from the rest. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, as I found. Now, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) gets multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and that term doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, no, that doesn't seem right. Let me clarify. When you multiply two expressions, each term in the first expression is multiplied by each term in the second expression. But since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the product would be the product of \\(a^2b^2\\) from \\((a + b)^4\\) and the constant term (if any) from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) doesn't have a constant term unless we consider the term where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out. So, perhaps I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), and then multiply that by 6, the coefficient from the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. Let me check that. So, first, find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We want the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, because that's the constant term. So, set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\) so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20. Therefore, when we multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the constant term from the other expansion, which is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Wait, but let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. So, when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficients multiply for the terms where the exponents add up appropriately. But in this case, since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term from the first polynomial and the constant term is from the second, their product would indeed be \\(a^2b^2 \\times \\text{constant}\\), so the coefficient would be 6 times 20, which is 120. Let me just double-check my steps. First, \\((a + b)^4\\) gives \\(a^2b^2\\) with coefficient 6. Then, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) has a constant term of 20. So, multiplying these together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 * 20 = 120. That seems correct. Alternatively, maybe I should think about it as the entire expansion, but since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), their coefficients are independent. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would indeed be the product of the coefficients from each part. So, I think 120 is the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break down the problem into two parts.\n\n1. **Expanding \\((a + b)^4\\):**\n   Using the binomial theorem, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\) in the expansion.

Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think again. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when you expand both, each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).

Wait, no, that doesn't make sense. Because when you multiply, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, but the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product. But since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) will just be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion, which is not possible because the coefficient should be a constant, not a polynomial. Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Let me clarify: the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in other words, in the entire product, I'm looking for all terms that have \\(a^2b^2\\), and then sum their coefficients. Since \\(a^2b^2\\) is only present in \\((a + b)^4\\) as a single term multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that doesn't sound right either because the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) would be when \\(c = 1\\), which is \\( (1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, would the coefficient be 6 * 64 = 384? Hmm, but that seems high. Alternatively, maybe I'm supposed to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), because otherwise, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by terms with different powers of \\(c\\), but the problem just says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", without specifying anything about \\(c\\). So, perhaps it's considering all possible powers of \\(c\\), and just wants the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\). But that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which would be a polynomial in \\(c\\), but the problem is asking for a coefficient, which is a number, not a polynomial. So, perhaps I need to interpret the problem differently. Maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\). That would make sense because otherwise, the coefficient would depend on \\(c\\). So, let me assume that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product. So, to find that, I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), and then multiply them together. So, as I found earlier, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. Now, let's find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Now, multiplying the two coefficients together: 6 (from \\(a^2b^2\\)) and 20 (from \\(c^0\\)), we get 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product is 120. But wait, the original problem didn't specify \\(c^0\\), it just asked for \\(a^2b^2\\). So, maybe I was overcomplicating it by considering \\(c\\). Let me go back. The problem is: What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, in the entire product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) can be multiplied by any term from the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. Therefore, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), as I initially thought. Alternatively, maybe the problem is considering only the \\(a^2b^2\\) term, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, but that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384, as I thought earlier. But that seems too large. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, meaning that the coefficient is 6, and the rest is multiplied by some expression in \\(c\\). But in that case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the entire expansion, which isn't a single number. So, perhaps the problem is miswritten, or perhaps I'm misinterpreting it. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The sum of coefficients in a polynomial is found by setting all variables to 1. So, in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), setting \\(c = 1\\), we get \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of coefficients is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 * 64 = 384. But I'm not sure if that's what the problem is asking. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, without considering the \\(c\\) terms, which would mean that the coefficient is 6, and the \\(c\\) terms are just multiplied along. But that doesn't seem right either because the problem is written as a product, so the \\(c\\) terms are part of the expansion. I'm a bit confused here. Let me try to think differently. Maybe the problem is written as \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), and we need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in other words, in the entire expansion, collect all terms that have \\(a^2b^2\\), and sum their coefficients, regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first part, and it is multiplied by every term in the second part. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for a coefficient, which is a number, so perhaps it's considering the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), which is 6 * 20 = 120, as I calculated earlier. Alternatively, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\), which would mean that it's 6 times the entire expansion, but that's a polynomial, not a number. So, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be 120. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, regardless of \\(c\\), which would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384. But I'm not sure which interpretation is correct. Let me check the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" It doesn't specify anything about \\(c\\), so perhaps it's considering all possible powers of \\(c\\), and just wants the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, which doesn't make sense. Therefore, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be 120. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, considering only the constant term in \\(c\\), which is 120. I think that's the most reasonable interpretation, because otherwise, the coefficient would be a polynomial, which doesn't make sense as an answer. So, I think the answer is 120. Wait, but let me make sure. Let's consider that when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), which would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384.

So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\( (a + b)^4 \\) is multiplied by each term in \\( \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 \\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\( (a + b)^4 \\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\( \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 \\). Wait, no, that's not right either. Wait, actually, each term in \\( (a + b)^4 \\) is a monomial in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and each term in \\( \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 \\) is a monomial in \\(c\\). So, when you multiply them, the terms are products of monomials in \\(a, b\\) and monomials in \\(c\\). Therefore, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by each term in \\( \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 \\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\( (a + b)^4 \\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\( \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 \\). Wait, but that doesn't seem right because each term in \\( \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 \\) has a coefficient, and when you multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), each of those coefficients would contribute to the overall coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for various \\(k\\). But the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\( (a + b)^4 \\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\( \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 \\). Wait, but that's not quite right either because each term in \\( \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 \\) is of the form \\(c^k\\) or \\(c^{-k}\\), so when you multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), you get terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) and \\(a^2b^2c^{-k}\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is actually the sum of the coefficients of all those terms. Wait, but that would mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is equal to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\( (a + b)^4 \\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\( \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 \\). Because each term in \\( \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 \\) contributes its coefficient when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the total coefficient would be 6 (from \\(a^2b^2\\)) times the sum of coefficients in \\( \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 \\). Wait, but how do I find the sum of coefficients in \\( \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 \\)? The sum of coefficients in a polynomial is found by setting all variables to 1. So, if I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\( \\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = (2)^6 = 64 \\). So, the sum of coefficients is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 * 64 = 384. Wait, but that seems a bit high. Let me check that again. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are independent variables, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would indeed be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\( (a + b)^4 \\) times the entire expansion of \\( \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 \\), but since \\(a^2b^2\\) is being multiplied by each term in the second expansion, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 multiplied by the sum of coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, giving 384. Alternatively, maybe I should think of it as the product of the two expansions, so each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the sum of all coefficients in the second part. So, yes, 6 * 64 = 384. Hmm, that seems correct. Let me see if there's another way to approach it. Alternatively, maybe I should consider that \\(a^2b^2\\) is only present in the first part, and the second part doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms, so the coefficient would just be 6 times the entire expansion of the second part. But since we're only asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, it's 6 times the sum of coefficients in the second part, which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. So, I think that's the answer. But let me double-check. Alternatively, maybe I can think of the entire product as \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), and when expanding, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is multiplied by every term in the second part. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the sum of all coefficients in the second part. As before, that's 6 * 64 = 384. Yeah, I think that's correct. So, the coefficient is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is found using the binomial coefficient \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). The entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) contributes a sum of coefficients equal to \\(2^6 = 64\\) when \\(c = 1\\). Multiplying these results gives \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n\\boxed{384}"

So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), it's just 6 times the sum of all terms in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But wait, that can't be right because that would mean the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion, which doesn't make sense because we're looking for a specific term. Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\), and when you multiply it by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in that expansion will multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would include all the terms from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) multiplied by 6. Wait, but that would mean the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that can't be right because the coefficient should be a number, not an expression. Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" Oh, wait, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion of the entire expression, treating \\(c\\) as a variable. So, that would mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would include all the terms from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) multiplied by 6. So, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't seem right either because the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) would be when \\(c = 1\\), which is \\(2^6 = 64\\). So, then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times 64, which is 384. But that seems too large. Wait, maybe I'm not considering that the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is only from \\((a + b)^4\\), and when multiplied by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\).

Maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, in other words, when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients of each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 times \\(2^6 = 64\\), so 384. But that seems too large, and I'm not sure if that's the correct approach.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm making a mistake here. Let me try another approach. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, as I found earlier. Now, when I multiply this by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But the sum of the coefficients in a polynomial is found by setting all variables to 1. So, if I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = (1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 64. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times 64, which is 384. But I'm not sure if that's correct because the problem might be asking for the coefficient in the entire product, considering all variables, but maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 times 64, giving 384. But I'm not entirely confident about this approach.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think again. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, when you multiply these two expressions, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from \\((a + b)^4\\) and is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't make sense because the coefficient should be a number, not an expression. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only considering the terms where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out, i.e., the constant term. Wait, that might make more sense. So, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Because if you're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms, you'd need to multiply by the constant term from the second expression. So, let's try that approach.\n\nFirst, find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, as before. Then, find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). To find the constant term, we can use the binomial theorem again. The general term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(1/c\\right)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be zero for the constant term, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times 20, which is 120. That seems more reasonable. So, the coefficient is 120.\n\nWait, but let me make sure. If I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and I'm multiplying by the constant term in the second expression, then yes, the coefficient would be 6 times 20, which is 120. Alternatively, if the problem is asking for the coefficient regardless of \\(c\\), then it would be 6 times the entire expansion, which would be 384, but that seems unlikely. The more plausible scenario is that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by the constant term in the second expression, resulting in 120. So, I think 120 is the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. To find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product with \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we need the constant term from the second expansion, which is 20. Multiplying these together gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\boxed{120}."

Wait, is that correct? Let me think. Actually, when you multiply two expressions, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression. So, if I'm looking for the term that has \\(a^2b^2\\), I need to consider that in the first part, the term is \\(6a^2b^2\\), and in the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), I need the term that doesn't involve \\(c\\) because \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't have any \\(c\\) terms.

So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would just be the coefficient from the first part, because the second part is a separate variable. Wait, but that seems off. Let me think differently. Maybe I need to consider that when you multiply the two expressions, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term is multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term in the product. Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Let me clarify: The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the product is a polynomial in variables \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\), and \\(1/c\\). The term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be part of this product. To find its coefficient, I need to consider how it arises. Since \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the \\((a + b)^4\\) part, and the other part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), doesn't affect \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is not just a number but a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient, which is usually a number. Hmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, perhaps it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). But in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial. But that doesn't make sense because the coefficient should be a number. Wait, maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\). That would make sense because then the coefficient would be a number. So, perhaps the problem is implicitly asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). Let me assume that. So, to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), I need to consider the product of the two expansions. So, the coefficient would be the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Because when you multiply two terms, the exponents add up. So, to get \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), you need \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part and \\(c^0\\) from the second part. So, that makes sense. Therefore, the coefficient would be 6 (from \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\)) multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, now I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Let me expand that using the binomial theorem. So, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(1/c\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0.

So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire product is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).

Then, expanding \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term with \\(c^0\\) is when \\(k = 3\\), which gives \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying these together, 6 * 20 = 120. That seems correct. Alternatively, if I think about the entire product, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term is 6a^2b^2, and it's multiplied by each term in the second expansion.

    "text": " Because \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\). So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would just be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, no, that's not quite right. Because when you multiply two polynomials, each term from the first polynomial gets multiplied by each term from the second. However, since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient would just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because the \\(c\\) terms don't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. Wait, but that doesn't make sense because the entire expression is the product of two expansions, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, no, that's not correct either. Because each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems like a lot. Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Maybe the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just 6, and the rest of the terms involving \\(c\\) don't affect it because they're separate variables. Wait, but that doesn't seem right. Let me think again. When you have two separate variables, \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and \\(c\\), their expansions are independent. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since we're just looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, no, that's not right. Because when you multiply, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term without \\(c\\), we need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and then multiply it by the sum of the coefficients of all terms in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in the other expansion. But wait, actually, no. Because the product is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which can be written as \\(\\sum_{k=0}^4 \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k \\times \\sum_{m=0}^6 \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). So, when you multiply these two sums together, each term will be \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k \\times \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). Now, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, in the first sum, we need \\(4 - k = 2\\), which means \\(k = 2\\). So, the coefficient from the first part is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Now, for the second sum, we have terms involving \\(c\\). But since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), that means we need to consider all the terms in the second sum, because each term in the first sum (which includes \\(a^2b^2\\)) is multiplied by each term in the second sum. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), because that makes each term equal to its coefficient. So, substituting \\(c = 1\\), we get \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times 64, which is 384. But wait, that seems high. Let me check my reasoning again. Alternatively, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, but considering all possible terms, including those with \\(c\\). But no, the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would indeed be 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, giving 384. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think differently. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\) with coefficient 6, and then it's multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 64, so 6 \u00d7 64 = 384. Therefore, the coefficient is 384. Wait, but let me double-check. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where the exponents of \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are 2, 2, and 0 respectively. But the problem just says \\(a^2b^2\\), so maybe it's considering all possible powers of \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, so 384. Alternatively, if the problem is only considering the term where \\(c\\) is raised to a specific power, but it doesn't specify, so I think it's safe to assume that it's considering all possible powers of \\(c\\), hence the coefficient is 384. Wait, but I'm a bit confused because sometimes when variables are separate, the coefficients don't combine that way. Let me think again. When you have two independent variables, \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and another variable \\(c\\), the coefficients for terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are independent of \\(c\\). So, in this case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\), the coefficient would indeed be 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, giving 384. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, so it's just 6. But that seems unlikely because the expression also includes \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which would affect the overall coefficient when multiplied. Wait, but no, because when you multiply two expressions, the coefficients of the terms in one don't affect the coefficients of the terms in the other unless they're multiplied together. So, in this case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 64, so 6 \u00d7 64 = 384. Therefore, the coefficient is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is found by first determining the coefficient in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplying it by the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 64. Thus, the final coefficient is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n\\boxed{384}"

But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), perhaps the terms involving \\(c\\) will just be coefficients themselves, and since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient would be the product of the coefficients from each part. Wait, but actually, the expression is \\((a + b)^4\\) times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when you multiply these, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), that would mean we need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero because \\(c^0 = 1\\), and that's the only way \\(a^2b^2\\) can appear without any \\(c\\) terms. So, first, let's find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which we found to be 6. Then, we need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because when we multiply 6 (from \\(a^2b^2\\)) by that coefficient, we'll get the overall coefficient for \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is just \\(a^2b^2\\). So, let's work on \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Again, using the binomial theorem, this expansion is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying that, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\times c^{-m}\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be zero, so we set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). So, the term where \\(m = 3\\) will have \\(c^0\\). The coefficient for that term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Now, since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we take the coefficient from each part and multiply them together. So, 6 (from \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part) multiplied by 20 (from \\(c^0\\) in the second part) gives 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120.\n\nWait, let me double-check to make sure I didn't make a mistake. So, the first part: \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Then, in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), we need the term where the exponents cancel out, so \\(c^{6 - 2m} = c^0\\), so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which gives \\(m = 3\\). The coefficient there is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying 6 and 20 gives 120. Yeah, that seems right.

Wait, is that right? Let me think. When you multiply two expressions together, each term in the first expression multiplies each term in the second expression. So, if I'm looking for a term that has \\(a^2b^2\\) and no \\(c\\) terms, then I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) because \\(c^0\\) is just 1, and multiplying by that won't affect the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. So, I need to find the term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0. Let me use the binomial theorem again for this. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\).

Wait, that seems confusing. Let me think again. When you multiply two expressions, the coefficients of the product are the products of the coefficients from each expression. So, if I have \\((a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k} c_k a^{4 - k}b^k\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m} d_m c^m\\), then the product will have terms \\(c_k d_m a^{4 - k}b^k c^m\\). But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, I need to find all the terms in the product where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2 each. That would correspond to \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\), so \\(k = 2\\), as I found earlier. So, the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and then this is multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that would mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, not an expression involving \\(c\\). Hmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" Wait, so it's possible that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in other words, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by any power of \\(c\\) would still count towards the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that also doesn't seem right because the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) would be when \\(c = 1\\), so \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). So, 6 times 64 is 384. But wait, is that correct? Because when you substitute \\(c = 1\\), you get the sum of the coefficients. But in this case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6*64=384. Hmm, but let me check that again. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), meaning that the term \\(a^2b^2\\) can be multiplied by any power of \\(c\\), so the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is indeed 6*64=384. But I'm not entirely sure. Let me think differently. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning that the power of \\(c\\) should be zero, so that the term is just \\(a^2b^2\\). In that case, I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). That would make sense too. So, first, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, as I found before. Then, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is the middle term when expanding, which would be \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, then the total coefficient would be 6*20=120. Hmm, but which interpretation is correct? The problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", without specifying anything about \\(c\\). So, in algebra, when you have multiple variables, the coefficient of a term like \\(a^2b^2\\) would include all possible coefficients from other variables, meaning that it's the sum over all possible exponents of other variables. So, in this case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6*64=384. But I'm a bit confused because sometimes in problems like this, they might mean the coefficient when all variables are set to specific powers, but in this case, it's not specified. Wait, let me think about how coefficients work in multivariate expressions. For example, in \\((a + b)(c + d)\\), the coefficient of \\(a\\) is \\(c + d\\), right? Because when you expand it, you get \\(ac + ad + bc + bd\\), so the coefficient of \\(a\\) is \\(c + d\\). Similarly, in this problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the sum over all coefficients that come from multiplying \\(a^2b^2\\) with any combination of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, that would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6*64=384. But wait, I think I might be overcomplicating it. Alternatively, maybe the problem is considering only the coefficient when the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out, meaning \\(c^0\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6*20=120. Hmm, I'm not sure which interpretation is correct. Let me try to think of an example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^2 (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, expanding, I get \\((a^2 + 2ab + b^2)(c + 1/c)\\). The coefficient of \\(a^2\\) would be \\(c + 1/c\\), right? So, in that case, it's the same as the entire expansion of the second part. Similarly, the coefficient of \\(ab\\) would be 2*(c + 1/c). So, applying that logic, in the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6*(sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\)), which is 6*64=384. So, I think that's the correct approach. Therefore, the coefficient is 384. But wait, let me confirm. Alternatively, maybe the problem is considering the term \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms, so the coefficient would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6*20=120. Hmm, I'm still unsure. Let me think again. The problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\". In algebra, the coefficient of a term is the factor that multiplies the variables. So, in this case, if the term is \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), the coefficient would include all possible coefficients from the \\(c\\) terms. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which would result in 6*(c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15/c^2 + 6/c^4 + 1/c^6). But that seems like a polynomial, not a numerical coefficient. Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the question. Perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where \\(a\\) is squared, \\(b\\) is squared, and \\(c\\) is to the zero power. In that case, the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 20, so 6*20=120. That seems more plausible because otherwise, the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make much sense in this context. So, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be 120. Let me check that again. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6a^2b^2. When multiplied by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is a coefficient times \\(c^k\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by each of these, resulting in terms like 6a^2b^2c^k. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(k\\) would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6*64=384. But if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it's 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 20, so 120. Hmm, I think the problem is more likely asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), because otherwise, the coefficient would be a polynomial, which doesn't make sense. So, I'll go with 120 as the answer. Therefore, the coefficient is 120.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. The problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\". So, in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) can be multiplied by any power of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the sum over all possible coefficients from the \\(c\\) terms. Therefore, it's 6 times the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). The sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient is 6*64=384. So, I think I was wrong earlier; the correct answer is 384. Because the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) includes all the terms where \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are squared, regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, each of those terms would have a coefficient that's 6 multiplied by the corresponding coefficient from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the total coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6*64=384. So, I think the correct answer is 384.\n\nWait, but now I'm getting confused again. Let me think of a simpler example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^1 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^1\\). Then, expanding, it's \\((a + b)(c + 1/c)\\). The coefficient of \\(a\\) is \\(c + 1/c\\), right? Similarly, the coefficient of \\(b\\) is also \\(c + 1/c\\). So, in this case, the coefficient of \\(a\\) is a polynomial in \\(c\\), not a numerical coefficient. But in the original problem, the question is about the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would similarly be a polynomial in \\(c\\). However, in the problem statement, it's not clear whether they want a numerical coefficient or a polynomial coefficient. But in most cases, when they ask for the coefficient of a term with multiple variables, they mean the numerical coefficient, assuming all other variables are set to 1. Wait, no, that's not correct. If they want the numerical coefficient, they would specify that they want the coefficient when all variables are set to 1, or they would ask for the constant term. But in this case, they just ask for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would include all coefficients from the other variables. So, in the example I just did, the coefficient of \\(a\\) is \\(c + 1/c\\), which is a polynomial. Therefore, in the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial. But the problem is asking for the coefficient, so perhaps they want the coefficient as a numerical value, but that doesn't make sense because the coefficient is a polynomial. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is miswritten, and they meant the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be a numerical value. So, given that, I think the intended answer is 120. Therefore, I'll go with 120 as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nWait, but I'm still not entirely sure. Let me try to think differently. If I consider the entire product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient is 6*(c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15/c^2 + 6/c^4 + 1/c^6). But this is a polynomial in \\(c\\), not a numerical coefficient. So, unless the problem is asking for the coefficient when \\(c = 1\\), which would make the entire expansion equal to 64, then the coefficient would be 6*64=384. But the problem doesn't specify anything about \\(c\\), so I think that's the correct approach. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 384.\n\nWait, but in the original problem, the variables are \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\). So, when they ask for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), they mean the sum of all coefficients that come with \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by any power of \\(c\\). Therefore, it's 6 multiplied by the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6*64=384. So, I think that's the correct answer.\n\nBut to make sure, let me consider the definition. The coefficient of a term in a product of polynomials is the sum of the products of the coefficients of terms whose variables multiply to give that term. So, in this case, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) can be obtained by taking the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from \\((a + b)^4\\) and multiplying it by any term from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient is indeed 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6*64=384.\n\nSo, after all that, I think the correct coefficient is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplying it by the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is calculated by setting \\(c = 1\\), resulting in \\(64\\). Therefore, the total coefficient is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n\\boxed{384}"

Wait, that doesn't make sense because when you multiply two expressions, each term from the first expression gets multiplied by each term from the second expression. But in this case, since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), maybe the coefficients are independent. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would just be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).

Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)\". Oh, wait, maybe the problem is considering all variables together, but \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), so the coefficient would just be 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that seems odd because the coefficient is a number, not a polynomial. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, which would include all the terms from the second expansion. Wait, but \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), so when you multiply by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the \\(a^2b^2\\) term would be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), etc. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would only consider the terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by 1 (i.e., the constant term in \\(c\\)). Because if you have \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by \\(c^k\\), that's a different term. So, to get the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), you need to find the term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) that has \\(c^0\\), which is the constant term. Then, the coefficient would be 6 times that constant term. So, first, let me find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (the constant term from the second part), which is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Wait, is that correct? Let me double-check. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 20. Since these are multiplied together, the overall coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\) is 6 * 20 = 120. So, the coefficient is 120. Alternatively, if the problem was considering the entire expression without separating variables, but I think that's not the case here because \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), so the coefficient would just be 6 times the constant term from the second expansion.

But wait, that doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a single coefficient, not a product of coefficients. Let me reconsider. Oh, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\), and when multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).

But that doesn't sound right because the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) isn't a constant; it's a sum of terms involving different powers of \\(c\\). Wait, but the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), without any restriction on the \\(c\\) terms. So, perhaps the coefficient is just 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. Hmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding the question. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, perhaps the problem is considering all the terms, and we're to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). That is, we're looking for the sum of all terms where the variables are \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by any combination of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, in other words, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that doesn't make sense because the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) would be found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which would give \\(2^6 = 64\\). But that would make the coefficient 6 * 64 = 384, which seems too high. Wait, maybe not. Let me think again. Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the product of the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in \\((a + b)^4\\) and each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean that the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which isn't a single number. So, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), that is, the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2 and 2, respectively, and the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0. That would make more sense because then we're looking for a specific term. Let me check the problem statement again: it says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\". It doesn't specify anything about \\(c\\), so perhaps it's just considering the coefficient in the entire expansion, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. But that would mean the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384, as I thought before. But I'm not sure if that's what the problem is asking. Alternatively, maybe the problem wants the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without considering the \\(c\\) terms, meaning that it's just 6, because the \\(c\\) part doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) coefficients. But that seems unlikely because the entire expression is a product, so the coefficients would be multiplied. Wait, no, because when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficients multiply only when the variables are the same. In this case, the variables are different: one part is in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the other is in \\(c\\). So, when you multiply them, the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from those involving \\(c\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, the coefficient would just be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But again, that doesn't make sense because the coefficient should be a number, not a polynomial. So, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think differently. Perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable, but just focusing on the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) parts. So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which would mean that the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), but the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, which suggests that perhaps the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by a specific power of \\(c\\), like \\(c^0\\), so that the entire term is \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), and then we're to find the coefficient of that. That would make sense. So, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), that is, the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\). So, in that case, I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). That seems more precise. So, let me proceed under that assumption. So, the term \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) would come from multiplying the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in \\((a + b)^4\\) by the \\(c^0\\) term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, first, I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which I already found to be 6. Then, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Once I have both coefficients, I can multiply them together to get the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product. So, let's find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Again, using the binomial theorem, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be 0, so we set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Now, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product is the product of the coefficients from each part, which is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) (assuming it's actually \\(a^2b^2c^0\\)) is 120. Wait, but the problem didn't specify \\(c^0\\), so maybe I'm overcomplicating again. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, meaning that the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which would be a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, so it's more likely that it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. So, I think that's the answer. Let me just recap: The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Multiplying these together gives 120. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is 120. Since the problem didn't specify the \\(c\\) part, but just asked for \\(a^2b^2\\), perhaps it's implied that we're considering the term where \\(c\\) is raised to the 0 power, so the answer is 120. Alternatively, if the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without considering \\(c\\), then it would be 6 times the entire expansion, but that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, which doesn't make sense. So, I think the correct interpretation is that we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. Therefore, the final answer is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by considering the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2 and the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0. \n\n1. Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n2. Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\), which occurs when \\(k = 3\\) in the binomial expansion, giving \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n3. Multiply these coefficients together: \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) (considering \\(c^0\\)) is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

So, to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), I can use the binomial theorem again.

So, actually, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but since we're only interested in the \\(a^2b^2\\) term, the \\(c\\) part doesn't affect it. Wait, is that correct? Let me think again. When I multiply two polynomials, each term in the first polynomial gets multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. But since we're only looking for terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) appears, and \\(c\\) is a separate variable, the \\(c\\) terms don't interact with \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but since we don't care about the \\(c\\) terms, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) is just 6 times whatever the constant term is in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, no, that's not right. Because when you multiply, each term from \\((a + b)^4\\) gets multiplied by every term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since we're only interested in the term \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, no, that's not correct either. Because when you multiply by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that can't be right because then the coefficient would be 6 times a large expression. Wait, no, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think again. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when you expand this, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, for the term \\(a^2b^2\\), which comes from \\((a + b)^4\\), it's multiplied by every term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 (from \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\)) multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that would mean I need to find the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The sum of all coefficients in a polynomial is found by plugging in \\(c = 1\\). So, if I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = (2)^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 (from the \\(a^2b^2\\) term) multiplied by 64, which is 6 * 64 = 384. Wait, that seems too straightforward. Let me check again. Alternatively, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Perhaps the question is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where \\(c\\) cancels out. Because otherwise, if it's just \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\), then it's 6 times 64, which is 384. But maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times any power of \\(c\\), but I don't think so because the way it's written, it's just \\(a^2b^2\\). So, I think my initial approach is correct. The coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me try another approach to confirm. Let's expand both parts separately and then see how they multiply.\n\nFirst, \\((a + b)^4\\): as before, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) has a coefficient of 6.\n\nNow, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let's expand this using the binomial theorem: \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\).\n\nSo, each term in this expansion is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\) for \\(k = 0\\) to \\(6\\).\n\nNow, when we multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, which includes various powers of \\(c\\). But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), we need to sum all the coefficients from the second expansion because each term in the second expansion will multiply \\(a^2b^2\\), and we want the total coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) across all possible \\(c\\) terms.\n\nWait, but that would mean the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. As I calculated earlier, the sum of coefficients in the second expansion is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem was asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where \\(c\\) is to the power of 0, then we would need to find the term in the second expansion where \\(c^0\\), which occurs when \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), so \\(k = 3\\). The coefficient there is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Then, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) would be 6 * 20 = 120. But the problem just says \\(a^2b^2\\), so I think it's 384.\n\nWait, but maybe I'm misinterpreting the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, it's just \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, that would mean that for each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), it contributes to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. So, the total coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem was asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), it would be 6 * 20 = 120. But since it's just \\(a^2b^2\\), it's 384.\n\nWait, but let me think again. When you have a product of two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum of the products of the coefficients of terms whose variables multiply to give the desired term. In this case, the desired term is \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\). So, in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by every term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) power. Therefore, the coefficient is indeed the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the sum of all coefficients in the second part. So, 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me check with a smaller example to make sure. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^1 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). The coefficient of \\(a^1b^0\\) is 1, and the sum of coefficients in \\((c + 1/c)^1\\) is \\(1 + 1 = 2\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^1b^0\\) in the product would be 1 * 2 = 2. Let's see: \\((a + b)(c + 1/c) = a c + a/c + b c + b/c\\). The terms with \\(a\\) are \\(a c\\) and \\(a/c\\), so the coefficient of \\(a\\) is indeed 2, which is 1 (from \\(a\\) in \\((a + b)\\)) times 2 (sum of coefficients in the second part). So, that seems to check out.\n\nSimilarly, if I take \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^2\\). The coefficient of \\(a^2b^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{2}{2} = 1\\). The sum of coefficients in \\((c + 1/c)^2\\) is \\( (1 + 1)^2 = 4\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^0\\) in the product would be 1 * 4 = 4. Let's expand it: \\((a^2 + 2ab + b^2)(c^2 + 2 + 1/c^2)\\). The terms with \\(a^2\\) are \\(a^2 c^2\\), \\(2 a^2\\), and \\(a^2 / c^2\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) is indeed 4, which is 1 * 4. So, that works.\n\nTherefore, in our original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me make sure that this approach is correct. Another way to think about it is that when you have two polynomials multiplied together, the coefficient of a term that doesn't involve the other variables is the product of the coefficients from each polynomial, but in this case, since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), it's like the coefficient is multiplied by the entire sum of the coefficients of the second polynomial, because each term in the second polynomial will multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term, and each of those contributes to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product.\n\nAlternatively, if I were to collect all the terms with \\(a^2b^2\\), they would be \\(a^2b^2 \\times c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2 \\times 6c^4\\), \\(a^2b^2 \\times 15c^2\\), \\(a^2b^2 \\times 20\\), \\(a^2b^2 \\times 15/c^2\\), \\(a^2b^2 \\times 6/c^4\\), \\(a^2b^2 \\times 1/c^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients from the second expansion, which is 6 * (1 + 6 + 15 + 20 + 15 + 6 + 1) = 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So, the coefficient is 384.\n\nWait, but let me confirm the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). The sum of coefficients is when \\(c = 1\\), so \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, that's correct.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nI think that's the correct answer. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning now.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplying it by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 64. Thus, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n\\boxed{384}"

    "text": " Or do I? Hmm, maybe I need to consider the entire expansion, but perhaps I can treat \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) as a single term when looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\).

So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I need to consider the term in \\((a + b)^4\\) that is \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).

But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term without \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), perhaps we need to consider the terms in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) that result in \\(c^0\\), meaning the constant term. Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by \\(c^0\\), you get \\(a^2b^2\\) times 1, which is just \\(a^2b^2\\). If you multiply it by \\(c^k\\) where \\(k \\neq 0\\), then you get terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2/c^k\\), which are different from \\(a^2b^2\\). So, to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). That makes sense because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by the constant term in the second expansion, you get the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. If you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by any other term, you'd get terms with \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), which aren't part of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, first, I already found that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. Now, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me use the binomial theorem again for this. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying each term, that becomes \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m} = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so we set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Now, going back to the original product, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the product of the coefficients we found from each expansion. So, that's 6 (from the \\(a^2b^2\\) term) multiplied by 20 (from the constant term in the \\(c\\) expansion). So, 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120.\n\nWait, let me double-check that. So, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Then, in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the constant term is when the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, which occurs when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), so \\(m = 3\\). The coefficient there is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying these together, 6 * 20 = 120. That seems correct.

But let me check this again. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which would be the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the entire second expansion, but since the second expansion has terms with different powers of \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the entire second expansion.

So, that would be 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think differently. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). When you expand this, each term will be of the form \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}a^{4 - k}b^k \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - m}(1/c)^m\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\(k = 2\\) in the first expansion, which gives \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}a^2b^2\\). Then, this is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, which is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) times the sum over all \\(m\\) of \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\). Because each term in the second expansion contributes a coefficient, and when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), it just adds that coefficient to the total coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the sum over all \\(m\\) of \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\) is equal to \\(2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384. So, I think that's the answer. But let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. Alternatively, maybe I should consider that the second expansion is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which can be written as \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - m} \\times (1/c)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, when I multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), each term in the second expansion contributes a coefficient \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\) multiplied by \\(c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the total coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) times the sum of \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\) for \\(m = 0\\) to \\(6\\). And since the sum of \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\) from \\(m = 0\\) to \\(6\\) is \\(2^6 = 64\\), the coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384. Yeah, that makes sense. So, I think the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 384.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product just the product of the coefficients of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and the sum of coefficients in the second part? Because when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a term in the product is the sum of the products of coefficients of terms whose variables multiply to give that term. In this case, since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are in one polynomial and \\(c\\) is in the other, the variables are separate. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be formed by multiplying \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first polynomial by any term from the second polynomial, regardless of the \\(c\\) part. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is indeed the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial. The sum of coefficients in the second polynomial is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), so \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384. So, I think that's correct. I don't see any mistakes in this reasoning.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{384}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem.\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\):\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\n   \\]\n   So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\n2. **Consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n   \\]\n   The sum of the coefficients in this expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\):\n   \\[\n   \\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\n   \\]\n\n3. **Combine the results:**\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is the product of the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) and the sum of the coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 64 = 384\n   \\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{384}\\)."

So, if I have \\((a + b)^4\\) and I multiply it by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will come from the product of the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in \\((a + b)^4\\) and the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), right? Because if I multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by something, it's just \\(a^2b^2\\) times that something. But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), that would be the coefficient from the first part times the entire expansion of the second part. Wait, no, that can't be right because the second part has terms with \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), which are variables as well. But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, maybe I can treat the second part as a constant when considering the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, that seems confusing. Alternatively, perhaps I should expand both parts separately and then find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. Let me try that. So, first, \\((a + b)^4\\) has the term \\(a^2b^2\\) with coefficient 6, as I found before. Then, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) can be expanded using the binomial theorem as well. Let's see: \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). Now, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, no, that's not quite right. Because each term in the product is \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\). So, if I substitute \\(c = 1\\), I get \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of all coefficients is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 * 64 = 384. Wait, but that seems too straightforward. Let me check that again. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in thinking that the coefficient is multiplied by the sum of all coefficients. Maybe it's more accurate to say that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is indeed 64. So, 6 * 64 = 384. Hmm, but let me think again. When you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each polynomial. But in this case, since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), the coefficient would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second polynomial, each term contributes a coefficient, and since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term without \\(c\\), the overall coefficient would be the product of 6 and the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial. So, yes, that makes sense. The sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is when \\(c = 1\\), which is \\(2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384. Wait, but let me make sure. Alternatively, perhaps the coefficient is just 6, because the second part is multiplied as a whole. But no, that doesn't seem right because the second part has multiple terms, so when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, each of those terms contributes to the coefficient. So, the total coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384.

Because when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion gets multiplied by each term in the second expansion.

Wait, but that would be the case if we were considering the product where each term is multiplied by all terms from the other expansion. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all terms in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that might not be the case. Alternatively, perhaps the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because otherwise, if we multiply by terms with \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), we would get terms like \\(a^2b^2c\\) or \\(a^2b^2/c\\), which are different from \\(a^2b^2\\). So, perhaps the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is to multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first expansion by the constant term from the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient would be 6 times the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, let me calculate the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). To find the constant term, I can use the binomial theorem again. The expansion is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k\\). Simplifying each term, that's \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} c^{-k} = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We want the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, because that's the constant term. So, set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 (from \\((a + b)^4\\)) multiplied by 20 (the constant term from the second expansion), which is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Wait, but let me double-check that logic. So, the idea is that in the product of two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in one polynomial is multiplied by the constant term (if any) in the other polynomial. So, if I have \\((a + b)^4\\) times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), then any term in \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), we need to find all the terms in the second expansion that, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), result in \\(a^2b^2\\). That would only happen if the term from the second expansion is a constant term (i.e., \\(c^0\\)), because otherwise, we'd have an extra factor of \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\). So, the only contribution to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 20. Therefore, the coefficient is indeed 6 times 20, which is 120. Let me see if there's another way to approach this. Alternatively, perhaps I can consider the entire expansion and see if there's any other term that could contribute. For example, suppose I have \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by \\(c^k\\) and \\(c^{-k}\\), but since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the only way for the product to have \\(a^2b^2\\) is if the \\(c\\) terms cancel out, meaning \\(k = 0\\). So, again, the only contribution is from the constant term in the second expansion. So, I think my initial conclusion is correct.
