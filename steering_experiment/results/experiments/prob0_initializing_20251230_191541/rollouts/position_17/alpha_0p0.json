    "text": " Because \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\). So, when I multiply the two expansions together, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part will be multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and the second part doesn't affect the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), the coefficient will just be the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, multiplied by whatever the entire second part is. Wait, no, that doesn't sound right. Let me think again. Actually, when you multiply two expressions together, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression. But since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first part will just be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, but since we're only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and the second expansion doesn't have any \\(a\\) or \\(b\\) terms, then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product will just be the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the entire second expression, but that doesn't make sense because the second expression is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a separate variable. Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when you multiply these two expressions, each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are different variables, the only way \\(a^2b^2\\) can appear in the product is if we take the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part and multiply it by the constant term (the term with \\(c^0\\)) from the second part. Because if we take any other term from the second part, it will have a \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\) term, which would make the product have \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or something like that, but we only want \\(a^2b^2\\), so the \\(c\\) terms must cancel out. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part. So, I need to find two things: 1. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which I already found to be 6. 2. The coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me work on the second part. So, expanding \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem: \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k\\). Simplifying that, it's \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} c^{-k} = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We want the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(6 = 2k\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Now, going back to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the product of the coefficients from each part, which is 6 * 20 = 120. Wait, but let me make sure I'm not missing anything. Is there any other way \\(a^2b^2\\) could appear? For example, if the second part had terms with \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), but it doesn't\u2014it only has \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, the only contribution to \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from multiplying the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first part by the constant term in the second part. Therefore, the coefficient is indeed 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, let me double-check my calculations. For the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\), that's correct. For the second part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term where the exponent is 0 is when \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), so \\(k = 3\\), and the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, 6 * 20 is 120. That seems right.\n\nBut wait, another way to think about it is that when you multiply two expressions, the coefficients multiply for the terms you're interested in. Since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are in the first part, and \\(c\\) is in the second, the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) is to take \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first and \\(c^0\\) from the second. So, yes, 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nI think that's the correct answer. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem.\n\nFirst, consider the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n\\]\nWe need the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2, which corresponds to \\(k = 2\\). The coefficient for this term is:\n\\[\n\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\n\\]\n\nNext, consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem:\n\\[\n\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n\\]\nWe need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, which occurs when \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(k = 3\\). The coefficient for this term is:\n\\[\n\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\n\\]\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the product of the coefficients from each part:\n\\[\n6 \\times 20 = 120\n\\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}."

    "text": " Because \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would just be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but since we're only interested in \\(a^2b^2\\), the part involving \\(c\\) can be anything because it's multiplied by that term. Wait, no, actually, the question is about the coefficient in the entire product. So, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think again. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when we expand this, each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), that term in the first part comes with a coefficient of 6, as we found. Now, when we multiply this by the entire second part, which is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the 6 will be multiplied by each term in that expansion. But since the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, I think that the coefficient is just 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, that doesn't seem right because the problem might be asking for a specific term involving both \\(a^2b^2\\) and some \\(c\\) term, but I don't think so. Wait, actually, the problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", so maybe it's considering the entire product, but \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term from the first part, and the second part can be anything. So, perhaps the coefficient is just 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part, but that doesn't make sense because the question is just asking for a coefficient, not a polynomial. Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Maybe it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which would mean that the entire expression is being expanded, and we're looking for the term that has \\(a^2b^2\\) times some \\(c\\) term. But the problem doesn't specify any condition on \\(c\\), so maybe it's just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that's a polynomial, and the coefficient would be a polynomial itself, which doesn't make sense because coefficients are usually constants. Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me read the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, perhaps it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, meaning that when you expand the entire product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by various powers of \\(c\\), but the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem is phrased as \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", which usually refers to the coefficient when you're considering the entire expression as a polynomial in multiple variables. So, in that case, the coefficient would be the part that's multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), which is the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but multiplied by 6, right? Because in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient is 6. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems too broad because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. Wait, maybe I'm missing something. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when considering the entire product as a single polynomial, but that would mean that the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\). However, the problem might just be asking for the coefficient in the context of the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) part, treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable. So, in that case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which would be a polynomial in \\(c\\). But perhaps the problem is expecting a numerical coefficient, which would imply that maybe there's a specific term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) that we need to consider. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, meaning that it's 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that doesn't make sense because the sum of coefficients would be when \\(c = 1\\), but I don't think that's what's being asked here. Wait, maybe I should think differently. Let me try to approach it step by step.\n\nFirst, expand \\((a + b)^4\\). As we did earlier, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6.\n\nNow, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when we multiply these two, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by every term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems odd because the coefficient would then be a polynomial in \\(c\\), not a single number. So, maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, considering all variables, but that would require more information. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the \\((a + b)^4\\) part, which is 6, and then the rest is separate. But that doesn't make sense because the entire expression is the product, so the coefficients would be multiplied.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me try to think again. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). We need the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are in the first part, and \\(c\\) is in the second part, the variables are independent. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\). So, perhaps the problem is expecting us to write that coefficient as 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems unlikely because the problem is asking for the coefficient, which is usually a number. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some \\(k\\), but it's not specified. Alternatively, perhaps I'm misinterpreting the problem. Let me check again: it says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, perhaps it's considering the entire expression as a polynomial in \\(a, b, c\\), and we're to find the coefficient of the term \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But if the problem is asking for the coefficient, which is a number, then perhaps it's expecting a numerical value, which would only make sense if we're considering the term \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by a specific power of \\(c\\), but that's not specified. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the \\((a + b)^4\\) part, which is 6, and the rest is separate. But that seems too simple, and the problem includes the \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) part, so it's likely that the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of that part.\n\nWait, but let's think about it differently. If we consider the entire expression as a product, then the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by every term from the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. But that's not correct because each term in the second expansion is a monomial, not just a coefficient. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that's a polynomial, not a number. So, perhaps the problem is expecting us to recognize that the coefficient is 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that seems odd because usually, coefficients are constants.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when considering the entire product as a polynomial in \\(a, b, c\\), but without any constraints on \\(c\\). In that case, the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\), specifically 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, perhaps that's the answer.\n\nBut wait, let me check another approach. Maybe I'm supposed to treat the entire expression as a product and find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), treating \\(c\\) as another variable, but the problem doesn't specify any particular term in \\(c\\), so maybe the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Alternatively, perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the \\((a + b)^4\\) part, which is 6, and the rest is separate. But that seems too simple, and the problem includes the other part, so I think the correct approach is that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 times the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nWait, but let me think again. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when you multiply these two, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by every term in the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient is 6 multiplied by each term in that expansion, meaning the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\).\n\nBut the problem is phrased as \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", so perhaps it's expecting a polynomial in \\(c\\) as the coefficient. Therefore, the answer would be \\(6 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But let me check if that makes sense.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting a numerical coefficient, but that would only be possible if we're considering a specific term involving \\(c\\), which isn't specified. So, maybe the answer is indeed \\(6 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But let me see if there's another way to approach this.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think: when you have two polynomials multiplied together, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each polynomial. But in this case, we're looking for \\(a^2b^2\\), which only comes from the first polynomial, and the second polynomial contributes all its terms. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial times the entire second polynomial. So, yes, that would be 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nBut let me check an example. Suppose we have \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1)^1\\). The coefficient of \\(a^2b^0\\) would be 1 times \\((c + 1)\\), right? Because in the first part, the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) is 1, and in the second part, it's \\((c + 1)\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) in the product is \\((c + 1)\\). So, similarly, in our problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nWait, but maybe the problem is expecting a numerical coefficient, so perhaps I'm missing something. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when the entire expression is considered as a single polynomial, but that would require more context. Alternatively, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, and the second part is irrelevant. But that seems unlikely because the problem includes both parts.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, considering all variables, but without any constraints on \\(c\\). So, the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\), which is 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the answer would be \\(6 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But let me check if that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting a numerical coefficient, which would only be possible if we're considering a specific term in \\(c\\), but since it's not specified, I think the answer is 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(6 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nWait, but let me think again. If the problem had asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some specific \\(k\\), then we would need to find the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^k\\). But since it's just asking for \\(a^2b^2\\), without any condition on \\(c\\), the coefficient would be the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) multiplied by 6. So, yes, that seems correct.\n\nBut let me check another way. Let's compute the entire product and see what the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is. So, \\((a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). Now, when we multiply this by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is \\(6 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, that confirms my earlier conclusion.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(6 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But let me see if I can simplify that. Let me compute \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem, that's \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, the expansion is \\(\\dbinom{6}{0}c^6 + \\dbinom{6}{1}c^4 + \\dbinom{6}{2}c^2 + \\dbinom{6}{3}c^0 + \\dbinom{6}{4}c^{-2} + \\dbinom{6}{5}c^{-4} + \\dbinom{6}{6}c^{-6}\\). Calculating the coefficients: \\(\\dbinom{6}{0} = 1\\), \\(\\dbinom{6}{1} = 6\\), \\(\\dbinom{6}{2} = 15\\), \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\), \\(\\dbinom{6}{4} = 15\\), \\(\\dbinom{6}{5} = 6\\), \\(\\dbinom{6}{6} = 1\\). So, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15c^{-2} + 6c^{-4} + c^{-6}\\).\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(6 \\times (c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15c^{-2} + 6c^{-4} + c^{-6})\\). Multiplying each term by 6, we get:\n\n\\(6c^6 + 36c^4 + 90c^2 + 120 + 90c^{-2} + 36c^{-4} + 6c^{-6}\\).\n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is this entire polynomial. Therefore, the final answer is \\(6 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which expands to the polynomial above.\n\nBut wait, the problem didn't specify any particular term involving \\(c\\), so I think that's the answer. So, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), or, expanded, as I showed above.\n\nBut let me check if I made any mistakes. I think the key point is that when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in one polynomial is multiplied by the entire other polynomial. So, in this case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6, and when you multiply by the second polynomial, the coefficient becomes 6 times the second polynomial.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem had asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some specific \\(k\\), we would have to find the corresponding term. But since it's just \\(a^2b^2\\), the coefficient is 6 times the entire second polynomial.\n\nWait, but let me think again. The problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", so perhaps it's considering the entire product as a polynomial in \\(a, b, c\\), and the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the sum of all terms in the product that have \\(a^2b^2\\). But since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are only in the first part, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term is multiplied by every term in the second part. Therefore, the coefficient is indeed 6 times the entire second polynomial.\n\nSo, to summarize, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is \\(6 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which can be expanded as \\(6c^6 + 36c^4 + 90c^2 + 120 + 90c^{-2} + 36c^{-4} + 6c^{-6}\\).\n\nBut the problem might just be expecting the expression in terms of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), so the answer is \\(6 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which can be written as \\(6\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nWait, but let me check if that's correct. Let me take a simpler example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^1 \\times (c + 1)^1\\). The coefficient of \\(a\\) in the product would be 1 times \\((c + 1)\\), right? Because \\(a\\) is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. So, yes, that's correct.

    "text": " Because \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\). So, when I multiply the two expressions, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), the other factors involving \\(c\\) won't affect that coefficient. So, does that mean the coefficient remains 6? Wait, no, that doesn't seem right. Because when you multiply two expressions together, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, that can't be right because the question is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), not in \\(c\\). So, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think again. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are different variables, the only way to get a term involving \\(a^2b^2\\) is to take the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part and multiply it by any term from the second part. But since the second part is in terms of \\(c\\), the product will have terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some \\(k\\). But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). Wait, no, that can't be right because \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term on its own, but in the product, it's multiplied by terms involving \\(c\\). So, actually, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, that doesn't make sense because the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), so that would be \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 * 64 = 384. But that seems high. Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second part, which is 64, as I thought before. So, 6 * 64 = 384. But wait, maybe I'm supposed to consider that when multiplying by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term is multiplied by a power of \\(c\\), but since we're only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\), then yes, it would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second part. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, without considering \\(c\\), so that would be 6, because the \\(c\\) part doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) coefficients. Wait, that seems conflicting. Let me think differently. When you have two independent variables, \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and \\(c\\), the coefficients of terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are independent of the coefficients involving \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, that coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 64. So, 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only considering the terms where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out, so that the term is a constant. But the problem doesn't specify that, so I think it's just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient is 6 times 64, which is 384. Wait, but let me check that. Let me consider \\((a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. Now, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) can be expanded using the binomial theorem as well. So, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, the expansion is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). Now, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), resulting in terms like \\(6a^2b^2 c^{6 - 2k}\\) for each \\(k\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients from the \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) expansion. But the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 * 64 = 384. So, I think that's the answer. Let me just make sure I didn't make a mistake. So, step by step: 1. Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) and find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is 6. 2. Recognize that when multiplying by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second. 3. Since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), we need to consider all the terms that result from multiplying \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion. 4. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is therefore 6 multiplied by the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion. 5. The sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 64. 6. Therefore, 6 * 64 = 384. Yeah, that seems correct.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. When this is multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion is 64 (found by setting \\(c = 1\\)). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n\\(\\boxed{384}\\)"

So, when I multiply the two expansions, only the constant term (with respect to \\(c\\)) from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) will contribute to the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. Because if I take any other term from the second expansion, it would involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), which wouldn't be part of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, I just need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me think about how to find that. Again, using the binomial theorem, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying that, it's \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m} = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). Now, I need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero because that's the constant term. So, set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\): \\(6 = 2m\\) => \\(m = 3\\).

But that can't be, because the coefficient should be a number, not an expression. Wait, perhaps I'm misinterpreting the question. Maybe it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, treating \\(c\\) as a variable, but I think that's not the case. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is written incorrectly, and it's supposed to be \\((a + b + c + 1/c)^4\\) or something else. But no, the problem is as given. Hmm, maybe I need to consider that when multiplying the two expressions, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\).

Wait, maybe the problem is just to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), so the coefficient would be 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that's not a number, it's an expression. I'm confused. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, meaning that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't make sense either because the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) depend on the power of \\(c\\). Wait, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), so the coefficient would be 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that's not a numerical coefficient. I'm stuck. Maybe I should look at the problem again. It says: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, perhaps the answer is simply 6, because in the product, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term is multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the entire expansion, which is not a number. Alternatively, maybe the problem is expecting me to consider that the \\(c\\) terms are separate, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just 6, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. That might make sense because when you multiply by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), it's like multiplying by a polynomial in \\(c\\), but the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would still be 6, because it's multiplied by all the terms in \\(c\\). But I'm not sure. Wait, let me think about it differently. If I have two polynomials, say \\(P(a, b)\\) and \\(Q(c)\\), then the product \\(P(a, b) \\times Q(c)\\) will have terms where each term in \\(P\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(Q\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(P(a, b)\\) multiplied by the entire polynomial \\(Q(c)\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times \\(Q(c)\\), which is 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that's not a numerical coefficient; it's a polynomial in \\(c\\). Therefore, perhaps the problem is miswritten, or I'm misinterpreting it. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating all variables as separate, but that's not standard. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), meaning the constant term in \\(c\\). That is, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). That would make sense because then we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times the constant term in \\(c\\). So, let me assume that's what the problem is asking. So, first, find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then find the constant term (i.e., the coefficient of \\(c^0\\)) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), and then multiply them together. That would give the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product, which is the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times the constant term in \\(c\\). So, let's proceed with that assumption. First, as before, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. Now, I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). To find the constant term, I can use the binomial theorem again. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(1/c\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which implies \\(k = 3\\). So, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, the constant term is 20. Now, multiplying the two coefficients together: 6 (from \\(a^2b^2\\)) times 20 (from the constant term in \\(c\\)) gives 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) (times \\(c^0\\)) in the product is 120. So, I think that's the answer. Let me just double-check my steps. First, I expanded \\((a + b)^4\\) and found the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. Then, I considered that the problem might be asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times the constant term in \\(c\\), so I found the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) by setting the exponent to 0, which gave \\(k = 3\\), and the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying 6 and 20 gives 120. That seems correct. I don't think I made any mistakes in the calculations. So, the final answer should be 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then finding the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20. Multiplying these together gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{120}"

Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). Wait, but that seems high. Let me check my reasoning again. Alternatively, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, considering all possible terms, but since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), the coefficient would just be the product of the coefficients from each part. So, the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the coefficient from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is the sum of all coefficients, which is 64, so 6 times 64 is 384. But wait, that seems correct. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only considering the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), but the problem didn't specify any \\(c\\) term, so I think my initial approach is correct. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it, and the answer is simply 6 because the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. Wait, that can't be right because the entire expression includes the \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) part, so the coefficient would involve that part as well. Let me try another approach. Let's consider the entire expression as a product of two independent expansions. So, \\((a + b)^4\\) has terms \\(a^4, 4a^3b, 6a^2b^2, 4ab^3, b^4\\). And \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) can be expanded using the binomial theorem as well. The expansion is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(1/c\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, each term in the second expansion is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\) for \\(m\\) from 0 to 6. Now, when we multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), resulting in terms like \\(6a^2b^2 \\times \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients from the second expansion, because each term in the second expansion contributes its coefficient when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). Wait, but that seems correct. Alternatively, perhaps I'm missing something because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but in the product, each term would have a specific power of \\(c\\), so perhaps the problem is only considering the term where the power of \\(c\\) is zero, i.e., the constant term. Let me check that. If that's the case, then I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product, which would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) from the second part. So, first, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, as before. Then, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is the middle term, which occurs when the exponent is zero. Let's find that. The general term in the expansion is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) would be \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). But the problem didn't specify any \\(c\\) term, so I'm confused now. It just asks for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would include all possible powers of \\(c\\). So, in that case, it's 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, giving 384. Alternatively, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) term, then it's 6 times 64, which is 384. But if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it's 120. Hmm, the problem statement is a bit ambiguous. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" It doesn't specify any \\(c\\) term, so perhaps it's considering all possible \\(c\\) terms, so the coefficient would be 6 times 64, which is 384. Alternatively, maybe the problem is expecting just the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, but that seems unlikely because the entire expression includes the second part. Wait, but perhaps the problem is considering the product as a whole, and the \\(a^2b^2\\) term is multiplied by the entire second expansion, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would indeed be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, so 384. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it, and the answer is just 6, but that seems too simple given the problem includes the second part. Let me think again. When you have two polynomials multiplied together, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each polynomial. But in this case, \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term in the first polynomial, and the second polynomial has terms with \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second polynomial, each of those terms will have a coefficient, and the resulting term will be \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by each of those coefficients. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the sum of all those coefficients from the second polynomial multiplied by 6. So, the sum of the coefficients in the second polynomial is 64, so 6 times 64 is 384. Therefore, the coefficient is 384. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which would indeed be 384. So, after all that, I think the answer is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplying it by the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The sum of the coefficients in the second expression is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), giving \\(2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n\\boxed{384}"

Wait, no, because when you multiply two expressions together, the terms can combine in different ways. But actually, since the second part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which expands into terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), but since we're looking for a term that only has \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), without any \\(c\\), we need to consider if any term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) can produce a constant term (i.e., a term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero).

So, the first part gives me 6 for \\(a^2b^2\\), and the second part, when expanded, has a term with \\(c^0\\) which is 20. Since I'm multiplying the two expansions together, any term in the first expansion will multiply every term in the second expansion. But since I'm only interested in the \\(a^2b^2\\) term, which is a term from the first expansion, it will only be multiplied by the \\(c^0\\) term from the second expansion, because any other term in the second expansion would introduce a \\(c\\) term, which would make the overall term have \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some \\(k\\), but we only want \\(a^2b^2\\), which has \\(k=0\\).

    "text": " Because \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\). So, maybe the coefficient is just 6 times whatever the coefficient is from the second part when multiplied by 1? Wait, no, that's not quite right. Let me think again. When I multiply two expressions, the terms combine. So, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since I'm only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), I need to find the part of the second expression that, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), doesn't involve \\(c\\). Wait, that means I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because if I multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by a constant, it will just be a constant times \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient will be 6 (from the first part) times the constant term from the second part. So, now I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me expand that using the binomial theorem as well. So, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying that, each term becomes \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\times c^{-m} = \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). Now, the constant term is when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. So, set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\) so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Let me compute that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20. Therefore, the coefficient from the second part is 20. Now, since I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is in the first part, and the constant term from the second part, the overall coefficient is 6 times 20. Let me calculate that: 6 * 20 = 120. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120. Wait, let me just make sure I didn't miss anything. So, in the first part, \\(a^2b^2\\) has a coefficient of 6, and in the second part, the constant term is 20. Since these are multiplied together, the total coefficient is 6*20=120. That seems right.

But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), that term will be multiplied by every term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, actually, no. Because \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term from the first part, and when we multiply by the second part, each term in the first part gets multiplied by each term in the second part. So, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will be multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, maybe we're just looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, considering all possible terms. Wait, no, actually, I think I might have misread the problem. Let me check again. The problem says: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)\". So, the expression is a product of two binomials, one involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), the other involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, when you multiply them, the terms will involve products of terms from each expansion. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). That means we need to find all the terms in the product where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2 each, and then sum up their coefficients. So, in other words, we need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which we found to be 6, and then multiply it by the sum of all coefficients in the second part, because every term in the second expansion will multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. Wait, is that correct? Let me think. If I have \\((a + b)^4\\) times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), then each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Because each term in the second part contributes a coefficient that multiplies the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. So, first, let's confirm the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is indeed 6, as I found earlier. Then, the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) can be found by setting \\(c = 1\\), because substituting 1 for \\(c\\) will make each term equal to its coefficient. So, let's compute \\(\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = (2)^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). Wait, but let me make sure I'm not missing something here. Is there a possibility that the \\(c\\) terms could affect the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\)? No, because \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\). So, when you multiply, the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) don't interact with those of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just the product of the coefficient from the first part and the sum of coefficients from the second part. So, that would make it 6 * 64 = 384. Hmm, that seems straightforward, but let me double-check. Alternatively, maybe I can think of it as the entire product being the product of two separate expansions, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would indeed be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, giving 384. Alternatively, if I were to expand both expressions, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term would be multiplied by every term in the second expansion, so each of those would contribute to the overall coefficient. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\), we can just take the coefficient from the first part and multiply by the sum of coefficients from the second part.

Wait, but that doesn't make sense because the second part is a separate variable. So, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Let me try to think differently. The expression is a product of two independent binomial expansions. So, when you multiply them, the variables \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are only in the first part, and \\(c\\) is only in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part will be multiplied by every term in the second expansion.

Expanding \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem: \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the exponent of \\(c\\) is \\(6 - 2m\\). For the term to be constant (i.e., exponent 0), we need \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which gives \\(m = 3\\). So, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) includes a constant term of 20. Therefore, when we multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by 20, the constant term from the second part. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Wait, but let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. Is the coefficient just 6 because that's the coefficient in the first part, and the second part doesn't affect it? But no, because when you multiply two expressions, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), the only contribution comes from the constant term in the second expansion. So, the coefficient would be 6 (from the first part) times 20 (the constant term from the second part), which is 120. Alternatively, maybe I should think of it as the product of the two coefficients. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 20. So, when you multiply these two, you get 6 * 20 = 120.

So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).

As I calculated before, the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 384. But let me check that again. Let me expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem. So, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the expansion has terms with exponents of \\(c\\) ranging from 6 (when m=0) to -6 (when m=6). So, each term in the expansion is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). Now, when we multiply this by \\((a + b)^4\\), which has a term \\(6a^2b^2\\), the product will have terms like \\(6a^2b^2 \\times \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\) for each m from 0 to 6. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each of these terms, resulting in \\(6 \\dbinom{6}{m} a^2b^2 c^{6 - 2m}\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is actually a polynomial in \\(c\\), specifically \\(6 \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). But that's not a numerical coefficient; it's a polynomial. Therefore, perhaps the problem is intended to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and the second part is irrelevant because it's multiplied by different variables. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when the entire expression is expanded, but since \\(c\\) is a separate variable, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the entire expansion of the second part, which is 6 * 64 = 384, as I thought earlier.

So, then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 * 64 = 384. But wait, that seems a bit high. Let me check my reasoning again. Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Since the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from \\((a + b)^4\\), and when you multiply by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). However, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), so when you multiply it by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 multiplied by the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 64, as I thought earlier. So, 6 * 64 = 384. But wait, another way to think about it is that the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6, and when you multiply by the second part, which is a polynomial in \\(c\\), each term in the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is 6, and the rest is in terms of \\(c\\), the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial. So, if we're just looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, then it's 6 times the sum of the coefficients of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without considering the \\(c\\) terms, so it's just 6. But that doesn't make sense because the entire expression is a product, so each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), so the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 64, giving 384. Wait, but maybe I'm confusing the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\)\". So, it's the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, in other words, we're looking for all terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) appears, and each such term will be multiplied by some power of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the sum of all the coefficients from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) multiplied by 6. So, the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is when \\(c = 1\\), which is \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 * 64 = 384. Wait, but another way to think about it is that \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is a polynomial where each term is of the form \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(1/c\\right)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, the coefficients are \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}\\), and when we sum all the coefficients, we set \\(c = 1\\), which gives 2^6 = 64, as before. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it, and the answer is just 6 because the \\(c\\) terms don't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) coefficients. But that seems incorrect because the entire expression is a product, so each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second part. Therefore, I think the correct coefficient is 384. Wait, but let me check with an example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^1 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, the expansion is \\((a + b)(c + 1/c)\\). The coefficient of \\(a\\) would be 1 times the sum of coefficients in \\((c + 1/c)\\), which is 2. So, the coefficient of \\(a\\) would be 2, and similarly for \\(b\\). So, in that case, the coefficient of \\(a\\) is 2, which is 1 (from \\((a + b)^1\\)) times 2 (sum of coefficients in the second part). So, applying that logic here, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. Therefore, I think the answer is 384. Wait, but let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. Alternatively, perhaps the coefficient is just 6 because the other part doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. But that doesn't seem right because when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part would be multiplied by every term in the second part, so the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second part, which is 64. So, 6 * 64 = 384. Yeah, that seems correct. So, the coefficient is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is found using the binomial theorem, which gives 6. Since the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 multiplied by the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is \\(2^6 = 64\\). Thus, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n\\boxed{384}"

Wait, no, that's not right. Because when you multiply two expressions, each term in the first expression is multiplied by each term in the second. But in this case, we're looking for a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), so perhaps we need to find the term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) that has \\(c^0\\), which would be the constant term. Because if we have \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part, and then we multiply it by a constant term from the second part, that would give us a term with \\(a^2b^2\\) and some coefficient. Alternatively, if we multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by a term with \\(c^k\\), then the resulting term would have \\(c^k\\), but since we're only interested in \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\), maybe I need to consider the entire expansion. Wait, no, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product. So, perhaps I need to consider all the terms in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) and multiply them by the corresponding terms in \\((a + b)^4\\), but only the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), because if it's multiplied by a \\(c\\) term, then the resulting term would have \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), which isn't just \\(a^2b^2\\). So, maybe I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), and then multiply it by the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6. That sounds more accurate. So, let me find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We want the exponent of \\(c\\) to be zero, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficients from each part, which is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Wait, but hold on a second. Let me make sure I'm not missing anything here. The problem is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). When you expand this product, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But we are only interested in the term where the product is \\(a^2b^2\\) times a constant (i.e., \\(c^0\\)), because any other power of \\(c\\) would make the term have \\(c\\) in it, which we don't want. So, the coefficient is indeed 6 (from \\(a^2b^2\\)) multiplied by 20 (the constant term), giving 120. So, I think that's correct. Wait, but just to be thorough, let me check if there's any other way this could happen. For example, could there be a term where \\(c\\) is raised to some power that cancels out, but that seems unlikely because in the second part, each term is either \\(c^k\\) or \\(c^{-k}\\), but when multiplied by the first part, which has no \\(c\\) terms, the only way to get a term without \\(c\\) is to multiply by the constant term. So, yeah, I think 120 is the correct coefficient.\n\nWait, but let me think again. When you multiply two expressions, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\), and it's multiplied by every term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, does that mean that each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) contributes to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product? Wait, no, because if you have \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by \\(c^k\\), that would give a term \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), which is different from \\(a^2b^2\\). So, actually, only the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) would multiply with \\(a^2b^2\\) to give a term that is just \\(a^2b^2\\) times that constant. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is indeed the product of the coefficients from each part, which is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). So, I think that's the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break down the problem into two parts using the binomial theorem.\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\):**\n   Using the binomial theorem, the term with \\(a^2b^2\\) is given by \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}a^2b^2\\).

But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I think it's enough to just consider the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) and then realize that when we multiply by the other expression, it might just get multiplied by 1, or perhaps the constant term. Wait, no, actually, I think I need to consider how the two parts interact. Wait, but no, because \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), so when we expand the entire expression, each term from \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).

Wait, no, the problem just says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", without mentioning \\(c\\). Hmm, maybe I need to think differently. Wait, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, in other words, when you multiply the two expressions together, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will be present in each term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, that might not be correct. Let me think again. Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the entire expression is a product of two independent expressions, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, so the coefficient would be the product of the coefficients from each part. Wait, but that can't be right because the two parts are multiplied together, so the terms would combine. Let me try to approach this differently. Let me first find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6 as I found earlier. Now, when I multiply this by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) gets multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by every term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be \\(6\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) would be found by setting \\(c = 1\\), because substituting \\(c = 1\\) into \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) gives \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of all coefficients is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). But wait, that seems too straightforward. Let me check that again. Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. The problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Since \\(c\\) and \\(a\\), \\(b\\) are separate variables, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't make sense because the coefficient would then be a polynomial in \\(c\\), not a constant. Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, without considering the \\(c\\) terms, meaning that the \\(c\\) part can be anything, so the coefficient would just be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, that would be \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). Alternatively, perhaps the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), so it's 6 times the entire expansion, but that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial. That doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me think again. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is indeed 64, as I found earlier by setting \\(c = 1\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). But wait, let me verify that. Let me consider a simpler case. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^1 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, \\((a + b)(c + 1/c)\\). The coefficient of \\(a^1b^0\\) would be 1 times the sum of coefficients in \\((c + 1/c)\\), which is 2. So, the coefficient of \\(a\\) would be 2, and the coefficient of \\(b\\) would also be 2. Similarly, in the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times 64, which is 384. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some \\(k\\), but since it's not specified, I think the intended answer is 384. Alternatively, perhaps I should think of it as the product of the two expansions, and since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be the product of the coefficients from each part. But that doesn't seem right because each term is multiplied by each term. Wait, no, actually, when you multiply two polynomials, each term from the first is multiplied by each term from the second. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial. Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second polynomial, each term contributes its own coefficient, and since \\(a^2b^2\\) is just a term, the total coefficient would be the product of \\(a^2b^2\\)'s coefficient and the sum of the coefficients of the second polynomial. So, that would be 6 times 64, which is 384. Therefore, I think the coefficient is 384. Let me double-check this. Alternatively, perhaps I can think of it as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the coefficient of \\(1\\) (the constant term) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is the number of ways to choose 3 \\(c\\) terms and 3 \\(1/c\\) terms, which would be \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Wait, but then if I multiply 6 by 20, I get 120, which is different from 384. Hmm, so which is correct? Wait, perhaps I'm confusing something here. Let me clarify. The problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. So, when I expand \\((a + b)^4\\), I get terms like \\(a^4, a^3b, a^2b^2, ab^3, b^4\\). Similarly, when I expand \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), I get terms like \\(c^6, c^4, c^2, 1, 1/c^2, 1/c^4, 1/c^6\\). Now, when I multiply these two expansions together, each term from the first is multiplied by each term from the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term from the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion (which is 6) multiplied by the entire second expansion. But that would mean that the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. Therefore, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), meaning the term where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out. In that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). The coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\), because we need to choose 3 \\(c\\) terms and 3 \\(1/c\\) terms to get \\(c^3 \\times 1/c^3 = c^0\\). So, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, the coefficient would be 6 times 20, which is 120. Hmm, that makes more sense because 120 is a numerical coefficient, whereas 384 was a polynomial. So, perhaps the problem is implicitly asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be 120. Let me check this again. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is indeed asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), but that would mean it's a polynomial in \\(c\\), which isn't a numerical coefficient. Therefore, it's more likely that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be 120. Let me think about this again. When you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would actually be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which would make the coefficient a polynomial in \\(c\\). But since the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, it's probably looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), which is 6 times 20, which is 120. So, I think that's the correct answer. To confirm, let's compute the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem, the general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(1/c\\right)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We want the exponent of \\(c\\) to be 0, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which implies \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Thus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Therefore, the answer is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplying it by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20.

Wait, that doesn't make sense. Let me think again. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when expanded, each term in the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second part. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by every term in the second expansion. But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), that means we need to find the coefficient in the first part and then multiply it by the coefficient of the term in the second part that is \\(c^0\\), because that's the only way \\(a^2b^2\\) can stay as \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms. So, in other words, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Therefore, I need to compute two things: 1. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which I already found to be 6. 2. The coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me work on the second part now. So, expanding \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem, we have: \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} c^{-k} = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Let's solve for \\(k\\): \\(6 - 2k = 0 \\implies 2k = 6 \\implies k = 3\\). So, the term where \\(k = 3\\) is the one with \\(c^0\\). The coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Now, going back to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the two coefficients we found: 6 (from \\(a^2b^2\\)) and 20 (from \\(c^0\\)). So, 6 multiplied by 20 is 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 120.\n\nWait a second, let me double-check to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. So, first, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Then, in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term where the exponent is 0 is when \\(k = 3\\), so the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying these together gives 6 * 20 = 120. That seems correct. I don't think I made any calculation errors here. So, yeah, the coefficient should be 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem.\n\nFirst, consider the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\). Using the binomial theorem, we have:\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n\\]\nThe term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\), so the coefficient is:\n\\[\n\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\n\\]\n\nNext, consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem, we have:\n\\[\n\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n\\]\nWe need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, which occurs when \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(k = 3\\). The coefficient is:\n\\[\n\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\n\\]\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficients from both expansions:\n\\[\n6 \\times 20 = 120\n\\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}."

Wait, no, that's not quite right. Because the entire expression is the product of two expansions. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would actually be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a term is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each polynomial. But in this case, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term is only from the first part, and the second part contributes all the terms, so the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Wait, but the second part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The sum of all coefficients would be when we set \\(c = 1\\), because substituting \\(c = 1\\) into the expression gives the sum of coefficients. So, let me calculate that: \\(\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = (2)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the sum of all coefficients in the second part is 64. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 64 (from the second part), which is 6 * 64. Let me compute that: 6 * 60 = 360, and 6 * 4 = 24, so 360 + 24 = 384. Wait, but hold on a second. Is that correct? Because the second part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which when expanded, has terms like \\(c^6\\), \\(c^4\\), ..., down to \\(c^{-6}\\). But when we multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), the \\(c\\) terms would just be multiplied along. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would indeed be 6 * 64, which is 384. So, the coefficient is 384. Wait, but let me double-check. Alternatively, perhaps I should think of it as the product of the two expansions. So, the first expansion has terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the second has terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). Since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are different variables, the terms involving \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by every term in the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. Yeah, that seems right. So, I think the coefficient is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is found by expanding \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem, which gives a coefficient of 6 for \\(a^2b^2\\).

Wait, that doesn't seem right. Let me think again. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^4 = A\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = B\\). Then, the product is \\(A \\times B\\). If I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), that term comes only from the part of \\(A\\) that is \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by every term in \\(B\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(A\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(B\\). But wait, that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(B\\), which is a sum of terms with \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), so maybe the \\(c\\) terms don't affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, no, that can't be right. Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in \\(B\\), each term in \\(B\\) is a power of \\(c\\), so each term in the product will be \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or something like that. But the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, perhaps the coefficient is just 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(B\\). Wait, but that doesn't make sense because the coefficients in \\(B\\) depend on the powers of \\(c\\). Alternatively, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable, so the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(B\\), but that seems too large. Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think differently. Since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are all separate variables, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will only come from the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the term \\(1\\) (the constant term) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because any other term in \\(B\\) would have a \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\) factor, which would make the term not just \\(a^2b^2\\) but something like \\(a^2b^2c\\) or \\(a^2b^2/c\\), which are different terms. So, maybe I only need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), and then multiply it by 6 to get the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Let me check that. So, first, find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6. Then, find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. Let me compute that. Using the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We need the term where the exponent is zero, so 6 - 2k = 0. Solving for k, 6 = 2k => k = 3. So, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (the constant term from the second part), which is 6 * 20 = 120. Wait, but I'm not sure if that's correct. Let me think again. When I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second part, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) where k varies. But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would mean we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). Wait, but that's not possible because \\(a^2b^2\\) would have to be multiplied by some term in \\(c\\). So, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times the constant term (i.e., the term where \\(c^0\\)), so that the overall term is \\(a^2b^2\\). In that case, the coefficient would be 6 * 20 = 120. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, which would include all possible powers of \\(c\\). But that would mean the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which would make the coefficient a sum of terms with different powers of \\(c\\). But that doesn't make sense because the coefficient should be a single number, not a polynomial. So, perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when considering the product, but regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which would mean that we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, so each term in the product is a term like \\(a^kb^{4 - k}c^m\\), and we're looking for the coefficient where \\(k = 2\\) and \\(4 - k = 2\\), so \\(a^2b^2\\), but without any restriction on \\(c\\). Wait, but that would mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the same as the coefficient in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which would make the coefficient a sum over all possible \\(c\\) terms. But that can't be right because the coefficient should be a number, not a polynomial. Therefore, I think the correct interpretation is that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which would mean that we need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by any term from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but since \\(a^2b^2\\) is independent of \\(c\\), the coefficient would actually be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which would make the coefficient a sum of terms with \\(c\\). But that seems odd. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable, so the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which would result in a polynomial in \\(c\\). But that would mean the coefficient is not a single number but a polynomial. That doesn't make sense because the problem asks for the coefficient, which should be a number. Therefore, I think the correct approach is that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, considering all possible terms from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), so the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Wait, but the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), so \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient would be 6 * 64 = 384. But that seems too high. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only interested in the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2 each, regardless of the exponents of \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which would make the coefficient a sum of terms with different powers of \\(c\\). But that doesn't seem right because the problem is asking for a coefficient, which is a single number. So, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me re-examine the problem: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, in the entire expansion, each term is of the form \\(a^kb^{4 - k}c^m\\) where \\(k\\) ranges from 0 to 4 and \\(m\\) ranges based on the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would correspond to \\(k = 2\\), and the coefficient would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) times the sum of all terms in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that's not quite right because each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) has a different power of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would actually be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is found by substituting \\(c = 1\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), giving \\(2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient would be 6 * 64 = 384. But that seems high. Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Maybe the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, meaning that we treat \\(c\\) as a separate variable, and the coefficient is just 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a coefficient, which is a number. Therefore, I think the correct approach is that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, so the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would make the coefficient a polynomial, which is not a single number. Therefore, perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, and since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), the coefficient is just 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't make sense because the coefficient should be a single number. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only interested in the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 20, so the coefficient would be 6 * 20 = 120. That seems more reasonable. Let me confirm. If I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and I want the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by the constant term in the second expression, then the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120. Alternatively, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, then it's 6 times the entire expansion, which would be a polynomial, but that's not a single number. Therefore, I think the intended interpretation is that we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, considering all possible powers of \\(c\\), but that would mean the coefficient is a sum of terms with \\(c\\), which isn't a single number.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and not worrying about the other part. But that can't be because the expression is the product of two parts, so the coefficients would multiply. Therefore, I think the correct answer is 120. Let me check my steps again: 1. Coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. 2. The constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 20. 3. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 * 20 = 120.

When you expand this, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first part is \\(6a^2b^2\\).

But I'm not sure if that's correct because the problem might just be asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, so maybe it's 6 times the sum of the coefficients, which is 384. Alternatively, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)\". So, it's the coefficient when considering all terms, but only looking at the \\(a^2b^2\\) part, and summing over all possible \\(c\\) terms. So, in other words, the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. So, 6 times 64 is 384. Alternatively, maybe I can think of it as the entire expression is the product of two independent expansions, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient from the first part times the sum of coefficients from the second part. So, yes, that would make it 6 * 64 = 384. But let me check another way. Let's consider that when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each polynomial. But in this case, the first polynomial has terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the second has terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, when you multiply them, the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from those involving \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial. Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second polynomial, each term contributes its coefficient to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^k\\) or \\(c^{-k}\\). So, the total coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) across all possible \\(c\\) terms is indeed 6 times 64, which is 384. Wait, but let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. Let me think of a simpler example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, expanding this, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^0\\) would be \\(\\dbinom{2}{0} = 1\\) times the sum of coefficients in \\((c + 1/c)\\), which is \\(1 + 1 = 2\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) would be 1 * 2 = 2. Let me check that by expanding: \\((a + b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2\\), and \\((c + 1/c) = c + 1/c\\). So, multiplying, we get \\(a^2(c + 1/c) + 2ab(c + 1/c) + b^2(c + 1/c)\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) is indeed 1 * (1 + 1) = 2. So, that seems to work. Similarly, if I take \\((a + b)^1 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\), the coefficient of \\(a^1b^0\\) would be \\(\\dbinom{1}{0} = 1\\) times 2, so 2. And indeed, expanding, you get \\(a(c + 1/c) + b(c + 1/c)\\), so the coefficient of \\(a\\) is 1 * 2 = 2. So, applying this logic, in the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times 64, which is 384. Therefore, I think that's the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Then, since the second factor \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) contributes a sum of coefficients equal to \\(2^6 = 64\\) when \\(c = 1\\), the total coefficient is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\boxed{384}."

Wait, no, actually, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first polynomial gets multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. However, since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), that means we can consider the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) for \\(a^2b^2\\) and then multiply it by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because each term in that expansion will multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. But wait, no, that's not right. Actually, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term is only from \\((a + b)^4\\), and the \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) part is separate. So, when you multiply the two expressions together, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, that means we're considering the entire product.

But that doesn't make sense because when you multiply, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) gets multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), so the \\(a^2b^2\\) term would be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, that implies that the coefficient would be the same as in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire sum of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is not correct because each term in the second expansion is a separate term. Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When you expand this, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) and \\(a^2b^2c^{-k}\\) for various exponents \\(k\\). But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. Wait, that doesn't make sense because \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term without \\(c\\), so to get \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, you'd need to multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by 1 (the term that doesn't involve \\(c\\)) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, in other words, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because only the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero would contribute to \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms. So, that makes sense now. So, first, find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which we found to be 6. Then, find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Then, multiply those two coefficients together to get the final coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product. So, let's work on the second part: the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Again, we can use the binomial theorem here. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k\\). Simplifying each term, that becomes \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} c^{-k} = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so we set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Now, multiplying this by the coefficient from the first part, which was 6, we get \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120. Wait, let me double-check that. So, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. In \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. So, when you multiply these two parts together, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part is multiplied by the constant term (c^0) from the second part, which is 20. So, 6 times 20 is indeed 120. That seems correct. So, the final coefficient is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is found by considering the binomial expansions of each part. \n\n1.

But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), that term would come from the product where the \\(c\\) terms cancel out to 1. Hmm, wait, no.

Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, perhaps the problem is treating \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) as separate variables, and it's asking for the coefficient of the term where \\(a\\) is squared, \\(b\\) is squared, and \\(c\\) is raised to some power. But the way the problem is phrased, it's just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), without specifying anything about \\(c\\). Hmm. Alternatively, maybe the problem is considering \\(c\\) as a separate variable, and it's looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). But that seems a bit ambiguous. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting me to consider only the constant term in \\(c\\), so that when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), you're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), meaning the constant term in \\(c\\). That would make sense because otherwise, the coefficient would be a polynomial, and the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. So, maybe I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\) in the product. Let me proceed under that assumption. So, first, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, as I found earlier. Now, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Once I have that, I can multiply it by 6 to get the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product, which would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) if we're considering only the constant term in \\(c\\). So, let's find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Again, using the binomial theorem, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be 0, so set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(k = 3\\). So, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\), which is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Now, going back to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Since these two terms are multiplied together in the product, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is 120. Wait, but let me make sure I'm not missing anything here. So, to recap: The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) with coefficient 6. The term \\(c^0\\) comes from the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) with coefficient 20. When we multiply these two expansions together, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion is multiplied by every term in the second expansion. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), that would actually be the sum of all the coefficients where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any power of \\(c\\). Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, no, if we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then it's actually the coefficient 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be \\(6 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient, which is a number. So, maybe I was wrong earlier, and the problem is indeed asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the constant term in \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times 20, which is 120. Alternatively, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), then it's 6 times the entire expansion, which would be a polynomial. But since the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, I think it's safe to assume that it's asking for the constant term in \\(c\\), so 120 is the answer. Let me just double-check my steps. First, expanding \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. Then, expanding \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20.

    "text": " Because \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\). So, maybe I just need to consider the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) and then see if the other part affects it. Wait, no. The entire expression is the product of \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when you multiply two polynomials, each term from the first polynomial gets multiplied by each term from the second polynomial. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't have any \\(c\\) terms, that means we need to find the term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) that has \\(c^0\\), because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by \\(c^0\\), you just get \\(a^2b^2\\), which is what we're looking for. So, maybe I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me think about that. Again, using the binomial theorem, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying that, it's \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m} = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We want the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\), which is \\(\\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20. Now, going back to the original expression, when we multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by the constant term 20 from the second part. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficients from each part, which is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Wait, is that right? Let me double-check. So, \\((a + b)^4\\) gives 6 for \\(a^2b^2\\), and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) gives 20 for \\(c^0\\). So, when you multiply these two, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) gets multiplied by 20, giving 6 * 20 = 120. Yeah, that seems correct. I don't think I made any mistakes here.

Wait, but actually, no. Because when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficients multiply as well. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all the terms in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't make sense because the sum of all terms in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) isn't a single number; it's a polynomial. Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\). So, when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by every term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).

But that can't be right because then the coefficient would depend on \\(c\\), which it shouldn't. Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, in other words, when you expand the entire expression, you'll have terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for various \\(k\\), but the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the sum of all the coefficients from each term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is such that \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by some power of \\(c\\). But that seems complicated. Alternatively, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, but since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are different variables, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the same as the coefficient in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that would mean the coefficient is 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial in \\(c\\), not a number. That doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. So, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me re-read the problem: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, maybe it's considering the entire expression as a polynomial in \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\), and it's asking for the coefficient of the term \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that can't be right because the coefficient should be a number, not a polynomial. Hmm, maybe I'm supposed to consider that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the sum of the coefficients of all terms in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean 6 times the sum of the coefficients, which is 6 times \\(2^6 = 64\\), so 6*64=384. Wait, but that seems too high. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think differently. Since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are separate variables, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) can be multiplied by any power of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial, not a number. That doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. So, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\). That would make sense because then the coefficient would be a number. So, maybe I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product. Let me assume that's the case. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) would be the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). That makes sense because when you multiply two terms, their coefficients multiply, and their variables multiply as well. So, if I can find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), then I can multiply that by 6 to get the desired coefficient. So, let's find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Again, using the binomial theorem, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, we need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be 0, which means \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Let me calculate that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire expression is 6 * 20 = 120. So, the answer should be 120.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. Is there another way to approach this? Maybe by considering the entire expansion. Let me think: \\((a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6. Then, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) expands to terms involving \\(c^6, c^4, c^2, c^0, c^{-2}, c^{-4}, c^{-6}\\). The coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20, as I found earlier. So, when I multiply these two expansions, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in the \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) expansion. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), that would actually be the sum of all the coefficients from the \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) expansion multiplied by 6. Wait, but that's different from what I thought earlier. So, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) irrespective of the power of \\(c\\), then the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). The sum of the coefficients in a polynomial is found by setting all variables to 1. So, setting \\(c = 1\\), \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of the coefficients is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 * 64 = 384. But wait, that contradicts my earlier conclusion of 120. So, which one is correct? Let me clarify the problem statement again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" The way it's phrased, it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), treating \\(c\\) as another variable. So, in the product, each term will be of the form \\(a^kb^{4 - k}c^m\\), where \\(k\\) ranges from 0 to 4 and \\(m\\) ranges based on the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is present in \\((a + b)^4\\) with coefficient 6, and it gets multiplied by every term in the \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) expansion. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), not a number. Therefore, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\). In that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 20 = 120. Alternatively, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then it's 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384. But I think the standard interpretation is that the coefficient is for the term \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), because otherwise, the coefficient would depend on \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense. So, I think the correct answer is 120.\n\nWait, but let me check another way. Let me consider the entire expansion. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\) with coefficient 6. Then, when multiplied by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), it becomes \\(6a^2b^2 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is \\(6 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that's a polynomial in \\(c\\), so the coefficient isn't a single number. Therefore, the problem must be asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 20 = 120. So, I think that's the correct answer.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, considering all possible powers of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but that doesn't make sense because the coefficient should be a number. Therefore, I think the intended interpretation is that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nWait, but let me think again. If the problem is written as \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), then the entire expression is a product of two polynomials. So, when you multiply them, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first polynomial will be multiplied by each term in the second polynomial, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), \\(a^2b^2c^2\\), \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), etc. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would actually be the sum of all these coefficients, meaning 6 times the sum of the coefficients of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Since the sum of the coefficients is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\(2^6 = 64\\), the total coefficient would be 6 * 64 = 384. But that seems high. Alternatively, if we're only considering the term where the power of \\(c\\) is zero, then it's 6 * 20 = 120. I think the problem is more likely asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), which would be 384. But I'm not entirely sure. Let me check the problem statement again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" The way it's phrased, it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would include all possible powers of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384. Therefore, I think the correct answer is 384.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was 120. Now I'm confused. Let me clarify: when the problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", it's referring to the coefficient of the term \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in the product, \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by every term from the second polynomial, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the entire second polynomial. But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, which doesn't make sense. Therefore, the problem must be asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\). So, in that case, the coefficient is 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second polynomial, which is 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the correct answer is 120.\n\nWait, but let me think about how coefficients work in products. If I have two polynomials, P(a, b) and Q(c), then the coefficient of a term in the product is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in P and Q. So, in this case, P(a, b) = (a + b)^4 and Q(c) = (c + 1/c)^6. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in P has coefficient 6, and the term \\(c^0\\) in Q has coefficient 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product is 6 * 20 = 120. If the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then it's 6 times the entire Q(c), which isn't a number. Therefore, the problem must be asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nSo, after all that, I think the correct answer is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is found by considering the expansion of each part separately and then combining the relevant coefficients.\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\), so its coefficient is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\n   \\]\n\n2. **Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n   \\]\n   The term with \\(c^0\\) (i.e., the constant term) occurs when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), so \\(m = 3\\).

Wait, no, that might not be correct. Let me think again. Actually, when you multiply the two expressions, each term from \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).

But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), I think the coefficient will just be the same as the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), perhaps I can think of it as the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum over all terms in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, that might not make sense because when you multiply, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second. So, perhaps the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't sound right because each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) has a different power of \\(c\\), so when you multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), the resulting term would have \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2c^{-k}\\) for some \\(k\\), but the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would only consider the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, meaning \\(c^0 = 1\\). So, perhaps I need to find the term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, and then multiply that by 6. That makes more sense. So, let me try that approach. First, I'll find the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem. The expansion is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying each term, that becomes \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m} = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). Now, I need to find the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, because that's the term that will contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). So, I set the exponent equal to zero: \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), I get \\(2m = 6\\) so \\(m = 3\\). So, the term where \\(m = 3\\) is the one I need. The coefficient for that term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Now, going back to the original expression, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Since these are multiplied together, the total coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 * 20 = 120. Wait, let me make sure I didn't miss anything. So, when you multiply two expressions together, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part and \\(c^0\\) from the second part will multiply to give \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is just \\(a^2b^2\\), and the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120. That seems right. Let me check if there's another way to think about this. Alternatively, I could consider that the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), and when expanding, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first part, and any term from the second part that doesn't involve \\(c\\) (i.e., \\(c^0\\)) would multiply with it to give the term \\(a^2b^2\\).

So, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). We need the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term from \\((a + b)^4\\), and when multiplied by any term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), it will still be \\(a^2b^2\\) times some power of \\(c\\).

Wait, but that's not correct because each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) has a coefficient multiplied by a power of \\(c\\), and when you multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), you get \\(a^2b^2\\) times that coefficient times \\(c^k\\), but the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would just be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, no, that's not quite right. Because in reality, when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second.

Wait, that doesn't make sense because that would make the coefficient a sum involving \\(c\\). But the problem is just asking for a numerical coefficient. So, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Wait, no, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, in other words, in the entire product, all the terms that have \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by any power of \\(c\\) will have coefficients that are the product of the coefficients from each part. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), because substituting \\(c = 1\\) gives the sum of coefficients. Let me check that. If I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = (2)^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times 64, which is 384. Wait, but that seems high. Let me think again. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term in \\((a + b)^4\\), and when you multiply by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for various \\(k\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, that would mean that the coefficient is the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). As I calculated earlier, that sum is 64, so 6 times 64 is 384. Hmm, but let me verify that. Alternatively, maybe I should think of it as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) being 6, and the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is multiplied by this 6, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the entire expansion, but that can't be right because the expansion includes different powers of \\(c\\). Wait, perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, so it's 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, maybe I'm wrong. Let me try another approach. Let's consider that the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When you expand this, each term will be of the form \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}a^{4 - k}b^k \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - m}(1/c)^m\\), which simplifies to \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}\\dbinom{6}{m} a^{4 - k}b^k c^{6 - 2m}\\). Now, we're interested in the terms where \\(a^2b^2\\), so \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). So, for \\(k = 2\\), we have \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Now, for each such term, we have to consider all possible \\(m\\) from 0 to 6, because each \\(m\\) will contribute a term with \\(c^{6 - 2m}\\). But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), that means we need to sum over all \\(m\\) the coefficients of \\(a^2b^2c^{6 - 2m}\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the sum over \\(m\\) from 0 to 6 of \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\dbinom{6}{m}\\). Wait, that's not quite right. Because for each \\(m\\), the term is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\dbinom{6}{m} a^2b^2 c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} \\times \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m}\\). But \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 384. But wait, that seems too straightforward. Let me check if I'm missing something. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to ask for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, which would make more sense. But the problem doesn't specify that, so I have to assume it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) term. So, in that case, the answer would be 384. Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in interpreting the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, that would mean that the coefficient is indeed 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, if the problem had asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for a specific \\(k\\), then we would have to find the corresponding term. But as it stands, it's just \\(a^2b^2\\), so the answer is 384. So, I think that's the correct approach.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is found using the binomial coefficient \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). The entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). To find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, we sum the coefficients of all terms in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is \\(2^6 = 64\\). Multiplying these together gives \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\boxed{384}."

So, does that mean that the entire coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is just 6 multiplied by whatever the constant term is in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)? Wait, no, that doesn't sound right. Let me think again. When I multiply two expressions together, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression. So, \\((a + b)^4\\) has terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) has terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). Since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), that term in the product will come from the product of the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in \\((a + b)^4\\) and the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because any other term involving \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\) would make the term have \\(c\\) powers, which we don't want. So, first, I found that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. Now, I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let's use the binomial theorem again for this part. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying the exponents: \\(c^{6 - m} \\times c^{-m} = c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We want the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, because that's the constant term. So, set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Now, since the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first part is multiplied by the constant term in the second part, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Let me double-check to make sure I didn't make a mistake. So, for \\((a + b)^4\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) has a coefficient of 6, that's correct because \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). For \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the constant term is when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, which happens at \\(m = 3\\), so \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying them together gives 6 * 20 = 120. That seems right. I don't think I missed anything here.

Let me try to clarify. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because when you multiply, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).

But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), that term from \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and it's multiplied by whatever the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is. Wait, but actually, no. Because when you multiply two expressions together, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by every term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, that means we need to consider all possible terms in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) and multiply them by \\(a^2b^2\\), but the problem doesn't specify any condition on \\(c\\). Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me read the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, the expression is a product of two parts: \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When you multiply them together, each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part will be multiplied by every term in the second part. But the question is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, but \\(a^2b^2\\) is only in the first part. The second part involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, when we multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by terms involving \\(c\\), the resulting terms will have \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by various powers of \\(c\\). But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so perhaps it's just the coefficient from the first part, because the second part is being multiplied by it. Wait, no, that doesn't make sense because when you multiply two expressions, the coefficients multiply as well. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion, which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a specific coefficient, not an expression. So, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some \\(k\\), but it's not specified. Wait, no, the problem just says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\". Hmm. Alternatively, maybe the problem is considering the entire product and wants the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, in that case, the coefficient would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, the coefficients add up. So, the total coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, the sum of the coefficients in a polynomial is found by setting all variables to 1. So, if I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = (2)^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of the coefficients is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 * 64 = 384. But wait, that seems high. Let me check that again. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and the second part is separate. But that doesn't make sense because the problem includes both parts. Wait, perhaps I'm misinterpreting the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, the expression is a product of two polynomials: one in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the other in \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). When you multiply them, the variables are independent, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient from the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), times the entire second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. So, perhaps the problem is only considering the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, not a number. Alternatively, maybe the problem is considering the term \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by any term from the second expansion, but that would still result in a term involving \\(c\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems odd because the problem is likely expecting a numerical answer. Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Maybe the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where \\(c\\) cancels out, i.e., \\(c^0\\). That would make sense because then we're looking for the term where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel each other out. So, let me try that approach. So, in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), I need to find the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0. Because then, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), the term will be \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is just \\(a^2b^2\\). So, let's find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We want the exponent of \\(c\\) to be 0, so we set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part is 20. Now, going back to the original expression, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Since these are independent, when we multiply the two expressions, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) (which is just \\(a^2b^2\\)) is the product of these two coefficients, which is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). So, the coefficient is 120.\n\nWait, but let me double-check that. So, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). In \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term where \\(c\\) cancels out is when \\(k = 3\\), which gives \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, when you multiply these two parts together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by the constant term 20 from the second part, resulting in \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\) as the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\). That makes sense. I think that's the correct answer.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let me consider if there's another interpretation. Suppose the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, meaning that the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. Therefore, the correct interpretation must be that we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nSo, to summarize:\n\n1. Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is 6.\n2. Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\), which is 20.\n3. Multiply these two coefficients together to get the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, which is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break down the problem into two parts:\n\n1. **Find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\):**\n   Using the binomial theorem, the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is:\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\), so the coefficient is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\n   \\]\n\n2. **Find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   Using the binomial theorem, the expansion is:\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n   \\]\n   We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so:\n   \\[\n   6 - 2k = 0 \\implies k = 3\n   \\]\n   The coefficient is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\n   \\]\n\n3. **Multiply the two coefficients:**\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the two coefficients:\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 20 = 120\n   \\]\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}."

Wait, but that seems too straightforward. Let me make sure I'm not missing something. Maybe I'm supposed to consider the entire expression and see if any cross terms affect \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, no, because \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\). So, when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which comes from the first part, the second part can be any term from the \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) expansion. So, actually, the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the sum of all terms in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that can't be right because that would make the coefficient depend on the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is a large number. Wait, no, that's not correct because the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, maybe the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems too big. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which would mean considering all possible combinations where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any term from the second expansion. Wait, but in that case, the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Hmm, but that might not be the case because the problem might just want the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. Wait, let me read the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, considering all terms. But \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term in the first part, and when multiplied by any term from the second part, which is a function of \\(c\\), the product will have terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some \\(k\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would include all possible \\(k\\), because \\(a^2b^2\\) can be multiplied by any term from the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because when you expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term is a coefficient times \\(c^k\\), and when you multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), you get \\(a^2b^2\\) times each of those terms. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. Now, the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), because that makes each term equal to its coefficient. So, substituting \\(c = 1\\), we get \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion is 64. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 times 64, which is 384. Wait, that seems correct. Let me verify. Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think again. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which comes from the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplied by the entire second expansion, which is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, when you multiply 6 by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, because each term in the second expansion is a coefficient times some power of \\(c\\), and when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), each term contributes to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times that coefficient. So, yes, the total coefficient would be 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, maybe the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which would mean that the coefficient is 6, but that seems unlikely because the problem includes the second part. Wait, perhaps I should think of it differently. Maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, which would mean that \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any term from the second expansion, so the coefficient would indeed be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. Let me check by expanding a bit more. Let's see: \\((a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. Now, when we multiply this by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^6 \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} (1/c)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^6 \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, each term in the second expansion is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). Therefore, when we multiply \\(6a^2b^2\\) by each of these terms, we get \\(6 \\dbinom{6}{k} a^2b^2 c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, in the product, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the sum over all \\(k\\) from 0 to 6 of \\(6 \\dbinom{6}{k}\\). But wait, that would mean the coefficient is 6 times the sum of \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}\\) for \\(k = 0\\) to 6, which is 6 * 2^6 = 6 * 64 = 384, as I thought earlier. So, yes, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 384. Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think again: the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient in the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Because when you multiply by any term from the second part, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term is present, and its coefficient is multiplied by each term's coefficient from the second expansion. Therefore, the total coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384. So, I think that's the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplying it by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 64. Therefore, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n\\(\\boxed{384}\\)"

Wait, is that correct? Let me think. Actually, when you multiply two expressions together, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression.

But that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the entire expression, which doesn't make sense because coefficients are numbers, not expressions. So, perhaps I'm making a mistake here. Let me try another approach. Let's consider that the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first part, and when multiplied by the second part, each term in the second part will have some power of \\(c\\), but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), the coefficient will be the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the sum of the coefficients from the second part. So, the sum of coefficients in the second part is indeed 64, as calculated earlier. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 * 64 = 384. Wait, but let me verify this with a different method. Alternatively, I can expand both parts separately and then multiply, but that would be time-consuming. Alternatively, I can think of the entire expression as a product of two polynomials, and when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term is the sum of the products of the coefficients of terms whose exponents add up to that term. But in this case, since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) don't interact with the exponents of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial. Because each term in the second polynomial is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), contributing to the coefficient. So, yes, that makes sense. Therefore, the coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384. Wait, but let me check the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) again. When \\(c = 1\\), it's (1 + 1)^6 = 64, which is correct. So, the sum of coefficients is 64, and the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6, so 6 * 64 = 384. Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe I should think of it as the entire expression being the product, and the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is present in the first part, and when multiplied by the second part, each term in the second part adds a coefficient to the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which is 64, giving 384. Yeah, that seems right. So, the final answer should be 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is found by first determining the coefficient from the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplying it by the sum of all coefficients in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 64. Therefore, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{384}\n\\]"

But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, does that mean I just need to consider the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, and that's it? Wait, maybe not. Let me think again. Wait, no, because when you multiply two expressions together, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression. So, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product. So, that means the coefficient is the same as the coefficient from the first part, because the \\(c\\) terms don't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) exponents. Wait, no, that's not correct. Wait, actually, no, because when you multiply, each term in the product will be a product of a term from \\((a + b)^4\\) and a term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, which are in terms of \\(c\\). But the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, in other words, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product will be the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), because each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is a separate term, and when you multiply, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will just be multiplied by each of those \\(c\\) terms, but the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) will be the same as in the first part, because the second part is just adding more terms with different powers of \\(c\\). Wait, but that doesn't seem right. Let me think again. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). And \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) expands to some terms with powers of \\(c\\). When I multiply them together, each term from the first expansion gets multiplied by each term from the second expansion. So, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But when we talk about the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, we're looking for all the terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) appears, which would be \\(6a^2b^2 \\times\\) each term in the second expansion. But the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so that would mean we're considering the coefficient regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. Wait, but that's not the case. Because each multiplication would produce terms like \\(6a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(6a^2b^2c^4\\), etc., but the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would actually be the sum of all the coefficients from the second expansion, because each term in the second expansion is multiplied by \\(6a^2b^2\\). Wait, no, that's not correct either. Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think differently. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). That means we're looking for all the terms in the product where \\(a\\) is squared and \\(b\\) is squared, regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient would be the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because each term in the second expansion contributes a coefficient that multiplies the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. Wait, but that's not exactly right either. Wait, no, actually, when you multiply two expressions, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each expression. But in this case, we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, that would mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that's not correct because each term in the second expression is multiplied by each term in the first, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expression times the sum of all coefficients in the second expression. But wait, the sum of all coefficients in the second expression is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), right? Because when \\(c = 1\\), each term becomes just its coefficient. So, \\(\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of all coefficients in the second expression is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 (from the first part) times 64 (sum of coefficients in the second part), which is 384. Wait, but that seems high. Let me check that again. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Perhaps the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which would mean that the \\(c\\) terms don't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) exponents. So, in that case, the coefficient would just be the coefficient from the first part, which is 6. But that doesn't seem right either because when you multiply two expressions, the coefficients do combine. Wait, perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, that would mean that each term in the product that has \\(a^2b^2\\) would have a coefficient equal to the product of the coefficients from each part. But since the second part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which expands to terms with various powers of \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would actually be 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second expression, which is 64, as I thought earlier. So, 6 times 64 is 384. Therefore, the coefficient is 384. But let me double-check that reasoning. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without considering the \\(c\\) terms, meaning that we treat \\(c\\) as a separate variable, and the coefficient is just 6. But that doesn't seem to align with the problem statement, which is written as \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), which would mean that we have to consider all possible terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present, each multiplied by some power of \\(c\\). But in that case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually be 6 multiplied by each coefficient from the second expression, but since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient from the first part, which is 6. Wait, but that seems contradictory. Let me try to think differently. Maybe the problem is written as \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), and we're supposed to consider all the terms, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the same as in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, because the other part doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) exponents. So, perhaps the answer is 6. But I'm confused because earlier I thought it might be 384, but now I'm thinking maybe it's just 6. Let me check with an example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, expanding, \\((a + b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2\\), and \\((c + 1/c)^1 = c + 1/c\\). Multiplying them together, we get \\(a^2c + a^2(1/c) + 2abc + 2ab(1/c) + b^2c + b^2(1/c)\\). Now, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in this product is zero because none of the terms have both \\(a^2\\) and \\(b^2\\) together. Wait, that's different. So, in this case, the coefficient is zero. But according to my earlier reasoning, if I took the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^2\\), which is 1 (for \\(a^2\\)) and 1 (for \\(b^2\\)), but in reality, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is zero because you can't have both \\(a^2\\) and \\(b^2\\) in the same term unless you have a term like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), but in the product above, you don't get \\(a^2b^2\\) because you have to choose either \\(a^2\\) or \\(b^2\\) from the first part and multiply by either \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\) from the second part. So, in that case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is zero. Hmm, so that suggests that my earlier reasoning was wrong. So, perhaps the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is actually zero because you can't have both \\(a^2\\) and \\(b^2\\) in the same term unless you have some cross terms, but in reality, each term in the product is a combination of a term from the first expansion and a term from the second. So, in the first expansion, the only term with both \\(a^2\\) and \\(b^2\\) is \\(6a^2b^2\\), but when you multiply it by the second expansion, each term will have \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by some power of \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which would mean the coefficient regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. Wait, but in the smaller example I did, where the second expansion was \\((c + 1/c)^1\\), the sum of coefficients is 2, so 1 (from \\(a^2\\)) times 2 would be 2, but in reality, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^0\\) is 2, but the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is zero because there's no \\(b^2\\) term in the first expansion. Wait, no, in that case, the first expansion is \\((a + b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2\\), so if I'm looking for \\(a^2b^2\\), that term doesn't exist. So, perhaps in the original problem, the coefficient is 6 times the sum of coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which would mean that the coefficient is 6, but that seems inconsistent with the smaller example. Wait, in the smaller example, \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is zero because there's no such term. So, perhaps in the original problem, the coefficient is zero. Wait, no, because in the original problem, \\((a + b)^4\\) does have an \\(a^2b^2\\) term, so when multiplied by the second expansion, it will produce terms like \\(6a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(6a^2b^2c^4\\), etc., but the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, so that would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. Wait, but in the smaller example, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is zero because you can't have both \\(a^2\\) and \\(b^2\\) in the same term when you're only multiplying by a linear term in \\(c\\). But in the original problem, you can have \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by various \\(c\\) terms, but the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the sum of all those coefficients, which would be 6 times 64, so 384. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without considering the \\(c\\) terms, which would mean that the coefficient is just 6. But I'm getting confused here. Let me try another approach. Let's consider that the product is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When we expand this, each term in the expansion will be of the form \\( \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k \\times \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\times c^{-m} \\), which simplifies to \\( \\dbinom{4}{k} \\dbinom{6}{m} a^{4 - k}b^k c^{6 - 2m} \\). Now, we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so we set \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). That gives us \\(k = 2\\). Now, regardless of the power of \\(c\\), which is \\(6 - 2m\\), the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) will be the sum over all possible \\(m\\) of \\( \\dbinom{4}{2} \\dbinom{6}{m} \\). Wait, but that's not quite right. Because for each \\(m\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^{6 - 2m}\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is actually the sum over all \\(m\\) of \\( \\dbinom{4}{2} \\dbinom{6}{m} \\). Wait, no, because \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\) is the coefficient for each term in the second expansion, so when you multiply, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the sum of all coefficients in the second part. But the sum of all coefficients in the second part is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), so \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). So, I think that's the correct answer. Therefore, the coefficient is 384.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. Let me consider the general case: when you have two polynomials multiplied together, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each polynomial. But in this case, we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, that would mean that for each term in the second polynomial, we have a coefficient, and when multiplied by the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first polynomial, each of those products contributes to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. Therefore, the total coefficient would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial. The sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial is indeed 64, as calculated earlier. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 * 64 = 384. So, I think that's correct.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n\\boxed{384}"

But wait, no, that doesn't make sense because the entire expression is the product of the two expansions. But the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would come from multiplying the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in \\((a + b)^4\\) by the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, is that correct? Because when you multiply two expressions, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, if I'm looking for a term that's just \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms, then I need to multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term by the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because if I multiply by any other term involving \\(c\\), the resulting term would have \\(c\\) in it, which we don't want. So, yes, I think that's right.

So, first, let me confirm that. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, as I found earlier. Now, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me think about that. The expression \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) can be expanded using the binomial theorem as well. So, each term would be \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k\\). Simplifying that, it becomes \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k - k} = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, I need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be 0, which means \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Let me calculate that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Now, since the original expression is the product of \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from multiplying the \\(a^2b^2\\) term (with coefficient 6) by the constant term (with coefficient 20). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 multiplied by 20, which is 120. Wait, but let me make sure I'm not missing anything. Is there any other term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) that could contribute to the constant term when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\)? No, because \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term without any \\(c\\) terms, so it can only be multiplied by the constant term in the other expansion to result in a term that's just \\(a^2b^2\\). If I multiplied it by a term with \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), the resulting term would have \\(c\\) in it, which wouldn't be \\(a^2b^2\\). So, I think I'm correct.

    "text": " Because \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\). So, when I multiply the two expressions together, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will come from the first part, and the second part will contribute a factor that's a polynomial in \\(c\\). But since the problem only asks for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I think that means I just need to consider the coefficient from the first part, and the second part will just be a scalar multiple, so it will multiply the coefficient. Wait, no, that's not right. Because actually, when you multiply two polynomials together, each term from the first polynomial gets multiplied by each term from the second polynomial. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), I think that the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the same as the coefficient in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, no, that can't be right because when you multiply, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) gets multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), the only way it can appear in the product is if we multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part by a term that is \\(c^0\\), i.e., a constant term from the second part. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by the constant term, you get \\(a^2b^2\\) times that constant, which is the only way to get an \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the product. So, I need to find two things: 1) the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which I already found as 6, and 2) the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me work on the second part now. So, expanding \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Again, using the binomial theorem: \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). I need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, because that's the constant term. So, I need to solve \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Let's solve for \\(m\\): \\(6 - 2m = 0\\) \u2192 \\(2m = 6\\) \u2192 \\(m = 3\\). So, the term where \\(m = 3\\) is the constant term. The coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Let me calculate that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Now, going back to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the two coefficients I found: 6 (from \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\)) multiplied by 20 (from the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)). So, 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient is 120. Let me just double-check that I didn't make a mistake in my calculations. For \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). For \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the constant term occurs at \\(m = 3\\), and \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).

    "text": " Because \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\). So, when I multiply the two expressions, the coefficients will multiply, but the variables will remain separate. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would just be 6 multiplied by whatever the coefficient is in the second part, but since we're only looking for \\(a^2b^2\\), the \\(c\\) terms don't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. Wait, is that correct? Let me think again. Actually, when you multiply two expressions, each term from the first expression gets multiplied by each term from the second expression. But since the variables are different (\\(a, b\\) vs \\(c, 1/c\\)), the cross terms won't affect each other. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire second part, because the second part doesn't have any \\(a\\) or \\(b\\) terms. Wait, that might not be right. Let me clarify. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when you expand this, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, for example, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by every term from the second part, but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), the only way this product would contribute to \\(a^2b^2\\) is if the second part is multiplied by 1, which doesn't change the term. But that doesn't make sense because the second part is a separate expression. Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again. Since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are different variables, the terms in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are independent of the terms in \\(c\\). So, when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the \\(c\\) terms in the second expansion will affect other terms, but for \\(a^2b^2\\), we can treat the second part as a constant because it doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\). Wait, no, that's not correct either because the second part is also being multiplied. So, actually, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which can be written as \\(\\left[(a + b)^4\\right] \\times \\left[(c + 1/c)^6\\right]\\). So, when you expand this, each term from \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term from \\((c + 1/c)^6\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), the only way this happens is if the term from \\((c + 1/c)^6\\) is 1, because otherwise, the term would involve \\(c\\) and thus not contribute to \\(a^2b^2\\). But wait, that doesn't make sense because \\((c + 1/c)^6\\) expands to terms involving \\(c^6\\), \\(c^4\\), \\(c^2\\), \\(1\\), \\(1/c^2\\), etc. So, the only term in \\((c + 1/c)^6\\) that doesn't involve \\(c\\) is the constant term, which is when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. So, the constant term in \\((c + 1/c)^6\\) is the middle term, which would be when the exponents of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) are equal. Let me find that. Using the binomial theorem again, \\((c + 1/c)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(1/c\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We want the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which gives \\(m = 3\\). So, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} c^{0} = 20\\). Therefore, the coefficient of the constant term is 20. So, going back to the original expression, when we multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\((c + 1/c)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by the constant term 20 from the second part. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the second part), which is 6 * 20 = 120. Wait, but let me double-check that. So, \\((a + b)^4\\) gives \\(a^2b^2\\) with coefficient 6, and \\((c + 1/c)^6\\) gives a constant term 20. So, when multiplied together, the coefficient becomes 6 * 20 = 120. That seems right. Alternatively, I could think of the entire expression as the product of two independent expansions, so the coefficients multiply for the terms that don't interfere with each other's variables. So, yes, I think 120 is the correct coefficient.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Multiplying these gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\(\\boxed{120}\\)"

Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, perhaps the problem is treating \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) as separate variables, and we're looking for the term where \\(a\\) is squared, \\(b\\) is squared, and \\(c\\) is raised to some power, but the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) exponent.

Wait, but the way the problem is phrased, it's just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so maybe it's considering the entire expression as a polynomial in \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\), and we're just looking for the coefficient of the term where \\(a\\) is squared and \\(b\\) is squared, regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, that can't be right because the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) would be when \\(c = 1\\), which is \\(2^6 = 64\\). So, the coefficient would be 6 * 64 = 384. But that seems too large. Let me think again. Alternatively, maybe the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, meaning that the \\(c\\) part is just a red herring, and the coefficient is just 6. But that doesn't seem right because the problem includes the \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) part, so perhaps I need to consider that. Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Let me try to approach it differently. The expression is \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so that would be the term where \\(a\\) is squared and \\(b\\) is squared, multiplied by any power of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all the coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because when you multiply, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), so the \\(a^2b^2\\) term would be multiplied by every term in the second expansion, each contributing a different power of \\(c\\). But the problem is only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The sum of the coefficients in a polynomial is found by plugging in 1 for all variables. So, in this case, the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) would be when \\(c = 1\\), which is \\(\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 * 64 = 384. Wait, but that seems high. Let me check again. Alternatively, maybe I'm supposed to consider that the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), so the coefficient would be 6 times each term in that expansion. But that would mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is actually a polynomial in \\(c\\), but the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would be a number, so perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Wait, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, so the coefficient would include the terms from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that would make the coefficient dependent on \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because coefficients are constants. Hmm, I'm confused now. Let me try to clarify: When you have a product of two polynomials, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\), and it's multiplied by every term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean that the coefficient is not a single number but a polynomial in \\(c\\), which contradicts the problem's wording, which asks for \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", implying a numerical coefficient. Therefore, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when considering the entire expression as a polynomial in \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\), but only the coefficient, not the entire term. So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean that the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which again doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only considering the term \\(a^2b^2\\) and wants the coefficient regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, meaning that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384. But I'm not sure. Let me try another approach. Maybe I should expand both expressions separately and then find the coefficient. So, first, \\((a + b)^4\\) expanded is \\(a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. Now, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) can be expanded using the binomial theorem as \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, each term in this expansion is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\) for \\(k = 0\\) to \\(6\\). Now, when we multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first expansion (which is 6a^2b^2) is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in the second expansion. Because each term in the second expansion has a coefficient, and when multiplied by 6a^2b^2, it would contribute 6 times that coefficient to the term \\(a^2b^2c^{6 - 2k}\\). But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), we need to sum all those contributions. So, the total coefficient would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion. The sum of the coefficients in the second expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\(\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the total coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384. Wait, that seems high, but I think that's correct. Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it, and the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which would be the product of the coefficients from each part, but that doesn't make sense because the second part is an expansion. Let me think again. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The entire second part \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is a polynomial in \\(c\\). When you multiply 6a^2b^2 by this polynomial, you get terms like 6a^2b^2c^6, 6a^2b^2c^4, etc., each with their own coefficients. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would include all the coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by 6. So, the coefficient is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 384.\n\nWait, but I'm not entirely sure. Let me check with an example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^1 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, \\((a + b)(c + 1/c)\\). The coefficient of \\(a^1b^0\\) would be 1 times (c + 1/c), so the coefficient would be 1*(1 + 1) = 2 if we set c=1. Similarly, the coefficient of \\(a^0b^1\\) would also be 2. But in reality, the expansion is \\(ac + a/c + bc + b/c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a\\) is \\(c + 1/c\\), which isn't a constant. So, perhaps the problem is expecting the coefficient to be a polynomial in \\(c\\), but the problem statement says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", which implies a numerical coefficient. Therefore, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the entire expression as a polynomial in \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\), and the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem says \"the coefficient\", which is usually a scalar, so perhaps I need to re-express the problem differently.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, so the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem didn't specify that, so perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Alternatively, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, meaning that it's 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. That seems plausible.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is only considering the term \\(a^2b^2\\) and wants the coefficient without any \\(c\\) terms, but that would require the \\(c\\) exponent to be zero. So, in that case, we would need to find the term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, i.e., \\(c^0\\), and then multiply that by 6. So, let's find the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial expansion, the exponent of \\(c\\) in each term is \\(6 - 2k\\), where \\(k\\) is from 0 to 6. So, we set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\). So, the term where \\(k=3\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} c^{0} = 20\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) would be 6 * 20 = 120. So, that's another approach. But which one is correct?\n\nWait, the problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\". If it's considering the entire expression, including \\(c\\), then the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\), but if it's only considering the coefficient regardless of \\(c\\), then perhaps it's 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 384. But if it's considering only the term where \\(c\\) is to the zero power, then it's 120. I'm confused now.\n\nWait, let me check the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" It doesn't specify any condition on \\(c\\), so perhaps it's expecting the coefficient as a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem is phrased as \"the coefficient\", which usually refers to a scalar. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is treating the entire expression as a polynomial in \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\), and the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which would be 6 times the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems unlikely because coefficients are typically constants.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when considering the expression as a product, so the coefficient would be 6 times each term in the second expansion, but that would make the coefficient a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem didn't specify that, so perhaps it's expecting the coefficient to be a number, implying that \\(c\\) is being treated as a variable independent of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the coefficient is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6*64=384.\n\nBut earlier, when I considered that the exponent of \\(c\\) has to be zero, I got 120. Let me think: if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), then it's 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6*64=384. If it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it's 6*20=120. But the problem didn't specify, so perhaps I need to assume that it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), which would be 384.\n\nWait, but in the initial approach, I thought that the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6*64=384. Alternatively, if the problem is expecting a single number, then 384 is the answer. But I'm not entirely sure. Let me try to see if that makes sense.\n\nWait, let me think of it differently: when you have two polynomials multiplied together, the coefficient of a specific term in one polynomial is multiplied by all the terms in the other polynomial. So, in this case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial is 6, and when you multiply by the second polynomial, each term in the second polynomial adds to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. So, the total coefficient would be 6 times each term in the second polynomial, but that would make the coefficient a polynomial in \\(c\\). Therefore, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), it's 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 6*64=384.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it's 6*20=120. But since the problem didn't specify \\(c\\), perhaps it's 384.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is only considering \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the \\(c\\) terms are just part of the expression, so the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of the second polynomial, but that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, which doesn't make sense. Therefore, I think the correct interpretation is that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), so it's 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 6*64=384.\n\nWait, but I just thought of another approach. Maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where \\(a\\) is squared, \\(b\\) is squared, and \\(c\\) is to the zero power. In that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 6*20=120. That seems more plausible because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and if it's considering the entire expression, it's likely that \\(c\\) is supposed to be eliminated or set to a specific power.\n\nWait, but the problem didn't specify anything about \\(c\\), so I'm not sure. Maybe I should look for a term where \\(c\\) is to the zero power. Let me check that. So, in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term where \\(c\\) is to the zero power is when the exponent is zero, which occurs at \\(k=3\\), as I found earlier. So, the coefficient is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) would be 6*20=120. So, perhaps the problem is expecting that answer.\n\nWait, but the problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", not \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). So, maybe it's expecting the coefficient as a polynomial in \\(c\\), but that would be 6 times the entire expansion of the second polynomial, which would make the coefficient a polynomial, not a scalar. Therefore, perhaps the problem is expecting the coefficient to be a scalar, which would mean that it's considering the coefficient when \\(c\\) is set to 1, making the entire second polynomial equal to 64. Therefore, the coefficient would be 6*64=384.\n\nBut I'm not entirely sure. To clarify, let me consider an example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)(c + 1/c)\\). The coefficient of \\(a\\) would be \\(c + 1/c\\), which is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a\\) as a scalar, that doesn't make sense because it's a polynomial. Therefore, perhaps the problem is expecting the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), meaning that it's 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 6*64=384.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is only considering the term where \\(c\\) is to the zero power, making the coefficient 120. But without more context, it's hard to tell. However, given that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and not specifying anything about \\(c\\), I think the intended answer is 384. So, I'll go with that.\n\nWait, but I just realized that in the problem statement, it's \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, if I consider the entire expression, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is multiplied by every term in the second part, each contributing a different power of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6*64=384.\n\nYes, that makes sense because the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the sum of all the products of \\(a^2b^2\\) with each term in the second expansion, which is 6 times each coefficient in the second expansion. Therefore, the total coefficient is 6*64=384.\n\nSo, after all that, I think the coefficient is 384.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was 120 when considering \\(c^0\\). I'm confused again. Let me think: If the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then it's 384. If it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), it's 120. Since the problem didn't specify, I think it's more likely that it's asking for the coefficient regardless of \\(c\\), so 384. But I'm not entirely sure.\n\nWait, another way to think about it: The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. Since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), the coefficient would be the product of the coefficients from each part. But that's not correct because the second part is an expansion. So, the correct approach is that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6*64=384.\n\nTherefore, I'll conclude that the coefficient is 384.\n\nWait, but I just thought of another approach. Let me use multinomial coefficients or generating functions. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, as we found. Now, when we multiply by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in that expansion is a term in \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would mean that the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. Therefore, perhaps the problem is expecting the coefficient when \\(c\\) is set to 1, which would make \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = 64\\), so the coefficient is 6*64=384.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So, I think the answer is 384.\n\nWait, but in my earlier example, when I had \\((a + b)(c + 1/c)\\), the coefficient of \\(a\\) is \\(c + 1/c\\), which is a polynomial. So, in that case, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a\\), it's a polynomial. But in our problem, it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would be a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem didn't specify, so perhaps it's expecting the coefficient when \\(c\\) is 1, which would make it 384.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. But without more context, it's hard to tell. However, given that the problem didn't specify anything about \\(c\\), I think the intended answer is 384.\n\nWait, but I just realized that in the problem statement, it's \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the entire expression is a product of two separate polynomials. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient from the first polynomial times the entire second polynomial. So, the coefficient would be 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial, not a number. Therefore, perhaps the problem is expecting the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second polynomial, which is 6*20=120.\n\nYes, that makes more sense because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would be a term in the product where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2, and the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. So, the coefficient is 6*20=120.\n\nWait, but the problem didn't specify the exponent of \\(c\\), so I'm not sure. But considering that, perhaps the intended answer is 120.\n\nWait, let me check with \\(k=3\\) in the second expansion: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\), so the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is 6*20=120. So, if the problem is asking for that, the answer is 120.\n\nBut the problem didn't specify \\(c\\), so perhaps it's expecting the coefficient as a polynomial, but that doesn't make sense. Therefore, I think the problem is expecting the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nWait, but I'm not sure. Let me think again: If I have \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), and I want the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\), then it's 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6*64=384. But if I want the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), it's 6*20=120.\n\nGiven that the problem didn't specify anything about \\(c\\), I think it's more likely that it's expecting 120, because otherwise, the coefficient would be a polynomial, which isn't typical unless specified. Therefore, I think the answer is 120.\n\nWait, but I'm still confused. Let me try to look for similar problems. Usually, when a problem asks for the coefficient of a term in a product of two polynomials, it's considering the term where the variables in that term are specified, and any other variables are set to a specific value, often zero or one, to eliminate them. But in this case, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), without specifying anything about \\(c\\). So, perhaps the intended answer is 120, considering that \\(c\\) must be to the zero power to have a term in \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, I think the answer is 120.\n\nWait, but I'm still not sure. Let me try to think differently. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would come from multiplying \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part by each term in the second part. So, the coefficient would be 6 times each coefficient in the second expansion, but that would make the coefficient a polynomial in \\(c\\). Therefore, unless the problem specifies a particular power of \\(c\\), the coefficient is a polynomial. But since the problem didn't specify, perhaps it's expecting the coefficient as a polynomial, but that seems unlikely.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting the coefficient when all variables are set to 1, which would make the entire expression equal to \\((1 + 1)^4 \\times (1 + 1)^6 = 16 \\times 64 = 1024\\). But that's the sum of all coefficients, not just \\(a^2b^2\\). So, that approach doesn't help.\n\nWait, perhaps I should use generating functions. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the coefficient of \\(c^k\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) for any \\(k\\). But that doesn't make sense because the coefficient would be a sum over all \\(k\\).\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is expecting the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), so it's 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6*64=384.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nI think I need to make a decision. Given that the problem didn't specify anything about \\(c\\), I think the intended answer is 120, considering that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) where \\(c\\) is to the zero power is 120. Therefore, I'll go with 120 as the answer.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought 384 was the answer. I'm really confused now. Let me try to think of it as a generating function. If I have \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), and I want the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), it's equivalent to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire generating function for \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient would be 6 times the generating function for \\(c\\), which is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would make the coefficient a polynomial in \\(c\\), which isn't a number. Therefore, perhaps the problem is expecting the coefficient when \\(c = 1\\), which is 6*64=384.\n\nYes, that makes sense because when \\(c = 1\\), \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = 64\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6*64=384.\n\nTherefore, I think the correct answer is 384.\n\nBut wait, I just realized that when you set \\(c = 1\\), you're effectively summing all the coefficients in the second expansion, which gives you the total contribution of the \\(a^2b^2\\) term across all powers of \\(c\\). So, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), then 384 is correct. If it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it's 120. Since the problem didn't specify, I think 384 is the intended answer.\n\nSo, after all that, I think the coefficient is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplying it by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The sum of the coefficients in the second expression is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), yielding \\(2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n$\\boxed{384}$"

Wait, but no, actually, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term is just one term, so when I multiply it by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, that doesn't make sense because the question is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term in the product.

Wait, that can't be right because the problem is expecting a numerical coefficient, not an expression involving \\(c\\). Hmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" Oh, wait, maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would just be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems odd because the problem is likely expecting a numerical coefficient, not an expression. Maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, but that would mean the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\). But perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), meaning the term where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out. Wait, that might make sense. Because \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) can have terms with various powers of \\(c\\), but if we're looking for the term where \\(c\\) cancels out (i.e., \\(c^0\\)), then that term would be the constant term, and when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), the entire coefficient would be 6 times the constant term of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, perhaps that's what the problem is asking for. Let me check that. So, first, I find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6. Then, I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because when I multiply the two expressions, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but only the constant term (i.e., the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero) will contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the overall product if we're considering it as a single term. Wait, but actually, the entire product would have terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for various \\(k\\), but the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would include all the terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any power of \\(c\\). But that doesn't make sense because then the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\), which isn't a numerical value. So, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by the constant term of the other expansion. That seems plausible. So, let me proceed under that assumption. So, first, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, as I found earlier. Now, I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). To find the constant term, I can use the binomial theorem again. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k\\). Simplifying each term, that becomes \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} c^{-k} = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). The constant term occurs when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20. Now, putting it all together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is the product of the two coefficients we found: 6 (from \\(a^2b^2\\)) and 20 (from the constant term). So, 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is 120.\n\nWait, let me double-check that. So, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). In \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the constant term is when the exponent is zero, which is at \\(k=3\\), giving \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, multiplying these together gives 6*20=120. That seems correct. Alternatively, if the problem was asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, then the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but that would be a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't seem right. So, I think the intended interpretation is that we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. Yeah, I think that's the answer.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Multiplying these gives 6 * 20 = 120.\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\boxed{120}."

But since we're only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and not any terms involving \\(c\\), does that mean the coefficient remains 6? Wait, that doesn't seem right because the entire expression is a product, so maybe the coefficients multiply as well. Wait, no, because \\(a^2b^2\\) is being multiplied by all the terms in the other expansion, but since we're just looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, the coefficient would just be 6 times whatever the coefficient is for the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, that makes sense because if I have \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by, say, the constant term from the other expansion, then that would be the only term contributing to \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms. So, I think I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me figure that out. Using the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying the exponents, that becomes \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the exponent on \\(c\\) is \\(6 - 2m\\). We need the term where the exponent is zero because that's the constant term. So, set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). So, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20. Therefore, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the constant term in the second part). So, 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient is 120. Wait, but let me double-check to make sure I didn't make a mistake. So, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Then, in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the constant term is when the exponent is zero, which occurs at \\(m = 3\\), so \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying these together gives 6 * 20 = 120. That seems correct. So, I think the coefficient is 120.\n\nWait, but hold on. Let me think again. The problem says the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). But in the entire expression, it's \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, when you multiply these two, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part, which includes terms with different powers of \\(c\\). But the question is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. Wait, but in that case, wouldn't the coefficient be 6 times the entire expansion of the second part? But that doesn't make sense because the second part has many terms, so the coefficient would be 6 times each term in the second expansion, but that would mean \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term, leading to terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), etc. But the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not considering \\(c\\). So, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Perhaps the question is only about the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, but without considering the \\(c\\) terms. So, in that case, the coefficient would just be 6, because when you multiply by the second expansion, all the \\(c\\) terms are separate. But that contradicts my earlier thought where I considered the constant term. Wait, no, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, it's possible that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. That is, in the entire expansion, collect all terms that have \\(a^2b^2\\), and sum their coefficients, regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). But that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which would make the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) equal to 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't seem right because the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) would be when \\(c = 1\\), so substituting \\(c = 1\\), it becomes \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, 6 * 64 = 384. But that seems too high, and I don't think that's what the problem is asking. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, but without any \\(c\\) terms, meaning the term where \\(c\\) is raised to zero. So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 * 20 = 120, as I calculated earlier. But I'm a bit confused because the problem didn't specify whether to consider only the constant term or all terms. Let me think again. If the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, without any restrictions on \\(c\\), then it would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which would mean the coefficient is 6 times 64, which is 384. But that seems unlikely because that would be a very large coefficient. Alternatively, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), then it's 6 * 20 = 120. I think the latter makes more sense because the problem is likely asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by the constant term in the \\(c\\) expansion. So, I think 120 is the correct answer.\n\nWait, but let me check again. Let's consider the product \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). When you expand this, each term will be of the form \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}a^{4 - k}b^k \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would come from the term where \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\), so that's \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\), and then multiplied by \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\). But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), it would actually be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which would mean that the coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384. But that seems too big, and I think the problem is more likely asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when multiplied by the constant term in the \\(c\\) expansion. So, perhaps the correct approach is to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 20, and then multiply that by 6 to get 120. Alternatively, maybe the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, without considering the \\(c\\) terms, meaning that the coefficient is just 6, because the other part is multiplied by various \\(c\\) terms, but \\(a^2b^2\\) is just 6 times the entire expansion of the \\(c\\) terms. Hmm, I'm getting confused. Let me try to clarify. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. So, when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term is the sum of all products of coefficients from each polynomial that result in that term. In this case, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) can only come from the product of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial and any term in the second polynomial. So, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 6 * 64 = 384. But that doesn't seem right because that would mean the coefficient is 384, which is quite large. Alternatively, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), then it's 6 * 20 = 120. I think I need to consider the problem statement again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" It doesn't specify anything about \\(c\\), so it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of the second polynomial. But that would mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 * 64 = 384. But that seems too large, and I'm not sure if that's the correct interpretation. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when considering the product, but without any \\(c\\) terms, meaning that the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120. I think the intended interpretation is the latter, that the coefficient is 120, because otherwise, the problem would have mentioned something about considering the \\(c\\) terms. So, I think the correct answer is 120.\n\nWait, let me try to think differently. Suppose I expand both parts separately and then multiply them. The expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is \\(a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). The expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is \\(c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15/c^2 + 6/c^4 + 1/c^6\\). Now, when I multiply these two expansions, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product will be 6 times each term in the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) will be 6 times \\(c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15/c^2 + 6/c^4 + 1/c^6\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would mean that it's 6 times the entire expansion of the second polynomial. But that can't be right because the coefficient should be a single number, not a polynomial. Therefore, I must have misunderstood the problem. Wait, no, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times each coefficient in the second expansion, but that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, which doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, considering all possible terms, but that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. But that seems too high. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when multiplied by the constant term in the second expansion, which is 20. So, 6 * 20 = 120. I think that's the correct interpretation because otherwise, the problem would have been phrased differently, perhaps asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some \\(k\\). So, given that, I think the answer is 120.\n\nWait, let me confirm once more. If I have \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), and I need the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), then it's the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire second part. But the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times each term in the second expansion, but that would make the coefficient a polynomial, which doesn't make sense. Therefore, the problem must be asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when multiplied by the constant term in the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but let me think about it differently. If I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, then the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * (1 + 6 + 15 + 20 + 15 + 6 + 1) = 6 * 64 = 384. But that seems too large, and I don't think that's what the problem is asking. The problem is more likely asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when multiplied by the constant term in the second expansion, which is 20. So, 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient is 120.\n\nI think I've thought through this enough, and I'm convinced that the correct answer is 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem.\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\), so the coefficient is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\n   \\]\n\n2. **Find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n   \\]\n   The constant term occurs when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, i.e., \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which gives \\(m = 3\\).

Wait, no, that's not quite right. Let me think again. When you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first polynomial multiplies each term in the second polynomial. So, if I have \\((a + b)^4\\) times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part will be multiplied by every term in the second part. But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I don't need to consider how the \\(c\\) terms affect the exponent of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), because they don't.

Wait, no, that's not right either. Let me think again. Maybe I'm overcomplicating it. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product.

Wait, but that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times something, but that doesn't seem right because the second part is a separate expression. Maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, the entire expression is the product of two binomials: one with \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and another with \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). Since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are only in the first part, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will only come from the first part, and the second part will just contribute a factor that multiplies the entire term. But wait, the problem is asking for the coefficient, so actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't make sense because the second part is a separate variable, so when you multiply, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be 6 times whatever the sum of the coefficients in the second part is, but that's not correct because each term in the second part is multiplied by each term in the first part. Wait, no, that's not the case. Let me think differently. Maybe I'm supposed to consider that the entire expression is a product, and I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, in other words, the \\(c\\) terms don't affect the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the same as the coefficient in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, that might be it. Because when you multiply by the second expression, each term in the first expression is multiplied by each term in the second expression. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), we need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and then multiply it by the sum of the coefficients of all terms in the second part. Because each term in the second part will multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term, effectively scaling it by the coefficient of each term in the second part. So, the total coefficient would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But how do I find the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)? Well, the sum of the coefficients in a polynomial is found by setting all variables to 1. So, if I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = (1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of the coefficients in the second part is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 times 64, which is 384. Wait, but that seems high. Let me check again. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are only in the first part, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is just the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. But since the second part is a separate variable, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be 6 times the entire expansion, but that doesn't make sense because the expansion includes \\(c\\) terms. Wait, no, actually, when you multiply two expressions, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part will be multiplied by every term in the second part. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Because each term in the second part is a coefficient times some power of \\(c\\), but since we're only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient will be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second part. And as I calculated earlier, the sum of coefficients in the second part is 64 when \\(c = 1\\). So, 6 times 64 is 384. Therefore, the coefficient is 384. Wait, but let me think again. Alternatively, maybe I should consider that the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), when expanded, has terms like \\(c^6\\), \\(6c^4\\), \\(15c^2\\), \\(20\\), \\(15c^{-2}\\), \\(6c^{-4}\\), \\(c^{-6}\\). So, the coefficients are 1, 6, 15, 20, 15, 6, 1. The sum of these coefficients is 1 + 6 + 15 + 20 + 15 + 6 + 1 = 64, which matches what I had before. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 times 64, which is 384. Therefore, the answer is 384.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. Another way to think about it is that when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum of the products of the coefficients of terms whose exponents add up to that term. But in this case, since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the exponents of \\(c\\) in the second part can be anything, but they don't affect the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. But that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second part, which is 6 times 64, which is 384. So, I think that's correct. Alternatively, maybe I can think of it as the coefficient being 6 times each coefficient in the second part, but that's not the case because each term in the second part would multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term, so the coefficient would be 6 times each coefficient, but since we're just looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), it's 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second part. So, yes, 6 times 64 is 384. So, I think the answer is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\(2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n\\(\\boxed{384}\\)"

So, maybe the coefficient I'm looking for is just 6 times whatever the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because when you multiply, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part will multiply the constant term (i.e., \\(c^0\\)) from the second part, giving me an \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the product. So, I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me think about that. Again, using the binomial theorem, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\).

Therefore, the coefficient would be 6 times 64, which is 384. But wait, that seems too straightforward, and I'm not sure if that's correct. Let me check again. Alternatively, maybe I should consider that when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but that's not quite right because each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is multiplied by each term in \\((a + b)^4\\).

Maybe I'm supposed to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without considering the \\(c\\) terms, but that doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for the coefficient in the entire product, which includes the \\(c\\) terms.

So, I think my initial approach is correct. Therefore, the coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but I just realized that maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me try a different approach. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). To find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I can consider that the \\(a^2b^2\\) term comes only from the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\), and it's multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). As before, the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\(2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because I'm not sure if the problem wants the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), or if it's asking for the coefficient in the entire expansion, including the \\(c\\) terms. But the way the problem is phrased, it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, so that would include all possible powers of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should think of it as the product of two independent expansions. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is a polynomial in \\(c\\), so when you multiply, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but another way to think about it is that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is just the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), because each term in the second expansion will be multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nI think that makes sense. So, the coefficient is 384.\n\nBut let me double-check by expanding \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) and see what the sum of the coefficients is. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\cdot (1/c)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). The sum of the coefficients is when \\(c = 1\\), so it's \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} = 2^6 = 64\\). So, yes, the sum is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit unsure because sometimes when you have variables like \\(c\\), you might have to consider if the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by a specific power of \\(c\\), but the problem doesn't specify any particular power of \\(c\\), just \\(a^2b^2\\). So, I think the answer is 384.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Maybe I'm supposed to consider that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just 6, and the rest is multiplied by the second part. But no, because when you multiply by the second part, each term in the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would indeed be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second part, which is 64, so 384.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which would be 6, but that doesn't seem right because the entire expression is a product, so the coefficient should account for the second part as well.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Let me try a different approach. Let me consider the entire expression as a product of two polynomials. The first polynomial is \\((a + b)^4\\), and the second is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). When you multiply them, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial times the sum of all the coefficients in the second polynomial. Because each term in the second polynomial contributes its coefficient when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the sum of the coefficients in the second polynomial is 64, as calculated before. Therefore, the coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me think about it another way. Suppose I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = (1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, the entire expression becomes \\((a + b)^4 * 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 * 64 = 384, which matches what I thought earlier.\n\nAlternatively, if I didn't set \\(c = 1\\), but instead considered that each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient from the first part times the entire expansion of the second part. But since the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), it's 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second part, which is 64, so 384.\n\nI think that's correct. So, the coefficient is 384.\n\nWait, but I'm going to check one more time. Let's say I expand \\((a + b)^4\\) as \\(a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. Now, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is a polynomial in \\(c\\), and when I multiply it by \\(6a^2b^2\\), I get \\(6a^2b^2 \\times \\left(c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15/c^2 + 6/c^4 + 1/c^6\\right)\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each of these terms, resulting in \\(6a^2b^2c^6 + 36a^2b^2c^4 + 90a^2b^2c^2 + 120a^2b^2 + 90a^2b^2/c^2 + 36a^2b^2/c^4 + 6a^2b^2/c^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the sum of the coefficients from each of these terms, which is 6 + 36 + 90 + 120 + 90 + 36 + 6. Let me add these up:\n\n6 + 36 = 42\n\n42 + 90 = 132\n\n132 + 120 = 252\n\n252 + 90 = 342\n\n342 + 36 = 378\n\n378 + 6 = 384.\n\nSo, that confirms it. The coefficient is indeed 384.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 384.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{384}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem.\n\nFirst, we expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n\\]\nThe term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\), so the coefficient is:\n\\[\n\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\n\\]\n\nNext, we consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The sum of the coefficients in this expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\):\n\\[\n\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\n\\]\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is the product of the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) and the sum of the coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):\n\\[\n6 \\times 64 = 384\n\\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{384}\\)."

But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), maybe I can just take the coefficient from the \\((a + b)^4\\) part and multiply it by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but since we're only interested in the coefficient, perhaps it's just 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion? Wait, no, that doesn't make sense because each term in the second expansion will multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term, but the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so maybe the coefficient is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion? Wait, no, that might not be right. Let me think again. When you multiply two expressions, the coefficients multiply. But in this case, since we're looking for a specific term in the product, maybe I can consider that the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part. But since the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then perhaps the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. But that doesn't seem right either because each term in the second expansion is a different power of \\(c\\), so when you multiply, the coefficients add up, but the variables are separate. Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try to break it down differently. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the first part, and when multiplied by the second part, which is a polynomial in \\(c\\), it will create terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for various exponents \\(k\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). Wait, but that's not possible because each term in the expansion will have both \\(a^2b^2\\) and some power of \\(c\\). So, maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by any power of \\(c\\), but I don't think that's the case. Wait, perhaps the problem is actually written as \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), and we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, which would include all possible powers of \\(c\\). But that seems odd because \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term that's separate from \\(c\\). Wait, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, in that case, the coefficient would be the same as in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but the sum of the coefficients in a polynomial is found by setting the variable to 1. So, if I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of the coefficients in the second part is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 times 64, which is 384. But wait, is that correct? Let me double-check. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\) with coefficient 6, and when multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which has terms like \\(c^6\\), \\(6c^4\\), \\(15c^2\\), \\(20\\), \\(15c^{-2}\\), \\(6c^{-4}\\), \\(c^{-6}\\). So, each of these terms will multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term, resulting in \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(6a^2b^2c^4\\), etc. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but in the entire expansion, \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by various powers of \\(c\\). So, if we're just looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then it's 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. But wait, that seems high. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), i.e., the constant term in \\(c\\). That would make more sense. So, perhaps I need to find the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me check that. So, the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. Using the binomial theorem, the general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We set the exponent equal to zero: \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, considering only the constant term in \\(c\\), would be 6 * 20 = 120. But the problem didn't specify anything about \\(c\\), just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, maybe it's expecting the sum over all possible \\(c\\) terms, which would be 6 * 64 = 384. But that seems a bit strange because \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term that is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, so the coefficient would actually be 6 times the entire second expansion, but that's not how coefficients work. Wait, no, when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in one polynomial is multiplied by each term in the other polynomial, but when considering the entire product, the coefficient of a specific term in one part is multiplied by each term in the other part, leading to multiple terms in the product. But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so maybe it's considering all possible exponents of \\(c\\). So, perhaps the coefficient is indeed 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, maybe the problem is written incorrectly, and it's supposed to be \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), and we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be 6 * 20 = 120. I'm a bit confused now. Let me see the original problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, it's just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, because each term in the second expansion will multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term, effectively scaling it by the coefficients in the second expansion. Therefore, the total coefficient would be 6 * 64 = 384. But let me think again: when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial, leading to multiple terms in the product. But if you're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, then it's as if you're summing over all possible coefficients from the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion. Since the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\(2^6 = 64\\), then the coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, if the problem had asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it would be 6 * 20 = 120. But since it's just \\(a^2b^2\\), I think it's 384. But I'm not entirely sure. Let me check with an example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^1 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, expanding, it's \\((a + b)(c + 1/c)\\). The coefficient of \\(a^1b^0\\) would be 1 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 1 + 1 = 2, so 1 * 2 = 2. Alternatively, if I look for the coefficient of \\(a^1b^0c^0\\), it would be 1 * 1 = 1. So, depending on whether the problem is asking for all powers of \\(c\\) or just the constant term, the answer changes. Since the original problem didn't specify, I think it's more likely that it's asking for the coefficient regardless of \\(c\\), so 384. But I'm still a bit unsure. Alternatively, maybe the problem is expecting me to consider that \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term independent of \\(c\\), so I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be 120. I think I need to clarify this. Let me look at the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" It's just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), without mentioning \\(c\\). So, in the context of polynomial multiplication, when you have multiple variables, the coefficient of a specific term in some variables is considered regardless of the other variables. So, in this case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the same as in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), meaning that the coefficient is 6 times each term in the second expansion, but when considering the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), it's actually the sum of all the coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by 6. Wait, no, that's not quite right. Because when you multiply, each term in the second expansion is a separate term, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times each coefficient in the second expansion, but that's not how coefficients work. Wait, no, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the entire second polynomial. But that doesn't make sense because the second polynomial has multiple terms. Actually, when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum of the products of the coefficients of terms whose variables multiply to give that specific term. But in this case, since \\(a^2b^2\\) is in the first polynomial and the second polynomial has terms in \\(c\\), which are separate variables, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the same as the coefficient in the first polynomial, because when you multiply by any term in the second polynomial, the coefficient gets multiplied by that term's coefficient, but since we're considering all possible terms, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second polynomial. Wait, no, that's not correct because each term in the second polynomial is a separate term, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times each coefficient in the second polynomial, but that's not how it works. Actually, when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial multiplied by the entire second polynomial. But that's not accurate either. Let me think differently. Let me consider that the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when you expand this, each term will be of the form \\(a^{4 - k}b^k \\times c^{6 - m}c^{-m} = a^{4 - k}b^k c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would come from \\(k = 2\\) in the first part, which we've already found to be 6. Now, for each term in the second part, which is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, when we multiply, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, resulting in terms like \\(6 \\times \\dbinom{6}{m} a^2b^2c^{6 - 2m}\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^{6 - 2m}\\) is \\(6 \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in the entire product, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the sum over all \\(m\\) of \\(6 \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}\\), which is 6 times the sum of \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\) for \\(m = 0\\) to \\(6\\). But the sum of \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\) from \\(m = 0\\) to \\(6\\) is \\(2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). So, that's the answer. Alternatively, if the problem had asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), we would have found that the constant term in the second expansion is 20, so the coefficient would be \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). But since it's just asking for \\(a^2b^2\\), the answer is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Then, since the problem doesn't specify any condition on \\(c\\), we consider the sum of all coefficients in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is \\(2^6 = 64\\). Multiplying these together gives \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{384}."

So, maybe I can just consider the part of the product where the \\(c\\) terms are multiplied by 1, so that they don't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. Hmm, but wait, no. Because when you multiply two expressions, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression. So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I need to consider all terms in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) that, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), result in a term that's just \\(a^2b^2\\). But that would only happen if the \\(c\\) terms multiply to 1, because \\(a^2b^2 \\times 1 = a^2b^2\\). So, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because \\(c^0 = 1\\), which would leave the \\(a^2b^2\\) term unchanged. So, let me find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).

But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, I think I need to find the sum of all coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because each term in that expansion will be multiplied by the \\(a^2b^2\\) term, contributing to the overall coefficient. Wait, no, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product will be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is a coefficient times some power of \\(c\\), and when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), it becomes a term like 6 * (coefficient) * \\(a^2b^2c^k\\). But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), I think that's correct. So, I need to find the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Alternatively, the sum of coefficients is found by setting \\(c = 1\\). So, if I substitute \\(c = 1\\) into \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), I get \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 64. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 * 64 = 384. Wait, is that right? Let me check again. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, I can think of it as the product of the coefficient from the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) part and the sum of all coefficients from the \\(c\\) part. So, 6 * 64 = 384. But let me think differently. Maybe I should consider that \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) can be expanded, and each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - k}\\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\\), where \\(k\\) goes from 0 to 6. Therefore, the sum of all coefficients is when we set \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} = 2^6 = 64\\), as I thought earlier. So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 * 64 = 384. Therefore, the final answer should be 384. But wait, let me make sure I'm not missing anything. The problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", which implies that we're considering terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any power of \\(c\\), so the coefficient is indeed 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the other part, which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. Yeah, that seems correct.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term with \\(a^2b^2\\) is when \\(k = 2\\):\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\n   \\]\n   So, the coefficient is 6.\n\n2. **Consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   Each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\\).\n\n3. **Sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   Substitute \\(c = 1\\):\n   \\[\n   (1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\n   \\]\n\n4. **Multiply the coefficients:**\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n**Answer:** \\(\\boxed{384}\\)"
