    "text": " So, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first part is multiplied by the constant term in the second part, resulting in \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\) as the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. Hmm, that seems correct. But wait, let me think again. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). When you expand this, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by all the terms from the second part. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), we need to find the terms in the second part that don't involve \\(c\\). That is, the constant term, which we found to be 20. So, the coefficient is indeed 6 times 20, which is 120. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in calculating the binomial coefficients. For \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\), which is 6, correct. For \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the expansion is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^6 \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), \\(m = 3\\), so the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\), which is 20, correct. So, 6 times 20 is 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120.\n\nWait, but hold on a second. Let me make sure I didn't misinterpret the problem. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, when I multiply these two, the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from those involving \\(c\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would come from the product of the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first part and the constant term in the second part. Therefore, the coefficient is indeed 6 times 20, which is 120.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of it as the product of two independent expansions. So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6, and the coefficient for \\(c^0\\) in the second part is 20, so when you multiply these two, you get 6*20=120. That seems correct.\n\nWait, but another way to think about it is that the entire expression is a product of two polynomials, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the sum over all possible products where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) add up to 2 each, but since the second polynomial doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), the only contribution comes from the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first polynomial multiplied by the constant term in the second. So, yes, 6*20=120.\n\nI think that makes sense. So, the final answer should be 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Multiplying these gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\boxed{120}"

But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term without \\(c\\), the only term in the second expansion that will contribute is the one without \\(c\\), which is the constant term. So, as I calculated earlier, that term has a coefficient of 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 * 20 = 120. Wait, but just to make sure I'm not missing anything, let me think again. Suppose I didn't consider the \\(c\\) terms, would that affect the coefficient? No, because \\(a^2b^2\\) is independent of \\(c\\), so when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by any term in the second polynomial, the only way to get a term without \\(c\\) is if you multiply by the constant term. So, yes, that's correct. Therefore, the coefficient is indeed 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is found using the binomial coefficient \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). For the term \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the constant term (where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0) occurs when \\(m = 3\\), giving the coefficient \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying these coefficients together gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

    "text": " Therefore, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part gets multiplied by the constant term in the second part, which is 20. So, 6 times 20 is 120. That seems correct. I don't think I made a mistake here. Let me just recap to make sure I didn't miss anything. The problem asks for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product of two expansions. Since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the only way to get a term with \\(a^2b^2\\) is to take the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first expansion and multiply it by the constant term (the term with \\(c^0\\)) from the second expansion. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part is 20. Multiplying these together gives 120. So, I think the answer is 120.\n\nWait, just to be thorough, let me consider if there's any other way \\(a^2b^2\\) could come up. For example, could there be terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by some \\(c\\) terms and then those \\(c\\) terms cancel out? But no, because \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term in the first polynomial, and when you multiply it by any term from the second polynomial, which is in \\(c\\), you'd end up with a term that has \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some \\(k\\). The only way to get a term that's just \\(a^2b^2\\) is if it's multiplied by the constant term in the second polynomial, which is \\(c^0\\). So, that's the only contribution. Therefore, my calculation is correct.
