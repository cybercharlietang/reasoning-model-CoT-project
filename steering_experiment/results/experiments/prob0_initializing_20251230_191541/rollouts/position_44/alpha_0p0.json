Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Is there another way to approach this problem? Maybe by expanding both expressions separately and then multiplying the relevant terms. Let's try that to confirm.\n\nFirst, expand \\((a + b)^4\\):\n\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\n\\]\n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6.\n\nNext, expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):\n\nUsing the binomial theorem:\n\n\\[\n\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n\\]\n\nWe need the term where the exponent is 0, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which gives \\(m = 3\\).

For example, could there be other terms in the second expansion that, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), result in a term without \\(c\\)? Let me think. The second expansion has terms with various powers of \\(c\\). The only way a term from the second expansion multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\) would result in a term without \\(c\\) is if the second term is \\(c^0\\), which is 20. Any other term would have a \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), so when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), the result would have a \\(c\\) term. Therefore, only the constant term from the second expansion contributes to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product.\n\nTherefore, I can confidently say that the coefficient is 120.\n\nWait, but just to be thorough, let me consider an alternative approach.

So, when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\).

Now, when I multiply these two expansions together, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. So, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first polynomial is 6a^2b^2. When I multiply this by each term in the second polynomial, I get 6a^2b^2c^6 + 6a^2b^2c^4 + 6a^2b^2c^2 + 6a^2b^2*20 + 6a^2b^2/c^2 + 6a^2b^2/c^4 + 6a^2b^2/c^6.

Since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), the only way to get a term with \\(a^2b^2\\) and no \\(c\\) is by multiplying the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part by the constant term (i.e., \\(c^0\\)) from the second part.

Using the binomial theorem, we have:\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n\\]\nWe need the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which corresponds to \\(k = 2\\). The coefficient is:\n\\[\n\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\n\\]\n\nNext, consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem, we have:\n\\[\n\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n\\]\nWe need the coefficient of \\(c^0\\), which corresponds to \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(m = 3\\). The coefficient is:\n\\[\n\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\n\\]\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficients from each part:\n\\[\n6 \\times 20 = 120\n\\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."
