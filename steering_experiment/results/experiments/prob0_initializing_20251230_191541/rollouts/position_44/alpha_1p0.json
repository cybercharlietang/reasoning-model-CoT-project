So, yes, the coefficient is 6 times 20, which is 120. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't miss anything. Is there a possibility that other terms from the second polynomial could combine in a way that the \\(c\\) terms cancel out, leading to a term without \\(c\\)? For example, if I take a term with \\(c^1\\) and multiply it by a term with \\(c^{-1}\\), that would give me \\(c^0\\).

I think that makes sense. Let me see if there's another way to approach this problem. Alternatively, I could think of the entire expression as a product of two independent expansions. So, the first expansion is in terms of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the second is in terms of \\(c\\). Since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are different variables, their exponents don't interfere with each other. So, when looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I can treat the \\(c\\) part as a constant because I'm only interested in the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\).

Let me see if I can think of any alternative methods or if there's a way this could go wrong. Suppose I didn't consider the constant term in the \\(c\\) expansion. Then, I might have thought that the coefficient is just 6, but that's not correct because the entire expression is multiplied by the \\(c\\) terms. So, if I ignore the \\(c\\) part, I'm effectively not considering the entire expression. Therefore, it's essential to account for the constant term in the \\(c\\) expansion because that's the only part that will multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term without introducing any \\(c\\) terms. So, that's why I have to multiply by 20. Alternatively, if I were to multiply out the entire expression, I would have terms like \\(a^2b^2 \\times c^k\\) for various \\(k\\), but since we're only interested in the term where there's no \\(c\\), we take \\(k = 0\\), which gives us \\(a^2b^2\\) times the constant term. Therefore, the coefficient is indeed 6 times 20, which is 120. I think that's solid. Let me just recap to make sure I didn't skip any steps. First, expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is 6. Then, expand \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\), which is 20. Multiply these two coefficients together to get 120.

Using the binomial theorem, we have:\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n\\]\nThe term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\), so the coefficient is:\n\\[\n\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\n\\]\n\nNext, consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).

    "text": " The question is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would be the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\), because any other power of \\(c\\) would make the term have \\(c\\) in it, which we don't want. So, that term would be \\(6 \\times 20 \\times a^2b^2c^0\\), which is \\(120a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient is 120. Wait, is there any other way this could be approached? Maybe by considering the entire expansion and looking for cross terms, but I think the approach I took is correct. Let me just make sure I didn't miss anything. So, the key idea is that to get the term \\(a^2b^2\\), you need to take \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part and multiply it by the constant term from the second part. Since the second part is in terms of \\(c\\), any other term would introduce a \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\) factor, which would change the term we're looking for. So, yes, I think 120 is the correct coefficient. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is 120.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Is there a possibility that the term \\(a^2b^2\\) could come from other combinations? For example, if I take a term with \\(a^1b^3\\) from the first part and multiply it by a term with \\(c^{-1}\\) from the second part, would that somehow result in \\(a^2b^2\\)? Hmm, no, because the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are determined solely by the first part. The second part only affects the exponents of \\(c\\). So, the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are independent of the exponents of \\(c\\). Therefore, to get \\(a^2b^2\\), you have to take \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part and any term from the second part, but since we're looking for the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\), that's the only way. So, no, there's no cross-term effect here. Therefore, 120 is indeed the correct coefficient.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of it as the product of two independent expansions. The first expansion gives me \\(a^2b^2\\) with coefficient 6, and the second expansion gives me a constant term with coefficient 20. So, when I multiply these together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) gets multiplied by 20, resulting in a coefficient of 6 * 20 = 120. That seems consistent.\n\nJust to make sure, let me try to write out the expansions more explicitly. For \\((a + b)^4\\), the expansion is:\n\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\n\\]\n\nSo, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term is indeed 6a^2b^2.\n\nNow, for \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the expansion is:\n\n\\[\n\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15(1/c^2) + 6(1/c^4) + 1/c^6\n\\]\n\nSo, the constant term is 20. Therefore, when you multiply these two expansions together, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), we only consider the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by the constant term 20. So, the coefficient becomes 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but actually, when you multiply two polynomials, every term from the first is multiplied by every term from the second. So, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. But since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), we only consider the product where the second term is \\(c^0\\), which is 20. All other terms would introduce \\(c\\) terms, so they wouldn't contribute to the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. Therefore, the only contribution is from the constant term in the second polynomial.\n\nSo, yes, I think that's correct. Therefore, the coefficient is 120.\n\nJust to make sure, let me consider an alternative approach. Maybe using generating functions or considering the problem differently. But I think the approach I took is straightforward and correct. So, I'm confident that the coefficient is 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem for both parts of the expression.\n\n1. **Expanding \\((a + b)^4\\):**\n   Using the binomial theorem, the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is:\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term with \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\):\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\n   \\]\n   So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\n2. **Expanding \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   Using the binomial theorem, the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is:\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n   \\]\n   We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0:\n   \\[\n   6 - 2m = 0 \\implies m = 3\n   \\]\n   The coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\n   \\]\n\n3. **Combining the results:**\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficients from each part:\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 20 = 120\n   \\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

But wait, no, actually, the \\(c\\) terms are separate. So, when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first polynomial will be multiplied by every term in the second polynomial. But since the second polynomial has terms with different powers of \\(c\\), the entire product will have terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) where \\(k\\) can be from -6 to 6 in steps of 2, I think. But the question is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would include all the terms where the power of \\(c\\) is zero because only then does the term become \\(a^2b^2\\) times 1. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part.
