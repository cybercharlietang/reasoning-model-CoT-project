Since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are different variables, their exponents don't interfere with each other.

Let me write out \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) separately, find the required coefficients, and then multiply them. For \\((a + b)^4\\), as I did before, the expansion is \\(a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6.

    "text": " So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120. Let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes in my reasoning. First, I correctly identified that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. Then, I correctly expanded \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem and found that the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Multiplying these together gives 120. I don't think I made any calculation errors. Let me just verify the binomial coefficients again. For \\((a + b)^4\\), \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\), which is correct. For \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\), which is also correct. So, 6 times 20 is indeed 120. Therefore, I think the coefficient is 120.\n\nWait, but let me consider another approach to ensure I'm not missing anything. Alternatively, I can think of the entire expression as the product of two expansions. So, \\((a + b)^4\\) is \\(a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\), and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is \\(c^6 + 6c^5 \\times (1/c) + 15c^4 \\times (1/c)^2 + 20c^3 \\times (1/c)^3 + 15c^2 \\times (1/c)^4 + 6c \\times (1/c)^5 + (1/c)^6\\). Simplifying the second expansion, that becomes \\(c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15/c^2 + 6/c^4 + 1/c^6\\). Now, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) with this, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will only combine with the constant term 20 in the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion has a coefficient of 6, and when multiplied by 20, gives 6 \u00d7 20 = 120. So, that confirms the same result. Therefore, I'm confident that the coefficient is 120.\n\nAnother way to think about it is considering the variables separately. Since the expression is a product of two independent binomials, the coefficients multiply when the variables don't interfere. So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, and the coefficient for the constant term in the other expansion is 20, so their product is 120. Yeah, that seems solid.\n\nI don't think I missed any steps. I considered each part separately, found the necessary coefficients, and then multiplied them. I also double-checked by expanding both expressions partially and confirming that the only contributing term is the product of the \\(a^2b^2\\) term and the constant term. So, I think I'm good.

The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which comes from the product of the \\(a^2b^2\\) term and the constant term in the second polynomial. Since the second polynomial is in terms of \\(c\\), and \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables, their exponents won't interfere with the \\(c\\) terms. So, I think this is correct. Therefore, the coefficient is 120.\n\nWait, but hold on a second. Let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in calculating the binomial coefficients. For \\((a + b)^4\\), \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) is indeed 6, because \\(4!/(2!2!) = 24/(2*2) = 24/4 = 6\\).

So, 6 times 20 is 120, which seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think about it another way to confirm. Let me expand both expressions separately and then see how the terms interact. So, \\((a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6. Then, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), expanding it, the constant term is the middle term when \\(m = 3\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, when I multiply these two expansions, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first will multiply the constant term 20 from the second, giving \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\) as the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\).\n\nWait, but the problem is written as \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\).

The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, when expanding, each term from the first expansion is multiplied by each term from the second expansion. However, since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), we need to find the product of the term with \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and the term with \\(c^0\\) in the second part. That seems correct because any other term from the second part would involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), which would mean the product term would have a \\(c\\) factor, which we don't want. So, yeah, the coefficient should be 6 times 20, which is 120. I think that makes sense. So, the final answer should be 120. Let me just recap to make sure I didn't skip any steps. 1.

Multiply these two coefficients together to get the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, which is 6 * 20 = 120. I don't see any mistakes in this reasoning.

    "text": " So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120. Wait, but hold on a second. Is there any other term that could contribute to \\(a^2b^2\\) when multiplied by some \\(c\\) term? For example, if I have a term with \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) and another term with \\(c^{-k}\\), would that contribute to \\(a^2b^2\\) when multiplied? Hmm, but in the original expression, it's \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second. So, if I take \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part and multiply it by, say, \\(c^3\\) from the second part, I get \\(a^2b^2c^3\\). Similarly, if I take \\(a^2b^2\\) and multiply it by \\(1/c^3\\), I get \\(a^2b^2/c^3\\). But the term \\(a^2b^2\\) itself would only come from \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by the constant term \\(c^0\\). So, no other terms would result in \\(a^2b^2\\) because any other term would have some power of \\(c\\) attached. Therefore, the only contribution to \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the product of the \\(a^2b^2\\) term and the constant term in the second expansion. So, the coefficient is indeed 6 multiplied by 20, which is 120. Wait, but let me think again. Is there a way that when you multiply terms from the two expansions, you might end up with \\(a^2b^2\\) without involving \\(c\\)? For example, if you have a term like \\(a^3b\\) from the first expansion and a term like \\(c^{-1}\\) from the second, would that ever combine with another term to give \\(a^2b^2\\)? Hmm, no, because each term is a product of a term from each expansion. So, to get \\(a^2b^2\\), you have to have a term from the first expansion that has \\(a^2b^2\\) and a term from the second expansion that has \\(c^0\\). Any other combination would result in a term that includes \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), which would not be \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, my initial reasoning seems correct. So, the coefficient is 120. Wait, but just to be thorough, let me consider if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. But no, the problem is specifically asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which implies that it's looking for the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\), because otherwise, if there were \\(c\\) terms, it would specify. So, yeah, I think 120 is the correct answer. Wait, but just to make sure, let me consider the entire expansion. Let me write out the product:\n\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\n\\]\nand\n\\[\n\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = c^6 + 6c^5 + 15c^4 + 20c^3 + 15c^2 + 6c + 1 + 6/c + 15/c^2 + 20/c^3 + 15/c^4 + 6/c^5 + 1/c^6\n\\]\n\nSo, when you multiply these two, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But only the term \\(1\\) in the second expansion (the constant term) will result in \\(a^2b^2\\) when multiplied. All other terms will have \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), so they won't contribute to the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. Therefore, the coefficient is indeed \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). I think that's solid. So, the final answer is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Multiplying these gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\boxed{120}."

Another way to approach this is to consider the entire expansion, but that seems more complicated.
