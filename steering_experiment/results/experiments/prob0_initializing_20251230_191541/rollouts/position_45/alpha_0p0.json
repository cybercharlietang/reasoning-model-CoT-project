Then, I recognized that to get a term without \\(c\\) in the product, I needed to multiply by the constant term from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which I found by setting the exponent to 0, leading me to find the coefficient as 20. Multiplying these together gives 120. I don't think I made any mistakes here. So, the final answer should be 120.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break the problem into two parts:\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\):\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} a^{2}b^{2} = 6a^2b^2\n   \\]\n   So, the coefficient is 6.\n\n2. **Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) and find the constant term:**\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n   \\]\n   We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0:\n   \\[\n   6 - 2m = 0 \\implies m = 3\n   \\]\n   The coefficient is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\n   \\]\n\n3. **Multiply the coefficients from both parts:**\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 20 = 120\n   \\]\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

    "text": " So, that seems correct. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120. Wait, but just to be thorough, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in calculating the binomial coefficients. For \\((a + b)^4\\), \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\), that's correct. For \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term where the exponent is 0 is when \\(m = 3\\), so \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\), that's correct too. So, 6 times 20 is indeed 120. Therefore, I think I've arrived at the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Multiplying these gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\boxed{120}."
