    "text": " So, I think that's correct. But just to be thorough, let me consider if there's any other way this term could be formed. For example, could there be other terms in \\((a + b)^4\\) that, when multiplied by terms in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), result in \\(a^2b^2\\) without involving \\(c\\)? Hmm, no, because any term from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) that isn't the constant term would introduce a power of \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), which would mean the resulting term would have a \\(c\\) term, which we don't want. Therefore, the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms is to multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term by the constant term in the second polynomial. So, yes, the coefficient is indeed 120.
