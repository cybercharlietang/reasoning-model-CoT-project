    "text": " But wait, the problem is only asking about the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). That means I don't need to consider the \\(c\\) terms because they are separate variables. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would just be the same as the coefficient in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, no, actually, when you multiply two expressions together, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and the other part involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), which are different variables, those terms won't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) exponents. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, that doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\). Therefore, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When you expand this, each term will be a product of a term from \\((a + b)^4\\) and a term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, that would mean the coefficient is 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so perhaps I'm misunderstanding. Maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, but since \\(c\\) and \\(a\\), \\(b\\) are independent, the coefficient would just be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems odd because the coefficient would then be a polynomial, not a single number. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only considering the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, so the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that's not quite right either because the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) vary depending on the term. Maybe I should think of it as the entire product, and the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by every term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean I need to find the sum of the coefficients of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, the sum of the coefficients of a polynomial is found by substituting \\(c = 1\\). So, if I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = (2)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 64. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 times 64, which is 384. Wait, but that seems high. Let me check again. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Since \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from \\((a + b)^4\\), and when you multiply by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the product will be \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is just 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 6 times 64, which is 384. But wait, that seems correct because each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) will multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term, so the coefficient becomes 6 multiplied by the sum of the coefficients of the other part. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. So, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Wait, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion of the entire expression, treating all variables together. But since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are independent variables, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for any \\(k\\) would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^k\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would mean that it's considering all possible terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present, regardless of the power of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 6 times 64, which is 384. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which would be the same as the coefficient in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of the other part. But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and not \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), it's possible that the answer is just 6, but that seems unlikely because the other part is being multiplied in. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating all variables as separate, but I think that the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients of the other part. Let me try another approach. Let me consider that when you multiply two expressions, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each factor. But in this case, since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are in one factor and \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) are in the other, the terms in the product will have combinations of \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\), and \\(1/c\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would come from multiplying \\(a^2b^2\\) from \\((a + b)^4\\) with any term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial, not a number. Therefore, perhaps the problem is only considering the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, but the coefficient would then be a polynomial in \\(c\\). However, the problem is phrased as \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", which suggests it's a numerical coefficient, so maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, ignoring the \\(c\\) terms, which would just be 6. But that seems too simple. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, which would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 6 times 64, which is 384. I think that's the correct approach because when you multiply by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in the other expansion, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the other expansion, which is 64, giving 384. Let me verify this. The sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is indeed found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\(2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 * 64 = 384. So, I think that's the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6. Then, since the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the sum of the coefficients in this part is 64 (found by setting \\(c = 1\\)). Multiplying these together gives \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\boxed{384}."

Wait, no, that can't be right because the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try a different approach. Let me consider that when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from those involving \\(c\\).

Wait, but the sum of all coefficients in a polynomial is found by setting all variables to 1. So, if I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) becomes \\((1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 64.

So, \\((a + b)^4\\) gives \\(a^2b^2\\) with coefficient 6, and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) when evaluated at \\(c = 1\\) is 64, so the total coefficient would be 6 * 64 = 384. Hmm, that makes sense because when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in one polynomial times the sum of all coefficients in the other polynomial gives the coefficient of that term in the product.

Let me think about that. When you multiply two expressions together, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression. So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), it would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the entire second part, because any term in the second part would just add more variables, but since we're only interested in \\(a^2b^2\\), the variables from the second part would just be multiplied as is. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 times whatever the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is. But wait, no, that doesn't make sense because we're not combining like terms across the two expressions. Wait, actually, no. The problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, but the product would have terms that are products of terms from each expansion. But since the second part doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), any term from the second part would just be a constant (with respect to \\(a\\) and \\(b\\)) when considering the product. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, that seems off because the problem is probably expecting a numerical coefficient, not an expression in terms of \\(c\\). Hmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)\". Wait, so maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient when you expand the entire product, but only considering the terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) appear, regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). But that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which would make the coefficient a polynomial in \\(c\\). But that doesn't seem right because usually, when someone asks for the coefficient of a specific term, they're considering all variables. So, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, and the second part is just a constant factor. But that doesn't make sense because \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is definitely not a constant. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the entire product and wants the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). In that case, the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that would mean the coefficient is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me think: the sum of the coefficients in a polynomial is found by plugging in \\(c = 1\\). So, if I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = (2)^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of the coefficients is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 * 64 = 384. Wait, but that seems too straightforward. Let me check again. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\), i.e., a constant term with respect to \\(c\\). That would make more sense. So, in that case, I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, first, as before, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. Now, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me expand that. Using the binomial theorem again: \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, we're looking for the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, which means \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), \\(6 = 2k\\) => \\(k = 3\\). So, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Now, multiplying the two coefficients together: 6 (from \\(a^2b^2\\)) times 20 (from \\(c^0\\)) gives 120. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire expression is 120. Wait, but the problem just says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", without specifying the power of \\(c\\). So, perhaps it's considering all possible powers of \\(c\\), which would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that would result in a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense for a single coefficient. Therefore, I think the intended interpretation is that we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\).

Wait, actually, the \\(c\\) terms are separate from \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), so when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion gets multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which comes from the first part, the second part might just contribute a factor that multiplies the coefficient. Let me think. So, \\((a + b)^4\\) gives us 6 as the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\), and then we have \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, does that mean that the coefficient is 6 times whatever the constant term is in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)? Because if we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), any \\(c\\) terms would have to be multiplied by something else to contribute to \\(a^2b^2\\), but since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), the only way for the product to have \\(a^2b^2\\) is if the other part doesn't contribute any \\(c\\) terms, meaning we need the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me expand that using the binomial theorem as well. The expansion is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying each term, that becomes \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m} = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). Now, we need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, because that's the constant term. So, we set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which gives \\(m = 3\\). So, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\), which is \\(\\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (the constant term from the second part), which is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). So, the coefficient is 120.\n\nWait, let me make sure I didn't miss anything. The problem is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), and we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are in the first part, and \\(c\\) is in the second part, the only way \\(a^2b^2\\) can appear in the product is if we take the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part and multiply it by the constant term from the second part. So, yes, that makes sense. The other terms in the second expansion would introduce \\(c\\) terms, which would make the product have \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or similar, but we're only interested in \\(a^2b^2\\), so the \\(c\\) part has to be the constant term.

But since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), the coefficients for the terms in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) would be independent of the coefficients in \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, maybe the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, that doesn't make sense because when you multiply two polynomials, each term is a product of terms from each polynomial. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that can't be right because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, not an expression. Hmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" Wait, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, in other words, when you expand the entire expression, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by some combination of terms from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but since \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) are separate variables, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be the product of the coefficients from each part. Wait, but that would mean the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which would make the coefficient a polynomial in \\(c\\), not a single number. But the problem is asking for the coefficient, so maybe I'm supposed to consider that \\(a^2b^2\\) is just a term, and the coefficient would include the product of the coefficients from both parts. But that doesn't make sense because \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\). Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some \\(k\\), but it's not specified. Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again. The problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when you multiply these two expressions, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from \\((a + b)^4\\) would be multiplied by every term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would actually be \\(6 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that can't be right because the coefficient should be a number, not an expression involving \\(c\\). Wait, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, so the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem doesn't specify, so perhaps I'm missing something. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), meaning the constant term in \\(c\\). That would make sense because then the coefficient would be a number. So, perhaps I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the expansion. Let me assume that's the case. So, the coefficient would be the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). That would make sense because when you multiply the two expansions, the terms where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out (i.e., \\(c^0\\)) would contribute to the constant term. So, let's proceed with that assumption. First, as I calculated earlier, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. Now, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). To do that, I can use the binomial theorem again. Let's expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The general term in the expansion is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We want the exponent of \\(c\\) to be 0, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Now, since the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6 and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part is 20, the overall coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) (assuming we're considering the constant term in \\(c\\)) is 120. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake. So, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, and in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Multiplying them gives 120. That seems correct. Alternatively, if the problem was just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without considering \\(c\\), then the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which would mean the coefficient is a polynomial. But since the problem asks for the coefficient, and coefficients are usually numerical, I think the intended interpretation is that we're looking for the coefficient when considering the product, specifically the constant term in \\(c\\). So, I think 120 is the correct answer.\n\nWait, but let me check again. If I expand \\((a + b)^4\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) has a coefficient of 6. Then, when I multiply by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) gets multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by every term from the second part, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), \\(a^2b^2c^2\\), \\(a^2b^2\\), \\(a^2b^2c^{-2}\\), etc. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) (i.e., the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0) is indeed 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion, which is 20, giving 120. So, I think I'm confident that the coefficient is 120.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Suppose I don't assume that we're looking for the constant term in \\(c\\). Then, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually be a polynomial in \\(c\\), which is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is \\(6(c + 1/c)^6\\), which is not a number. Therefore, the problem must be asking for the coefficient when considering the product, but perhaps only the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present regardless of \\(c\\). But in that case, the coefficient would still involve \\(c\\), so I think the intended interpretation is that we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is written as \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), and we're to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), treating \\(c\\) as another variable, but without any specific power. In that case, the coefficient would indeed be 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial. But the problem says \"the coefficient\", implying a numerical value, so I think the correct approach is to consider the constant term in \\(c\\), making the coefficient 120.\n\nSo, to summarize:\n\n1. Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is 6.\n2. Expand \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\), which is 20.\n3. Multiply these coefficients together to get 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) (considering the constant term in \\(c\\)) is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplying it by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20. Therefore, the overall coefficient is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\boxed{120}"

Because if I multiply by any other term involving \\(c\\), it would introduce a \\(c\\) term into the product, which would make it \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or something, but the problem is only asking for \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term without \\(c\\). So, the only contribution to \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the product of the \\(a^2b^2\\) term and the constant term in the second expansion. Therefore, I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me calculate that. Using the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). The constant term occurs when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. So, set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20.

Multiplying them together gives 6 * 20 = 120. Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe I can think of it as the entire expression being the product of two expansions, so the coefficient is the product of the coefficients from each part that contribute to the term \\(a^2b^2\\). Since the \\(c\\) part doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms, it's just a scaling factor. So, yeah, 6 times 20 is 120.

Wait, that might make sense. So, the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, first, let me find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Again, using the binomial theorem, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying that, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m} = \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We want the exponent of \\(c\\) to be zero, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\).

So, 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120. Wait, let me just double-check that. So, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, correct. Then, in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term where \\(c^0\\) is when m=3, which is 20.

So, in other words, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).

But wait, no, that's not quite correct either because the coefficients in the second expansion are specific to each term, not just a single value. Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try another approach. Let's consider that the entire expression is the product of two separate expansions: one in terms of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the other in terms of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). Since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\), and \\(1/c\\) are all different variables, when we multiply them, the only way \\(a^2b^2\\) can appear is from the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), and the second part contributes only to the \\(c\\) terms. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, that makes sense because when you multiply by the second polynomial, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial. So, I need to find the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). How do I find the sum of all coefficients in a polynomial? Well, the sum of all coefficients is found by substituting \\(c = 1\\) into the polynomial. Because when \\(c = 1\\), each term becomes just its coefficient, and the sum is the total of all coefficients. So, let's compute \\(\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = (1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 64 (from the second part), which is 6 * 64 = 384. Wait, but that seems high. Let me check my reasoning again. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). In the product \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is multiplied by every term in the second part, each of which has coefficients. So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which is indeed 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, another way to think about it is that each term in the product is a combination of a term from the first polynomial and a term from the second. Since we're only interested in terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) appears, regardless of the power of \\(c\\), the coefficient will be the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial and the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial. So, I think my calculation is correct. Therefore, the coefficient is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplying it by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 64. Thus, the final coefficient is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{384}\n\\]"

Alternatively, perhaps I need to consider the entire expansion. Wait, no, the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, actually, maybe the coefficient is just 6 times whatever the coefficient is from the second part, but actually, no, because the second part is multiplied by the first part, but \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), so the coefficient would just be 6 times the sum over all terms in the second expansion, but that doesn't make sense because the second part is multiplied by the first. Wait, no, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think again. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). When we expand this, each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), we can find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and then multiply it by the entire expansion of the second part, because \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), so when you multiply by the second part, it's like multiplying by a polynomial in \\(c\\), but the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Wait, no, that's not right. Because the second part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), when expanded, will have terms with various powers of \\(c\\), but when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), each term will have \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by a term involving \\(c\\). But the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product will be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), because each term in the second expansion will multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. Wait, but no, that's not correct because each term in the second expansion is a different power of \\(c\\), so when you multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), each term will have \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2/c^k\\), etc. But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which implies that we're considering the term where the exponents of \\(c\\) are zero, because otherwise, it's a different term. Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\)\". So, it's the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), because each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) will multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term, and we need to sum all those contributions. But wait, that doesn't seem right because the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be 6 times the sum of the coefficients of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 times \\(2^6\\) because each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) has coefficients that are either 1 or something else, but wait, no, the sum of the coefficients is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), so \\(\\left(1 + 1/1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 * 64 = 384. But wait, that seems too high. Alternatively, maybe I'm making a mistake here. Let me think again. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would indeed be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), because when you multiply, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384. But wait, is that correct? Let me check with a smaller example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, expanding, \\((a^2 + 2ab + b^2) \\times (c + 1/c)\\). The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 1 (from \\(a^2\\)) times 0 (since there's no \\(b^2\\) in the first part, but wait, no, the first part is \\((a + b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2\\). So, in the product, the term \\(a^2 \\times (c + 1/c)\\) would give \\(a^2c + a^2/c\\), similarly for the other terms. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which in this case would only come from \\(b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion. Wait, but in this small example, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^1 = c + 1/c\\), so the term with \\(c^0\\) is zero because there's no constant term. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be zero. But according to my earlier logic, the coefficient would be 1 (from \\(b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^2\\)) times the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^1\\), which is 2, so 1 * 2 = 2, which is incorrect because the actual coefficient is zero. So, that means my earlier approach is wrong. Therefore, I need a different approach. Maybe I should consider that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is just the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the coefficient from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) that doesn't involve \\(c\\), but that doesn't make sense because \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) doesn't have a constant term unless the exponent is even? Wait, no, let's check: \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) can be expanded using the binomial theorem: \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\times (1/c)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero would be when \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which implies \\(k = 3\\). So, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 20 = 120. Wait, that makes sense because in the product, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part would be multiplied by the constant term from the second part, which is 20, so 6 * 20 = 120. Let me check this with my small example. If I have \\((a + b)^2 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^1\\), then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^2\\) times the constant term from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^1\\). But \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^1\\) doesn't have a constant term, as I saw earlier, so the coefficient would be zero, which matches the actual expansion. So, in the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 * 20 = 120. Wait, but let me make sure. Alternatively, maybe I should consider that the entire product is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), and when looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), it's the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all coefficients from the second part, but that led to an incorrect result in the small example. So, perhaps the correct approach is that since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient is just the coefficient from the first part times the constant term from the second part, which is 6 * 20 = 120. Alternatively, maybe I can think of it as the product of the two expansions, and the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is only affected by the constant term in the second expansion, because any other term would introduce a power of \\(c\\), making it not just \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120. Let me confirm this by considering the general term in the expansion. The expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^4 \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\\), and the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^6 \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). When you multiply these together, each term is \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k \\times \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) occurs when \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\), as before, and \\(m\\) can be any value from 0 to 6, but since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), we need to sum over all \\(m\\). Wait, no, that's not correct because each term in the product will have a specific power of \\(c\\), so the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, leading to terms like \\(a^2b^2c^{6 - 2m}\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which implies that we're considering the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in other words, we need to find all terms where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2, regardless of the exponents of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient would be the coefficient from the first part, 6, multiplied by the entire sum of coefficients from the second part, which is \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\), so 6 * 64 = 384. But wait, this contradicts my earlier conclusion. So, which one is correct? Let me think again. If the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then yes, it would be 6 * 64 = 384. However, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\), then it would be 6 * 20 = 120. But the problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", without specifying anything about \\(c\\), so I think it's the former: 384. But wait, in my small example, that approach gave an incorrect result. Let me check that again. In the small example: \\((a + b)^2 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^1\\). The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 1 (from \\(b^2\\)) times the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^1\\), which is 2, so 1 * 2 = 2. But when I expand it, I get \\(a^2c + a^2/c + 2ab + 2ab/c + b^2c + b^2/c\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't actually exist because there's no \\(a^2b^2\\) term; the terms are \\(a^2c\\), \\(a^2/c\\), etc., and \\(ab\\) terms. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is zero, not 2. Therefore, my approach of multiplying the coefficient from the first part by the sum of coefficients from the second part is incorrect. Therefore, the correct approach must be to consider that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is only affected by the terms in the second expansion that don't involve \\(c\\), i.e., the constant term. Therefore, the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120. So, in the small example, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be zero because there's no constant term in the second expansion. Therefore, the correct answer is 120. Let me just confirm this with another example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^1 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^2\\). The expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^2\\) is \\(c^2 + 2 + 1/c^2\\). So, the constant term is 2. The coefficient of \\(ab\\) in \\((a + b)^1\\) is 1. So, the coefficient of \\(ab\\) in the product would be 1 * 2 = 2. When I expand \\((a + b)(c^2 + 2 + 1/c^2)\\), I get \\(a c^2 + 2a + a/c^2 + b c^2 + 2b + b/c^2\\). So, the term \\(ab\\) doesn't exist; instead, the terms are \\(a c^2\\), \\(2a\\), etc. Wait, so the coefficient of \\(ab\\) is zero, not 2. Hmm, that's confusing. Wait, no, in this case, the first part is \\((a + b)\\), so the term \\(ab\\) doesn't exist in the first part; instead, it's \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) separately. So, when multiplied by the second expansion, the terms would be \\(a \\times (c^2 + 2 + 1/c^2)\\) and \\(b \\times (c^2 + 2 + 1/c^2)\\). Therefore, there is no \\(ab\\) term in the product, so the coefficient of \\(ab\\) is zero, not 2. So, that suggests that my approach is still incorrect. Therefore, perhaps the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the original problem is zero because there's no such term. Wait, that can't be right because \\((a + b)^4\\) does have an \\(a^2b^2\\) term, and when multiplied by the second expansion, it would still have that term, but multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of the second part, leading to 6 * 64 = 384. But in the small example, that approach gave an incorrect result. So, I'm confused. Maybe I need to think differently. Let me consider that the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product comes from multiplying \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part by each term in the second part. So, the coefficient would be 6 times each coefficient in the second expansion, leading to 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. However, in the small example, this approach gave an incorrect result because the actual coefficient was zero, not 2. So, perhaps the problem is that in the small example, the first part doesn't have an \\(a^2b^2\\) term, so the coefficient is zero, but in the original problem, the first part does have an \\(a^2b^2\\) term, so the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of coefficients in the second part, which is 384. But in the small example, the first part didn't have an \\(a^2b^2\\) term, so the coefficient was zero. Therefore, in the original problem, since the first part does have an \\(a^2b^2\\) term, the coefficient would be 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it, and the correct approach is to recognize that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. So, I think that's the answer.\n\nWait, no, I think I made a mistake. Let me try to clarify. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are independent variables, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the coefficient from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) that corresponds to the term where \\(c^0\\), because otherwise, the term would have a power of \\(c\\), making it not just \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient is 6 (from \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\)) times the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 20. So, 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the correct coefficient is 120.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought that in the small example, this approach would give the correct result. Let me check that again. In the small example: \\((a + b)^2 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^1\\). The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient from the first part (which is 1 for \\(a^2\\) and 1 for \\(b^2\\)) times the constant term from the second part. But the second part doesn't have a constant term, so the coefficient is zero, which matches the actual expansion. Therefore, in the original problem, the coefficient is 6 times 20, which is 120.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So, the correct answer is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20.

So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I need to find all the terms where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2 each, regardless of the exponents of \\(c\\). Hmm, but wait, actually, the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), so maybe the \\(c\\) terms can be considered as separate factors, but I'm not sure.

But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), perhaps we can treat the two parts separately. Wait, that might not be correct because when you multiply, the terms from both expansions get multiplied together. But if we're looking for a term that only has \\(a^2b^2\\), then the \\(c\\) part must be 1, because any power of \\(c\\) would make it not just \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, but that's not possible because \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) when expanded will have terms with different powers of \\(c\\), so when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), each term would have \\(a^2b^2\\) times some power of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Wait, no, that doesn't make sense because when you multiply two expressions, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, if I'm looking for a term that's \\(a^2b^2\\), then the other factor from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) must be 1, because \\(a^2b^2\\) is just a constant term with respect to \\(c\\). Wait, that can't be right because \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) doesn't have a constant term unless there's a term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. So, maybe I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) and then multiply it by the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\). Because then, when you multiply those two terms together, you'd get \\(a^2b^2\\) times that constant term, so the coefficient would be the product of the two coefficients. So, that makes sense. So, first, find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which we already found to be 6. Then, find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). The constant term would be the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. Let's apply the binomial theorem to \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). The expansion is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(1/c\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We want the exponent of \\(c\\) to be zero, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). So, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20. Now, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the two coefficients we found: 6 (from \\((a + b)^4\\)) and 20 (from the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\)). So, 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120.\n\nWait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake. So, I considered that when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second. But since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), the only way that can happen is if we take the term from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) that is a constant (i.e., the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero). So, that term is 20, as we calculated. Then, the term from \\((a + b)^4\\) is \\(a^2b^2\\) with coefficient 6. So, when you multiply these two terms together, you get 6 * 20 = 120 times \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient is indeed 120. I think that makes sense. Let me just check if there's another way to think about it. Alternatively, maybe I can consider that the entire expression is a product of two independent expansions, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the sum of all terms from the second part.

    "text": " But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), maybe the terms involving \\(c\\) don't matter here? Wait, no, actually, the entire expression is multiplied together, so perhaps I need to consider how the terms combine. Wait, but the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\). So, does that mean that when we multiply the two expansions, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but since we're only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), the \\(c\\) terms can be anything because they don't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) exponents. Wait, that doesn't seem right. Let me think again. When you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. So, if I have \\((a + b)^4\\) times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by every term in the second expansion. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product. Wait, that would mean that \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, but since the second expansion involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), none of those terms will affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) exponents. So, does that mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)? Or is it the sum of all the coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion? Wait, that might not be correct. Let me try to think differently. Maybe I can consider the entire expression as the product of two separate expansions, and the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient from the first part times the sum of the coefficients from the second part. But no, that doesn't make sense because the second part is not a constant; it's another expansion. So, perhaps the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is just the coefficient from the first part times the entire expansion of the second part, but since we're only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), the \\(c\\) terms don't affect it. Wait, but that can't be right because when you multiply, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, which includes terms with different powers of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would actually be the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all the coefficients from the second part. But wait, no, that's not correct either because each term in the second expansion has its own coefficient. Let me try to formalize this. Let me denote the first expansion as \\( (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{i=0}^4 \\dbinom{4}{i} a^{4 - i}b^i \\) and the second expansion as \\( \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{j=0}^6 \\dbinom{6}{j} c^{6 - j} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^j = \\sum_{j=0}^6 \\dbinom{6}{j} c^{6 - 2j} \\). Now, when you multiply these two expansions together, each term from the first sum is multiplied by each term from the second sum. So, the product is \\( \\sum_{i=0}^4 \\sum_{j=0}^6 \\dbinom{4}{i}\\dbinom{6}{j} a^{4 - i}b^i c^{6 - 2j} \\). Now, the problem asks for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, we need to find all terms where \\(4 - i = 2\\) and \\(i = 2\\). That is, \\(i = 2\\). So, for \\(i = 2\\), the term is \\( \\dbinom{4}{2} a^{2}b^{2} \\) times \\( \\sum_{j=0}^6 \\dbinom{6}{j} c^{6 - 2j} \\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is \\( \\dbinom{4}{2} \\times \\sum_{j=0}^6 \\dbinom{6}{j} \\). Wait, that can't be right because \\(\\sum_{j=0}^6 \\dbinom{6}{j}\\) is equal to \\(2^6 = 64\\). So, the coefficient would be \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). But that seems too large. Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me check again. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). But in the entire product, \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would indeed be \\( \\dbinom{4}{2} \\times \\left( \\sum_{j=0}^6 \\dbinom{6}{j} \\right) \\), because each term in the second expansion is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), so the coefficient is the sum of all the coefficients from the second expansion times the coefficient from the first part. But wait, let me think differently. Maybe the problem is only considering terms where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2, regardless of the exponents of \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would be \\( \\dbinom{4}{2} \\times \\left( \\sum_{j=0}^6 \\dbinom{6}{j} \\right) \\), which is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). But I'm not sure if that's correct because sometimes in such problems, they might be considering only the constant term in \\(c\\), but the problem doesn't specify that. Let me read the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" It doesn't mention anything about \\(c\\), so it's just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, that would mean that the coefficient is indeed \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). But wait, that seems a bit high. Let me check my reasoning again. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first expansion with coefficient 6. Then, it's multiplied by each term in the second expansion, each of which has a coefficient of \\(\\dbinom{6}{j}\\). So, when you multiply, the total coefficient for \\(a^2b^2c^{6 - 2j}\\) is \\(6 \\times \\dbinom{6}{j}\\). But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), it's the sum over all \\(j\\) of \\(6 \\times \\dbinom{6}{j}\\). So, that's \\(6 \\times \\sum_{j=0}^6 \\dbinom{6}{j} = 6 \\times 2^6 = 6 \\times 64 = 384\\). Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe I can think of it as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is equal to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because each term in the second expansion contributes its own coefficient when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). So, yes, that would make the coefficient \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). But wait, let me make sure. Let's take a simpler example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, the expansion would be \\((a^2 + 2ab + b^2) \\times (c + 1/c)\\). The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be zero because there's no \\(a^2b^2\\) term. Wait, no, that's not right because in this case, the second expansion only goes up to \\(c^1\\) and \\(c^{-1}\\), so when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a scalar, it would just be \\(a^2b^2\\) times each term in the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient from the first part times the sum of the coefficients from the second part. But in this case, the first part's coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) is zero because \\((a + b)^2\\) only has \\(a^2\\), \\(2ab\\), and \\(b^2\\). So, that's a different case. Let me try another example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^1 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, the expansion is \\((a + b)(c + 1/c)\\). The coefficient of \\(a\\) in this product would be \\(1 \\times (c + 1/c)\\), so the coefficient of \\(a\\) is \\(c + 1/c\\), but if we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a\\) regardless of \\(c\\), it's just 1 multiplied by the sum of coefficients in the second expansion, which is \\(1 + 1 = 2\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a\\) would be 2. Similarly, the coefficient of \\(b\\) would also be 2. That makes sense because when you expand, you get \\(ac + a/c + bc + b/c\\), so the coefficients of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are each 2, considering all powers of \\(c\\). So, applying that logic back to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient from the first expansion times the sum of coefficients from the second expansion. Therefore, it's \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). So, I think that's the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Then, since the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is multiplied by this term, the coefficient is multiplied by the sum of the coefficients of the second expansion, which is \\(2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n\\(\\boxed{384}\\)"

Hmm, I think it might, because when you multiply two expressions together, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression. So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I need to consider all possible terms in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) that, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), don't change the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). But wait, \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), so maybe the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't seem right because then the coefficient would be 6 times something, but the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which might not involve \\(c\\). Wait, no, the expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), so when you expand both, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) gets multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), does that mean we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms? Or perhaps, more accurately, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the product of the coefficients of \\(a^2b^2\\) in each part, but that might not be correct because the two parts are being multiplied together. Wait, no, that's not quite right. Because when you multiply two expressions, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, if I have \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part, it will be multiplied by every term in the second part, which includes various powers of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\). Wait, that's a bit confusing. Let me think again. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so perhaps it's considering the entire expression as a product, and we need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. But that's not possible because the expression includes both \\(a, b\\) and \\(c\\). Wait, no, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating \\(c\\) as another variable. So, in that case, the coefficient would be the product of the coefficients from each part. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) (since we don't want any \\(c\\) terms) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) would be... Wait, that's a good point. Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by terms from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), you get terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2c^{-k}\\). But if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), that would mean we need to consider all terms where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, because \\(c^0 = 1\\), so those would contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, in other words, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, now I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let's expand that using the binomial theorem as well. So, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be zero, so we set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the second part), which is 6 * 20 = 120. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake here. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\) with coefficient 6. Then, in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term with \\(c^0\\) is the middle term when \\(k = 3\\), which is indeed 20. So, when we multiply these two, the coefficient becomes 6 * 20 = 120. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120. Hmm, that seems right. Let me just check if there's another way to approach this. Alternatively, maybe I can think of the entire expression as \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), and since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are different variables, their exponents don't interfere with each other. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the product of the coefficients of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and the coefficient of any term in the second part that doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\). But since the second part only involves \\(c\\), which is a different variable, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would indeed be 6 * 20 = 120. Yeah, that makes sense. So, I think 120 is the correct coefficient.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by considering each part separately. \n\n1. **Expanding \\((a + b)^4\\):**\n   Using the binomial theorem, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\), giving the coefficient \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n\n2. **Expanding \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   The term with \\(c^0\\) (no \\(c\\) term) occurs when \\(k = 3\\), giving the coefficient \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n\n3. **Combining the coefficients:**\n   Multiply the coefficients from each part: \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

Because the second part is in terms of \\(c\\), so when we multiply, the terms in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) don't interact with those in \\(c\\).

Wait, that might not be accurate. Let me think again. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, without considering \\(c\\). So, in that case, the terms involving \\(c\\) would just be constants when considering the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, that might not be correct either because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the other part is in \\(c\\). So, perhaps when you multiply the two expressions, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first part will be multiplied by every term in the second part, but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, the coefficient would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. Wait, that doesn't make sense because the second part doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) exponents. So, maybe the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Let me check that. The sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) would be when \\(c = 1\\), so substituting \\(c = 1\\), we get \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, if that's the case, then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 64 (sum of coefficients in the second part), giving 6 * 64 = 384. But wait, let me think again. Is that correct? Because when you have a product of two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in one polynomial is multiplied by the entire other polynomial. So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), it's the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) polynomial. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), so the \\(c\\) terms would just be part of the coefficient. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would indeed be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but since we're only interested in the coefficient, not the entire term, perhaps we need to consider that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 multiplied by the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion. Wait, but that would mean the coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384, as I thought before. But let me check another way. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but since we're only interested in the coefficient, which is a number, maybe we just need to compute 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, giving 384. But I'm not entirely sure if that's the correct approach. Let me try another way. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating \\(c\\) as another variable. But since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are different variables, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would have a coefficient that is a polynomial in \\(c\\). So, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, which would be 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems unlikely because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, not a polynomial. So, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me re-read the problem: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), treating \\(c\\) as another variable, but perhaps the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by some terms involving \\(c\\). However, the problem might just be asking for the coefficient in front of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that's a polynomial in \\(c\\), not a number. So, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating \\(c\\) as a variable, but perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient as a number, meaning that the \\(c\\) terms must also be considered. Wait, that doesn't make sense because \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are different variables. So, perhaps the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which is 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would be a polynomial in \\(c\\), not a single number. So, maybe the problem is intended to have us consider only the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), meaning the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, and then multiply that by 6. That would give a numerical coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\). Let me check that approach. So, first, find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6. Then, find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because that would be the constant term, which doesn't affect the exponent of \\(c\\). Then, multiply those two coefficients together to get the final coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product. That seems plausible. So, let me calculate the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We want the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, so 6 - 2k = 0. Solving for k: 6 = 2k => k = 3. So, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 * 20 = 120. Wait, but earlier I thought it might be 384, but now I'm getting 120. I think I made a mistake earlier when I considered multiplying by the sum of coefficients, which is 64. But actually, if we're looking for the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, that's the only term that would contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms. So, the correct approach is to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion and multiply it by the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion. Therefore, 6 * 20 = 120. So, the coefficient is 120.\n\nWait, but let me make sure. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, meaning that the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which would be a polynomial. But since the problem is asking for a coefficient, which is a number, I think it's more likely that they want the coefficient when considering only the constant term in \\(c\\). So, 120 is the correct answer.\n\nSo, to recap:\n\n1. Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6.\n\n2. Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem. The coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20.\n\n3.

So, maybe I don't need to worry about the \\(c\\) terms when finding the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\). Let me think. The entire expression is the product of two expansions: \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when you multiply them together, each term from the first expansion will multiply each term from the second expansion. But since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are in one part and \\(c\\) is in the other, the coefficients for \\(a^2b^2\\) will just be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, that doesn't make sense because when you multiply, the coefficients multiply. Wait, no, actually, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the first part, and the second part is multiplied as a whole. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion, which doesn't seem right. Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. Let me think again. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when you multiply these two expressions, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term from \\((a + b)^4\\), the corresponding term in the product would be \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by every term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). However, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but in the product, \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by terms involving \\(c\\). So, perhaps the question is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the powers of \\(c\\), or maybe it's only considering the coefficient in the context of the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms, treating \\(c\\) as separate. Hmm, maybe I should clarify. Wait, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, considering all the terms. But since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all the coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, that might not be correct. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is just to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, so the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by all possible terms from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would make the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) equal to 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which would mean that the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), not a single number. But the problem is asking for a coefficient, which is a number, so perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Wait, maybe the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, treating \\(c\\) as a variable, so the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by all the possible terms from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but the coefficient would then be a sum of terms involving \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for a coefficient, which is a number, so perhaps the problem is only considering the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), and then the entire second part is multiplied, but that doesn't make sense because the second part is a separate expansion. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) would be found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, if I take the coefficient 6 from the first part and multiply it by 64, I get 384. But that seems too straightforward, and I'm not sure if that's the correct approach. Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\) and is multiplied by each term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), so the coefficient would be 6 times each term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But then, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually be a polynomial in \\(c\\), not a single number. So, perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, meaning that we can treat the second part as a constant. Wait, but that doesn't make sense because \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is a variable expression, not a constant. Hmm, I'm getting confused. Maybe I should approach it differently. Let me think about the entire expression: \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When you expand this, each term in the expansion will be of the form \\(a^kb^{4 - k} \\times c^m \\times \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^n\\), where \\(k\\) ranges from 0 to 4, and \\(m + n = 6\\). So, the exponents of \\(c\\) will be \\(m - n\\), which can vary. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so we're looking for all terms where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2. That means \\(k = 2\\) because \\(a^2b^{4 - 2} = a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Now, this term will be multiplied by each term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product will be 6 times the sum of all coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, the total coefficient would be 6 * 64 = 384. But I'm not sure if this is correct because the problem might be asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without considering the \\(c\\) terms, which would make the coefficient just 6, but that seems too simple. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, which would indeed be 6 times the sum of all coefficients from the second part, which is 64, giving 384. Wait, but let me check that again. If I have \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), when I multiply them, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by every term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial in \\(c\\). However, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a number, not a polynomial. So, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Maybe the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable, but then the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\). Alternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), meaning that we're looking for the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\), which would be the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). That might make more sense. So, let me try that approach. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient would be 6 times the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Now, let me find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem, the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(1/c\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). The constant term occurs when the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which implies \\(k = 3\\). So, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 * 20 = 120. Wait, that seems more reasonable. So, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), meaning the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by the constant term in the second expansion. That would make sense, and the answer would be 120. Let me verify that again. The constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, which happens at \\(k = 3\\), giving \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Then, the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) for \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, so 6 * 20 = 120. Yes, that seems correct. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is found by first determining the coefficient in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplying it by the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20. Thus, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\boxed{120}"

    "text": " But wait, the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). That term is in the \\((a + b)^4\\) part, and the other part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\), maybe the other part just contributes a constant factor? Wait, no, because the entire expression is a product of two parts. So, when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), we need to consider how that term interacts with the other part. Wait, but \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), so when we multiply it by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), it's like multiplying by a polynomial in \\(c\\). But since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is independent of \\(c\\), perhaps we need to consider the term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) that is a constant term, i.e., the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. Because when we multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by that constant term, it will still be a term with \\(a^2b^2\\), but multiplied by that constant. So, maybe the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me check that. So, first, find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, as I found earlier. Then, find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me expand that part. Using the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, so we set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of 6 and 20, which is 120. Wait, but let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. Is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) affected by the other terms in the expansion? Or is it only the constant term that matters because \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\)? Let me think. When you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), you're effectively taking each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) and multiplying it by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the \\((a + b)^4\\) part, and it's multiplied by every term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), we need to find all the terms in the product that result in \\(a^2b^2\\) times a constant (i.e., \\(c^0\\)). So, yes, that would be the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient is indeed 6 * 20 = 120. So, I think that's the answer. Let me just recap to make sure I didn't miss anything. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Multiplying them gives 120, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120.

But we are only interested in the terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) appears, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms.

Wait, but that would mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't sound right because the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) would be when we set \\(c = 1\\), which gives us \\(2^6 = 64\\). So, would the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) be 6 * 64 = 384? That seems too straightforward. Wait, but maybe I'm misunderstanding. Let me think again. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2 each and the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out. Because in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term is of the form \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, the exponent of \\(c\\) in each term is \\(6 - 2k\\). To have \\(c^0\\), we need \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which implies \\(k = 3\\). So, the term where \\(c\\) cancels out is when \\(k = 3\\), and its coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, the entire expression's expansion would have terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\), which is just 1. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the coefficient from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) where \\(c^0\\) is selected. So that would be 6 * 20 = 120. Wait, but earlier I thought it might be 6 * 64, but that would be if we were considering all possible terms, but actually, since we're only interested in the term where \\(c^0\\) is present, we need to multiply only by that specific coefficient. So, that makes more sense. So, the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120. Let me verify this again. So, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. In \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\) because we need to choose 3 terms of \\(c\\) and 3 terms of \\(1/c\\), so \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, when we multiply the two expansions, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term of the second part, but only the term where \\(c^0\\) will contribute to the \\(a^2b^2\\) term without any \\(c\\) factors. So, the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120. Yeah, that seems correct. So, the final answer is 120.\n\nWait, hold on, let me make sure I didn't miss anything. So, when I expand \\((a + b)^4\\), I get terms like \\(a^4\\), \\(4a^3b\\), \\(6a^2b^2\\), \\(4ab^3\\), and \\(b^4\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6. Now, for \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the expansion is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^6 \\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - k} \\cdot (1/c)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^6 \\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, the exponents of \\(c\\) go from 6 down to -6 in steps of 2. The term where the exponent is 0 is when \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), so \\(k = 3\\). So, that term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}c^{0} = 20\\). Therefore, when we multiply the two expressions, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by 20, giving \\(6 * 20 = 120\\) as the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). Therefore, the coefficient is 120.\n\nWait, but is there a possibility that other terms could contribute to \\(a^2b^2\\) when multiplied by other terms from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\)? For example, if I have a term like \\(a^3b\\) from \\((a + b)^4\\), and I multiply it by a term from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) that has \\(c^{-1}\\), would that somehow contribute to \\(a^2b^2\\) when combined with another term? No, because when you multiply two terms, their variables combine additively. So, \\(a^3b \\cdot c^{-1}\\) would result in \\(a^3b c^{-1}\\), which doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) exponents. So, only the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion multiplied by the constant term from the second expansion will contribute to \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. All other terms would have different exponents for \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), so they wouldn't contribute to the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. Therefore, the coefficient is indeed 120.\n\nSo, to recap:\n\n1.

Wait, no, actually, the entire expression is the product of \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when you multiply these two, each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), we need to see how this term interacts with the other expansion. Wait, but \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), so maybe the terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) won't affect the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). So, perhaps the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that doesn't make sense because the product would involve all the terms. Wait, no, that's not right. Actually, when you multiply two expressions, each term from the first expression is multiplied by each term from the second expression. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients in the second part. Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by any term in the second expression, the \\(a^2b^2\\) part remains, and the other parts just add more variables. Wait, but no, that's not correct either. Because if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of what happens with \\(c\\), then the coefficient would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expression, each term contributes a coefficient, and since \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term, the total coefficient would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion. So, first, let me find the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). To find the sum of the coefficients, we can set \\(c = 1\\), because substituting \\(c = 1\\) makes each term equal to its coefficient. So, substituting \\(c = 1\\), we get \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 64 (from the second part), which is 6 * 64 = 384. Wait, but let me double-check that. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), the terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) don't affect the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion, which doesn't make sense because the expansion includes terms with \\(c\\). Wait, no, when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in one polynomial is multiplied by each term in the other polynomial. So, if I have \\( (a + b)^4 \\) and I expand it, each term like \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by every term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients of all terms in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), because each term in the second expansion contributes its coefficient to the product. So, that would be 6 * 64 = 384, as I thought earlier. But wait, another way to think about it is that the product of two expressions is such that each term from the first is multiplied by each term from the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expression is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expression times the sum of all coefficients in the second expression. So, that would indeed be 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, if I were to look for a term like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), then the coefficient would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^k\\) in the second expansion. But since the problem only asks for \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. So, I think that's the answer. But let me check again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. First, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Then, the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\(2^6 = 64\\). So, 6 * 64 = 384. Yeah, that seems right.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is found by first determining the coefficient in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplying it by the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 64. Therefore, the final coefficient is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n\\(\\boxed{384}\\)"

The second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), when expanded, would have terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), but since the problem is only about \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), maybe the \\(c\\) terms don't affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, no, that might not be right. Let me think again. The entire expression is a product of two expansions, so when you multiply them, each term from \\((a + b)^4\\) gets multiplied by each term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which comes from \\((a + b)^4\\), the other factors in the product involving \\(c\\) would just be multiplied by this coefficient. However, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product. Wait, but the product includes terms with \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), so maybe the question is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). Or perhaps it's asking for the coefficient when considering all possible terms, including those with \\(c\\). Hmm, maybe I need to clarify. The problem says: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, in the entire product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) can be multiplied by any term from the second expansion, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire second expansion, because when you multiply, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second. But wait, no, that can't be right because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a specific term in the first part, but when you multiply by the second part, which is a polynomial in \\(c\\), the coefficient would actually be the coefficient from the first part times the entire second expansion, but that would make the coefficient a polynomial, not a single number. Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me read the problem again. It says: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, perhaps they are treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable and are only concerned with the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). In that case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that doesn't make sense because the coefficient should be a number, not a polynomial. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some \\(k\\), but it's not specified. Wait, maybe I'm misinterpreting. Let me check the problem again: it's exactly as I wrote. So, maybe the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, so the coefficient would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, which seems odd. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, regardless of the powers of \\(c\\), meaning we're to sum over all possible terms involving \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by any power of \\(c\\). But that still would result in the coefficient being multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which would make the coefficient a polynomial, not a single number. Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me think differently. Perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) times the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are different variables, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that seems unlikely because then the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\), and the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, considering all possible terms, which would mean that the coefficient is the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would mean evaluating \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) at \\(c = 1\\) to get the sum of coefficients, and then multiplying by 6. Let me check that approach. If I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(1 + 1/1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, if I do that, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times 64, which is 384. But I'm not sure if that's the correct interpretation because the problem didn't specify to consider all coefficients or to evaluate at \\(c = 1\\). Alternatively, maybe the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of \\(c\\), which would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but that would make the coefficient a polynomial, which doesn't seem right. Wait, maybe I'm missing something. Let me try to think differently. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). When you expand this, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from \\((a + b)^4\\) would be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be \\(6\\) times the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that seems odd because the problem is asking for a coefficient, which is a number, not a polynomial. Maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable, so the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\).

Wait, maybe the problem is only considering the terms where \\(c\\) is raised to a certain power, but it's not specified. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is miswritten, and it's supposed to be in \\((a + b + c + 1/c)^4\\), but that's just a guess. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating and the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and the second part is a distractor. But that seems unlikely because the entire expression is given as a product. Hmm, perhaps I should proceed under the assumption that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when considering all possible terms, which would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of the coefficients of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). To find the sum of the coefficients of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), we can set \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of the coefficients is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times 64, which is 384. That seems plausible. Alternatively, maybe the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and the second part is irrelevant because \\(c\\) is another variable. But that seems unlikely because the problem includes both parts. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) or something like that, but it's not specified.

But the problem is asking for a coefficient, which is a number, so perhaps I'm misinterpreting the problem. Wait, maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating \\(c\\) as a variable, but only considering the term where the power of \\(c\\) is zero, i.e., the constant term. That would make sense because then the coefficient would be a number. So, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is the constant term in \\(c\\). So, in that case, I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times the constant term of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Let me check that approach. First, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, as I found earlier. Now, the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. To find that, I can use the binomial theorem again. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(1/c\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, the exponent of \\(c\\) is \\(6 - 2k\\). We need \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which implies \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire product is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). That makes sense because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, and if we're considering only the constant term in \\(c\\), then the coefficient is 120. Alternatively, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then it would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial, but that seems unlikely because the problem is asking for a coefficient, which is a number. Therefore, I think the correct interpretation is that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, considering only the constant term in \\(c\\), which is 120.\n\nWait, but let me make sure. The problem says: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" It doesn't specify anything about \\(c\\), so perhaps it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, which would include all possible powers of \\(c\\). But in that case, the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a coefficient, which is a number. Therefore, perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and the second part is a distraction.

Therefore, I think the most reasonable interpretation is that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, considering only the constant term in \\(c\\), which is 120. So, I think the answer is 120.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. Let's consider that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which is not a number. Therefore, the problem must be asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, considering only the constant term in \\(c\\), which is 120. Therefore, I think the correct answer is 120.\n\nWait, but let me make sure. Let's think about the entire product. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\) with coefficient 6. Then, when multiplied by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) will be multiplied by 6. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a number.

Therefore, I think the problem must be asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, considering only the constant term in \\(c\\), which is 120. So, I'll go with that.\n\nWait, but let me check another approach. Let's expand \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) and find its constant term. As I did earlier, the constant term is when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, which happens when \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times 20, which is 120. That makes sense because when you multiply the two expansions, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by the constant term from the second part, giving \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 120.\n\nWait, but let me make sure. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. If we consider that \\(c\\) is another variable, then the coefficient would be 6 times the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but that's a polynomial. However, if we're only interested in the term where the power of \\(c\\) is zero, then the coefficient is 120. Since the problem doesn't specify, perhaps the intended answer is 120, assuming that we're only considering the constant term in \\(c\\). Therefore, I think the answer is 120.\n\nWait, but let me check one more time. If I expand \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. Then, when multiplied by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by all the terms in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), resulting in \\(6 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which in this context would be the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) multiplied by 6. But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, which doesn't make sense. Therefore, perhaps the problem is miswritten, or I'm misinterpreting it. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, regardless of \\(c\\), which would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of the coefficients of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). The sum of the coefficients is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient would be \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). But that seems high. Alternatively, maybe the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and the second part is irrelevant.

So, I think that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just 6 times whatever the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because \\(c^0\\) would be 1, and when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), it would contribute to the term \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, is that right? Let me think again. So, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, when you multiply two polynomials, each term from the first polynomial gets multiplied by each term from the second. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and that term doesn't involve \\(c\\), we can consider that the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and when multiplied by the constant term (i.e., \\(c^0\\)) from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), that would give us the term \\(6 \\times\\) (constant term). So, I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Let me work on that. Again, using the binomial theorem, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(1/c\\right)^m\\). Simplifying that, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m} = \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We want the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero because that's the constant term. So, set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\) so \\(m = 3\\). So, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20. Now, going back to the original expression, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the constant term from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, that's 6 times 20, which is 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is found by first determining the coefficient in \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem, which is 6, and then multiplying it by the constant term (where \\(c^0\\)) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20. Thus, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\boxed{120}"

    "text": " But since we're only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), maybe the terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) don't affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)? Wait, no, that can't be right. Because when you multiply the two expansions together, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually be the coefficient from the first part, 6, multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, the problem is asking just for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When we multiply these two, each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by every term in the second expansion. But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\), maybe the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is just a scalar multiplier? Wait, no, that's not correct because the second part has variables, so the coefficient would actually involve the sum of all the terms in the second expansion. Wait, no, that doesn't make sense. Let me clarify. When you have two separate expressions multiplied together, like (X)(Y), the coefficient of a specific term in X times Y is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in X and Y. But in this case, the problem is only about the term \\(a^2b^2\\), and the other part is in terms of \\(c\\). So, perhaps the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is multiplied by the entire second part, so the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, that doesn't seem right because the second part isn't a scalar. Alternatively, maybe I'm supposed to consider that when multiplying the two expressions, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term is multiplied by every term in the second expansion, but since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), maybe it's just 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. But that seems a bit unclear. Wait, actually, let's think about it. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by every term in the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be \\(6 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. Hmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Wait, perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, so we need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some \\(k\\). But the problem doesn't specify any power of \\(c\\), so maybe it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), which would mean summing over all possible coefficients for \\(c\\) in that term. Alternatively, maybe the problem is just to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, considering the entire expansion, so that the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that seems odd. Let me think again. When you have two polynomials multiplied together, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum of the products of coefficients of terms whose variables multiply to give that specific term. But in this case, the first polynomial has variables \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the second has variables \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part doesn't interact with the \\(c\\) terms because they're separate variables. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the entire second part. But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which isn't a single number. Therefore, perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and the second part is just a separate factor. But that seems unlikely because the problem includes both parts. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, which would require multiplying the coefficients from both parts. Wait, but since the variables are different, maybe they're independent. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Because for each term in the second part, you have a term that, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), contributes to the coefficient. So, the sum of all coefficients in the second part is when you set \\(c = 1\\), because substituting \\(c = 1\\) into \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) gives the sum of the coefficients. Let me calculate that: when \\(c = 1\\), \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of all coefficients in the second part is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 (from the first part) times 64 (sum of coefficients in the second part), which is 6 * 64 = 384. Wait, but let me make sure that's correct. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 * (sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\)), which is 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, if the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without considering \\(c\\), then it's 6 times the entire expansion of the second part, which would mean the coefficient is 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would make the coefficient a polynomial in \\(c\\), which seems unlikely. So, I think the correct interpretation is that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, regardless of the powers of \\(c\\), which would be 6 * 64 = 384. Wait, but let me confirm this approach. Another way to think about it is that when you have two polynomials multiplied together, the coefficient of a term in one polynomial is multiplied by the entire other polynomial. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and when multiplied by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), it becomes 6 * \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 * \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But since the problem is asking for the coefficient, which is a numerical value, perhaps they want the sum of the coefficients of that term across all powers of \\(c\\). So, if I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\), so the coefficient would be 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it, and the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and the second part is just a separate factor, so the answer is 6. But that seems too simple, and the problem includes both parts. I think the correct approach is that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. Let me check this again. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6, and when multiplied by the entire second expansion, each term in the second expansion will contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. But since the problem doesn't specify any particular power of \\(c\\), it's considering all possible powers, so the coefficient is the sum of all possible coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by 6. So, the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is indeed 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 384.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break down the problem as follows:\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\), so its coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n\n2. **Consider the second part \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   The sum of all coefficients in this expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\):\n   \\[\n   \\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\n   \\]\n\n3. **Combine the results:**\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the product of the coefficients from both parts:\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 64 = 384\n   \\]\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{384}\\)."

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Perhaps the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, but only considering the \\(a^2b^2\\) term regardless of \\(c\\). But that doesn't make much sense because the coefficient would then be a polynomial in \\(c\\).

But that seems unlikely because the problem is presented as a single coefficient, not an expression. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me try to approach it differently. Let's first expand \\((a + b)^4\\) to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which we did and it's 6. Now, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when we multiply these two, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).

Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that can't be right because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, not an expression. Hmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me check if I have the problem correctly: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, perhaps the problem is expecting the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, meaning that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) would be found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, if I take 6 times 64, that would be 384. But I'm not sure if that's the correct approach because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term in the product, but without any condition on \\(c\\). Alternatively, perhaps the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, so the coefficient would be 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).

So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 6 times \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a sum of terms involving \\(c^{6 - 2k}\\), which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient.

Maybe the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), so the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). As I thought earlier, the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\(2^6 = 64\\). So, 6 times 64 is 384. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 384. But wait, let me verify that. If I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = (1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, \\((a + b)^4 \\times 64\\) would give \\(64(a + b)^4\\). Then, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in that would be 64 times the coefficient in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, so 64 * 6 = 384. That seems plausible. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it and the answer is simply 6, but that doesn't seem right because the entire expression includes the \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) part, which would affect the coefficient when multiplied. Wait, but actually, when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each polynomial. But in this case, we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which only comes from the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), and the entire second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), is multiplied by that term.

Therefore, I must be missing something. Wait, perhaps the problem is only considering the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, meaning that the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that's an expression, not a number. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some specific \\(k\\), but since it's not specified, maybe it's just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), which would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384. I think that's the right approach. So, to summarize: The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\(2^6 = 64\\).

But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second part. So, I need to find the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). How do I find that? Well, the sum of the coefficients in a polynomial is found by plugging in \\(c = 1\\). So, if I substitute \\(c = 1\\) into \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), I get \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of the coefficients in the second part is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 times 64, which is 384. Wait, but that seems high. Let me check again. Alternatively, maybe I'm making a mistake here. Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second polynomial, each term is a different power of \\(c\\). So, the product will have terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for various \\(k\\). But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in effect, the coefficient is 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient when considering \\(a^2b^2\\) irrespective of the \\(c\\) terms. So, yes, that would make sense. So, the coefficient is 384. Let me verify this. Alternatively, maybe I should consider the entire product and see if that's correct. So, expanding \\((a + b)^4\\) gives terms from \\(a^4\\) down to \\(b^4\\), with coefficients 1, 4, 6, 4, 1 respectively. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) has a coefficient of 6. The second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), when expanded, has terms from \\(c^6\\) down to \\(c^{-6}\\), each with their own coefficients. The sum of these coefficients is indeed 64, as calculated by substituting \\(c = 1\\). Therefore, when you multiply each term in the first expansion by each term in the second, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. So, that seems correct. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 384.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break down the problem as follows:\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\), so its coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n\n2. **Consider the second part \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   The sum of the coefficients in this expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\):\n   \\[\n   \\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\n   \\]\n\n3. **Combine the results:**\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficient from the first part and the sum of the coefficients from the second part:\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 64 = 384\n   \\]\n\n**Final Answer:** The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{384}\\)."

    "text": " But since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which only involves \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), maybe the terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) will just contribute a coefficient, but since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), perhaps the coefficient from the \\(c\\) part is just 1? Wait, that doesn't seem right. Wait, no, because the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, when we expand both parts, each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), maybe we need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) because \\(c^0\\) is 1, and that's the only term that won't affect the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. So, let me think. If I can find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), then when I multiply it by the \\(a^2b^2\\) term, it will just contribute that coefficient. So, how do I find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\)? Again, using the binomial theorem. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(1/c\\right)^m\\). Simplifying that, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m} = \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be 0, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Now, since the original expression is the product of \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second part. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), it will only be affected by the constant term (i.e., the term with \\(c^0\\)) in the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficients from each part, which is 6 (from \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\)) multiplied by 20 (from \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\)). So, 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient is 120.\n\nWait, but let me double-check that. So, I found that in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, and in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Since the two parts are multiplied together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by the constant term 20, so indeed, the coefficient becomes 6 * 20 = 120. That seems right. Alternatively, I could think of the entire expression as a product, and since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient is just the product of the coefficients from each part.

    "text": " But since we're only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), maybe the other part doesn't affect this term? Wait, no, actually, the entire expression is the product of these two expansions. So, perhaps the \\(c\\) terms might not interfere with the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. Let me think. When you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. But since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which only involves \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), perhaps we can treat the \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) part as a separate factor that doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) exponents. Wait, but actually, that's not correct because when you multiply, the entire term from the second expansion will be multiplied by the term from the first. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, maybe we can consider that the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) is just 6 times whatever the constant term is in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because when you multiply by the constant term, the \\(c\\) terms would disappear, leaving just the numerical coefficient. Wait, is that correct? Let me think again. Suppose we have \\((a + b)^4\\) times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is of the form \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\\), and each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is of the form \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, when we multiply these together, the term involving \\(a^2b^2\\) would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}a^2b^2\\) times the sum over all terms in the second expansion. But since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), we can consider that the \\(a^2b^2\\) term is multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that doesn't seem right because each term in the second expansion has different powers of \\(c\\), so when you multiply, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term would be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, each with their own coefficient and power of \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). Wait, no, actually, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me read the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, the expression is a product of two polynomials, one in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the other in \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, when you multiply them, the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from the terms involving \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because when you multiply, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second. But that would mean the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that doesn't make sense because the coefficients in the second expansion depend on the powers of \\(c\\). Alternatively, perhaps the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is simply 6, because the other part doesn't affect it. Wait, no, that can't be right because the entire product would have terms where each \\(a^2b^2\\) term is multiplied by each term from the second expansion. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so perhaps we're supposed to treat \\(c\\) as a variable independent of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), so the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. But that seems too large. Alternatively, maybe the coefficient is just 6, because the other part doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. Wait, I'm confused. Let me think differently. Let's consider that the product is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). When we expand this, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, each of which is of the form \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But that would mean the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the entire expansion of the second part, which is not possible because coefficients are scalars. Wait, no, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the sum over all possible products where the term from the first expansion is \\(a^2b^2\\) and the term from the second expansion is any term, but since we're only interested in the coefficient, perhaps it's 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. Wait, the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion is when we set \\(c = 1\\), so \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times 64, which is 384. But that seems high. Alternatively, maybe I'm supposed to consider that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just 6, and the rest doesn't matter because the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. Wait, but that doesn't make sense because the entire expression is a product, so each term in the product would have both \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) parts and \\(c\\) parts. So, perhaps the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, and the \\(c\\) terms would be part of other terms, but since we're only asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) exponents, it's just 6. Wait, but that seems too simple. Let me check. Let me think of a simpler example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Expanding this, we get \\((a^2 + 2ab + b^2)(c + 1/c)\\). The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be zero because \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't appear in the expansion. Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, in this case, the expansion would have terms like \\(a^2c\\), \\(a^2 \\times 1/c\\), \\(2ab \\times c\\), \\(2ab \\times 1/c\\), etc. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would require multiplying \\(a^2\\) by \\(b^2\\), but in the first expansion, the highest power of \\(b\\) is 2, but to get \\(a^2b^2\\), you need to multiply \\(a^2\\) from the first term by \\(b^2\\) from the second term, but in the second expansion, there's no \\(b^2\\) term. Wait, maybe I'm getting confused because \\(c\\) is a different variable. So, in the original problem, the variables are separate. So, in the product, the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms are separate from the \\(c\\) terms. So, when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms are multiplied by the \\(c\\) terms, but since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that can't be right because the coefficient should be a number, not a polynomial. Wait, I think I'm mixing up the concepts. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Because when you multiply, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. The sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), so it's \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient would be 6 * 64 = 384. But wait, that seems too large. Let me think again. Alternatively, perhaps the coefficient is just 6 because the other part doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. But that doesn't seem right because the entire product includes all combinations of \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) terms. Wait, but the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, in other words, we're looking for all terms in the product that have \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by any power of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial, not a scalar. That can't be right because the coefficient should be a number. Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question. Maybe it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating \\(c\\) as a variable, so the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't make sense because coefficients are scalars. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), meaning the constant term in \\(c\\). So, perhaps we need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\) in the product. That would make sense. So, let's reinterpret the problem as finding the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). That would be more precise. So, in that case, we need to find the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, first, find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Let's expand that using the binomial theorem. \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(1/c\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). The constant term occurs when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which implies \\(m = 3\\). So, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 20 = 120. So, the coefficient is 120. Wait, that makes sense. So, the problem was asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but in the context of the entire expression, which includes \\(c\\) terms. So, to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), we need to consider that each term in the product will have both \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) exponents and \\(c\\) exponents. But if the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), irrespective of the \\(c\\) exponents, then the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. But that seems too large, and I think the intended interpretation is that the coefficient is for the term \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the constant term in \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient is 120. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, meaning that it's 6 times the entire expansion of the second part. But that would make the coefficient a polynomial, which doesn't make sense. Therefore, I think the intended interpretation is that the coefficient is for the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2 and 2, respectively, and the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. So, the coefficient is 120. Let me confirm this by considering the expansions. So, \\((a + b)^4\\) expands to \\(a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. Now, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) expands to \\(c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15/c^2 + 6/c^4 + 1/c^6\\). The constant term is 20. So, when we multiply these two expansions, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) would be 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, considering only the constant term in \\(c\\), is 120. So, I think that's the answer.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Next, we find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which occurs when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. This happens when \\(m = 3\\) in the binomial expansion, giving \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying these results gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\boxed{120}."

So, maybe the coefficient remains 6, regardless of the other part? Wait, but I'm not sure. Let me think again. So, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When you multiply two expressions, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which comes from the first part, and the second part is multiplied by it, but \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), so when we multiply, the terms involving \\(c\\) would just be multiplied by 1, or do they affect it? Wait, no, because \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term from the first part, and when you multiply by the second part, which is a polynomial in \\(c\\), each term would have \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by some power of \\(c\\).

So, to get the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) and then multiply it by 6. So, first, let me find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Again, I can use the binomial theorem for this. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(1/c\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). The constant term is when the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0. So, \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which implies \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Wait, let me just check if I did everything correctly. So, \\((a + b)^4\\) gives me a coefficient of 6 for \\(a^2b^2\\), and the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 20, so when I multiply them, it's 6 * 20 = 120. Yeah, that seems right.

    "text": " But wait, the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Does that mean I don't need to consider the \\(c\\) terms? Hmm, maybe not, because \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\). So, when we multiply the two expressions, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since we're only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), that term must come from the product of the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in \\((a + b)^4\\) and the constant term (the term with \\(c^0\\)) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because any other term involving \\(c\\) would introduce a \\(c\\) term into the product, which we don't want since we're only interested in the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. So, that means the coefficient we're looking for is 6 (from the \\(a^2b^2\\) term) multiplied by the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Now, I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Again, using the binomial theorem, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying each term: \\(c^{6 - m} \\times c^{-m} = c^{6 - 2m}\\). We want the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, because that's the constant term. So, set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\): \\(6 = 2m\\) \u2192 \\(m = 3\\). So, the constant term is when \\(m = 3\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Wait, let me double-check that. So, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, and in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the constant term is 20.

    "text": " But wait, since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is in the first part, and the second part involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), I think the second part doesn't affect the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). So, maybe the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just 6 multiplied by the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), perhaps the second part can be considered as a constant factor. Wait, but no, that's not quite right because the entire expression is a product, so maybe I need to consider how the terms combine. Wait, actually, no, because \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), so when you multiply the two expressions, the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are independent of the terms involving \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be 6 times whatever the constant term is in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because when you multiply by 1 (the constant term), it doesn't change the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. Alternatively, maybe the entire second part doesn't affect the \\(a^2b^2\\) term at all because it's multiplied by something else. Wait, no, that can't be right because the problem is asking for the coefficient in the product, so perhaps I need to consider that the second part could contribute to the overall coefficient, but since it's multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), perhaps the second part can be any term, but since we're only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), we can take the coefficient from the first part and multiply it by the entire expansion of the second part, but that seems complicated. Alternatively, maybe the second part's expansion doesn't affect the \\(a^2b^2\\) term because they're separate variables. Wait, but the problem is written as \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), so when you expand both, you get terms that are products of terms from each expansion. So, for example, a term from the first expansion, say \\(a^2b^2\\), multiplied by a term from the second expansion, say \\(c^k \\cdot (1/c)^{6 - k}\\), which is \\(c^{2k - 6}\\). But since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), we need to consider all possible terms in the second expansion that, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), give a term that includes \\(a^2b^2\\). But wait, actually, no, because \\(a^2b^2\\) is separate from \\(c\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the sum of all coefficients in the second part, because when you multiply by each term in the second part, you're effectively scaling the \\(a^2b^2\\) term by each coefficient in the second expansion. Wait, but that can't be right because the second part is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which when expanded, has terms with different powers of \\(c\\), but when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), each term would be \\(a^2b^2 \\cdot c^k\\) or something like that. But the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so perhaps we're only considering the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, i.e., the constant term, because otherwise, the term would have a \\(c\\) component, which isn't part of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, maybe the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 times the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Let me check that. So, first, I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). The general term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\cdot (1/c)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We want the exponent of \\(c\\) to be zero, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which implies \\(k = 3\\). So, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\), which is 20. Therefore, the constant term is 20. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 (from the first part) times 20 (from the constant term in the second part), which is 6 * 20 = 120. Wait, but let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. Is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) just 6, and then multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part, or only by the constant term? Because when you multiply two polynomials, each term from the first polynomial is multiplied by each term from the second polynomial. So, in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) where \\(k\\) varies. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would only include the terms where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, i.e., the constant term in the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is indeed 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (the constant term from the second part), which is 120. So, I think that's the correct answer. Let me just recap to make sure I didn't skip any steps or make any errors. First, expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem and find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is 6. Then, expand \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) and find the constant term, which is 20. Multiply these two coefficients together to get 120. That seems correct. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we proceed as follows:\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term with \\(a^2b^2\\) occurs when \\(k = 2\\):\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\n   \\]\n   So, the coefficient is 6.\n\n2. **Find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   Using the binomial theorem:\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n   \\]\n   The constant term occurs when \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\):\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\n   \\]\n\n3. **Combine the coefficients:**\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the product of the coefficients from each part:\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 20 = 120\n   \\]\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

But actually, the second part doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be 6 times whatever the sum of the coefficients in the second part is.

So, perhaps I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. Then, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times that constant term. Let me calculate that. So, first, expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem. The general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\).

Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 times 20, which is 120. Wait, that makes sense. Because when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part is multiplied by the constant term from the second part, which is 20, so 6 times 20 is 120.

But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which implies that we're considering the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2 each, regardless of the exponents on \\(c\\). Wait, that can't be right because the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is being multiplied by terms from the second expansion, so the entire term would have \\(a^2b^2\\) times something with \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so perhaps it's considering only the part where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by the constant term in the second expansion. Because otherwise, the term would have \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2c^{-k}\\), but the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would then be the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion, because \\(a^2b^2\\) is being multiplied by each term in the second expansion. Wait, no, that's not correct. Let me clarify. The entire expression is a product of two polynomials: one in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the other in \\(c\\). So, when you multiply them, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. Therefore, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is multiplied by every term in the second part. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Because each term in the second part contributes a coefficient that, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), would give a term \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by some power of \\(c\\). But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\), we need to consider all terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present, which would be the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients from the second part. Wait, but that doesn't seem right because the second part is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), and its expansion will have terms with different powers of \\(c\\), but when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), each term would have a different power of \\(c\\). However, the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would mean that we're considering the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by 1, i.e., the constant term in the second expansion. Because otherwise, the term would have \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2c^{-k}\\), but the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) itself would require that the power of \\(c\\) is zero. So, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, but that's not standard. Usually, when you're asked for the coefficient of a specific term, you have to consider all variables. Wait, but the problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", which suggests that it's considering the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2 each, and the exponents of \\(c\\) can be anything. But that's not possible because in the expansion, each term would have specific exponents for each variable. So, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times any power of \\(c\\), but that's not standard. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which would mean that the coefficient is the same as the coefficient in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, the coefficients add up. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) times the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Let me check that logic. The sum of the coefficients in a polynomial is found by setting all variables to 1. So, for \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), setting \\(c = 1\\) gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of the coefficients is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). But wait, that seems too straightforward. Let me think again. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), i.e., the term where the exponents of \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are 2, 2, and 0 respectively. That would make more sense. So, in that case, we need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product. To do that, we can consider the product of the two expansions. So, from \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. From \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), we need the coefficient of \\(c^0\\), which is the constant term. Let me find that. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(1/c\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire product is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Wait, but the problem didn't specify \\(c^0\\), it just asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Hmm, this is confusing. Let me check the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" It doesn't mention \\(c\\), so maybe it's considering all possible powers of \\(c\\). But in that case, the coefficient would be the same as the coefficient in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. As I thought earlier, the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. But I'm not sure if that's the correct interpretation. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which would mean that for each term in the product, if it has \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) exponent, we sum their coefficients. But that would require considering all terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present, which would be the same as the coefficient in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of the second part. But that would make the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product equal to 6 times the entire expansion, which doesn't make sense because the expansion includes terms with different \\(c\\) exponents. I think the correct interpretation is that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 * 20 = 120. Let me verify that. So, in the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. In the second part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. When we multiply these two, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by 20, so the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120. Alternatively, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, then it would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. But I think the more likely interpretation is that it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. To confirm, let me think about how the product works. Each term in the product is of the form \\(a^{k}b^{4 - k} \\times c^{m}\\), where \\(k\\) ranges from 0 to 4 and \\(m\\) ranges from -6 to 6 in steps of 2. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\(k = 2\\), and to get the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\), we need to multiply it by the constant term from the second expansion, which is 20. Therefore, the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120. So, I think the answer is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Next, we find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying these together gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n$\\boxed{120}$"

Wait, is that right? Let me think again. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When we multiply these two, each term from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term from the second expansion. However, since we're only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term from the first expansion, and the second expansion involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), which are different variables, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be the same as in the first part, right? Because when you multiply by the second part, you're adding terms with different variables, but \\(a^2b^2\\) isn't affected by \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\). So, does that mean the coefficient remains 6? Wait, that seems too straightforward. Let me double-check. Alternatively, maybe I'm missing something because the problem includes both parts. Let me see: The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when you multiply these out, the terms in the product will be combinations of terms from each expansion. But since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are in the first part and \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) are in the second, the variables don't interfere with each other. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the entire second part. Wait, but that would mean the coefficient is 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that can't be right because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not a term that includes \\(c\\). So, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, considering all variables. But that seems odd because \\(a^2b^2\\) is separate from \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). Alternatively, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times some power of \\(c\\), but it's not specified. Wait, the problem just says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", so maybe it's considering the coefficient in the entire expansion, which would include terms with \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). But then, how does that work? Let me think again. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), so the coefficient would just be 6 times whatever the coefficient is for the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), because otherwise, the term would have \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\) multiplied in, which would make it not just \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, that might make sense. So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, I need to consider that the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part is multiplied by each term from the second part. But if I want the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms, I would need to find the term in the second expansion that is a constant, i.e., where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out. So, in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the constant term is the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. Let me find that. Using the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(1/c\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the exponent of \\(c\\) is \\(6 - 2m\\). We want this exponent to be zero for the constant term. So, \\(6 - 2m = 0\\) \u2192 \\(2m = 6\\) \u2192 \\(m = 3\\). So, the constant term is when \\(m = 3\\), and the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the constant term from the second part, which is 20. So, 6 \u00d7 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120. Wait, but let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. So, the first part gives me \\(a^2b^2\\) with coefficient 6, and the second part gives me a constant term 20. When I multiply these together, I get 6 \u00d7 20 = 120 as the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. That seems correct because the \\(c\\) terms would not affect the \\(a^2b^2\\) term unless we're considering specific powers of \\(c\\), but since the problem doesn't specify any \\(c\\) terms, it's just the coefficient when multiplied by the constant term.

Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again. It says: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" Oh, maybe I misread it. It's not asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or something like that. It's just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, in other words, when you expand the entire expression, collect all terms that have \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by any power of \\(c\\), and then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the sum of all the coefficients from those terms. Wait, no, actually, no. When you multiply two expressions, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, in this case, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the entire expansion of the second part. But that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial in \\(c\\), not a numerical coefficient. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which suggests that it's a numerical coefficient, not an expression involving \\(c\\). Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, in other words, when you multiply out the entire expression, any term that has \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by any power of \\(c\\) will contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). But that would mean that the coefficient is actually a sum of coefficients from the second expansion. Wait, no, because each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part, which is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be \\(6 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that's not a numerical coefficient; it's a polynomial in \\(c\\). Therefore, maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, so the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\). But that seems odd because the problem didn't specify. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is miswritten, and it should be asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) or something like that, to have a specific power of \\(c\\). Alternatively, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which would be \\(6 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't seem right because the coefficient should be a number, not an expression involving \\(c\\). Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the question. Let me check again. The problem says: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, perhaps the question is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when the entire expression is expanded, considering all variables. But that would mean that the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\), which is not typical. Usually, when you're asked for the coefficient of a term in a product of expressions, you consider the variables separately. So, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable, so the coefficient would be the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems odd. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, ignoring the \\(c\\) terms, which would mean that the coefficient is 6, as that's the coefficient from the first part, and the second part is just a multiplier. But that doesn't make sense because the second part is an expansion that includes various powers of \\(c\\). Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), i.e., the constant term with respect to \\(c\\). So, the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2, and the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out to zero. That might make sense. So, in that case, we would need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, first, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, as we found earlier. Then, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is the middle term of that expansion. Let me calculate that. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) can be done using the binomial theorem. The general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be zero, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(k = 3\\). So, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. So, putting it all together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire expression is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120. Wait, but the problem didn't specify \\(c^0\\), so maybe I'm overcomplicating it again. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which would mean that it's 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which would be a polynomial in \\(c\\). But that seems unlikely because the problem probably expects a numerical coefficient. So, maybe the correct interpretation is that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), which is 120. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is miswritten, and it's supposed to be \\((a + b + c)^4\\) or something else, but given the problem as stated, I think the intended answer is 120, considering the constant term in \\(c\\). So, to recap: The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Multiplying these together gives 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is found using the binomial theorem, which gives \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). \n\nNext, we consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem, the general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). To find the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, we solve \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), giving \\(k = 3\\). The coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n\nMultiplying these coefficients together, we get \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\boxed{120}."

So, perhaps the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the entire second part, because when you multiply by the second part, it's like you're adding more terms, but \\(a^2b^2\\) is only from the first part. Wait, no, that might not be right. Let me think again. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when you expand this product, you're taking each term from \\((a + b)^4\\) and multiplying it by each term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term that comes only from \\((a + b)^4\\), right? Because the second part doesn't have \\(a\\) or \\(b\\) terms. So, when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term from the second part, you'll get terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2 \\dfrac{1}{c^k}\\), but none of these will be just \\(a^2b^2\\). So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), because when you multiply by the second part, you don't get any new terms that are just \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient is 6. But wait, that seems too straightforward. Let me double-check. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the powers of \\(c\\), but that doesn't make much sense because \\(a^2b^2\\) isn't multiplied by any \\(c\\) terms. Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think again. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When you expand this, you get a sum of terms, each term being a product of a term from the first expansion and a term from the second expansion. So, each term will have the form \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}a^{4 - k}b^k \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - m}\\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\), which simplifies to \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}\\dbinom{6}{m}a^{4 - k}b^k c^{6 - 2m}\\). Now, if we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), we need to find all terms where \\(a^{4 - k}b^k = a^2b^2\\). That requires \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\), so \\(k = 2\\). Now, for each such term, the exponent of \\(c\\) will be \\(6 - 2m\\). But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), we can sum over all possible \\(m\\) values, because each term with \\(a^2b^2\\) will have different powers of \\(c\\), but the coefficient for each of those terms will be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\dbinom{6}{m}\\). Wait, no, that's not correct. Because the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be the sum of the coefficients from each term that has \\(a^2b^2\\). But actually, no, because each term in the product is a separate term. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^{6 - 2m}\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\dbinom{6}{m}\\). But if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), then it's actually the sum over all \\(m\\) of \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\dbinom{6}{m}\\). Wait, that can't be right because each term has a different power of \\(c\\). So, perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, meaning that it's the sum of all coefficients where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present, regardless of the \\(c\\) part. But that would mean that the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) multiplied by the sum of \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\) over all \\(m\\). But the sum of \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\) from \\(m = 0\\) to \\(6\\) is \\(2^6 = 64\\). So, the coefficient would be \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). But that seems high. Wait, no, because each term in the product is a separate term, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) times the entire second expansion, because when you multiply, each term from the first part is multiplied by each term from the second part. But if we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, then it's the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is \\(2^6 = 64\\). So, that would make the coefficient \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). But wait, I'm not sure if that's the correct interpretation. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), meaning the term where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out. So, in that case, we need \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which gives \\(m = 3\\). So, the coefficient would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Let me compute that: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\), and \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, 6 times 20 is 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is 120. But the problem didn't specify anything about \\(c\\), just \\(a^2b^2\\). Hmm, so I'm a bit confused. Let me read the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, which includes all terms. But \\(a^2b^2\\) is present in the product as \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by each term from the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually be the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the entire second expansion. Wait, but that doesn't make sense because the second expansion is a polynomial in \\(c\\), and when you multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), it becomes a term with \\(a^2b^2\\) times each power of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is just the coefficient from the first part, because the second part is a separate variable. So, maybe the coefficient is just 6. But that seems too simple, and I'm probably missing something. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the entire expression as a single polynomial, and \\(a^2b^2\\) can appear with different powers of \\(c\\), but the coefficient would be the same as in the first part. Wait, no, because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term from the second expansion, each of those terms would have a different coefficient. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, because the second part is multiplied by it, but since it's a separate variable, the coefficient doesn't change. Wait, that doesn't make sense. Let me think differently. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^4 = A\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = B\\). Then the product is \\(A \\times B\\). The term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(A\\) is \\(6a^2b^2\\). When I multiply this by \\(B\\), I get \\(6a^2b^2 \\times B\\). So, in the product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be present multiplied by each term in \\(B\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(A\\) times the entire \\(B\\), which is 6 times \\(B\\). But since \\(B\\) is a sum of terms involving \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is actually 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(B\\), which is 6 times \\(2^6 = 6 \\times 64 = 384\\). But that seems like a lot. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(B\\), which is 384. But I'm not sure if that's the intended interpretation. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which would mean that we're considering the entire expression as a polynomial in \\(a, b, c\\), and we're looking for the coefficient of the term \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for any \\(k\\). But that's not what the problem says. It just says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", which is ambiguous. But in the context, perhaps it's referring to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which would be the sum over all \\(k\\) of the coefficients of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\). In that case, it would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(B\\), which is 6 times 64, so 384. Alternatively, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where \\(c\\) cancels out, then we need to find the coefficient where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. So, in the second expansion, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term with \\(c^0\\) is when the exponent is zero, which occurs when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), so \\(m = 3\\). The coefficient for that term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). So, depending on the interpretation, the answer could be either 6, 120, or 384. But I think the most likely intended interpretation is that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. Because if it were asking for the coefficient regardless of \\(c\\), it would probably specify that it's considering all terms, which is not typical. So, I think the answer is 120.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break down the problem as follows:\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\)** using the binomial theorem:\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term containing \\(a^2b^2\\) occurs when \\(k = 2\\):\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\n   \\]\n   So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\n2. **Consider the second part \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)**:\n   We need to find the term that, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), results in a term with \\(a^2b^2\\) and no \\(c\\) terms.

    "text": " But wait, the question is about the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Since the other part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which involves \\(c\\) terms, but we're only interested in \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\). So, does that mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)? Wait, no, that doesn't seem right. Because when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second. But since we're only interested in \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term in the first polynomial, and the second polynomial is in terms of \\(c\\), which is a different variable. So, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the product will be the product of the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part and the entire expansion of the second part. But wait, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so that would be the coefficient from the first part times the entire second part. But no, that can't be right because the second part is a separate variable. Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, when we expand this product, each term from \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by every term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But wait, that would mean the coefficient is 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial in \\(c\\), but the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Wait, no, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. But wait, no, that's not correct because each term in the second expansion is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), so the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. But let me check that. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, which would include all possible combinations of \\(c\\) terms. But since the problem doesn't specify any particular term involving \\(c\\), maybe it's just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Wait, but the sum of all coefficients in a polynomial is found by setting all variables to 1. So, if I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(1 + 1/1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 * 64 = 384. But wait, that seems too straightforward. Let me double-check. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. That is, the term where \\(c\\) cancels out. Because in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - k} \\times (1/c)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, the exponent of \\(c\\) is \\(6 - 2k\\). To have \\(c^0\\), we set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\). So, the term where \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}c^0 = 20\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) would be 6 * 20 = 120. But wait, the problem didn't specify anything about \\(c\\), so maybe it's just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384. But that seems a bit odd because the problem is asking for a specific term in a product, but if it's not specifying any \\(c\\) terms, perhaps it's just 6. Wait, no, that doesn't make sense because the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), so when you multiply, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) expansion. But that would make the coefficient a polynomial in \\(c\\), which isn't what the problem is asking. So, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but without considering the \\(c\\) terms. So, in other words, it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). In that case, the coefficient would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). As I calculated before, the sum of coefficients is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be 6 * 20 = 120. I think the problem is more likely asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), so the answer would be 384. But to be sure, let me go through it again. The problem says: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\).\" So, in the product, each term is of the form \\(a^kb^{4 - k}c^m\\), where \\(k\\) ranges from 0 to 4, and \\(m\\) depends on the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which implies that we're looking for all terms where \\(a\\) is squared and \\(b\\) is squared, regardless of the power of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would make the coefficient a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. Therefore, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where \\(c\\) is raised to the zero power. So, in that case, we need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). As I calculated earlier, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) would be 6 * 20 = 120. That makes more sense because it's a specific term in the expansion. So, I think the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, i.e., the constant term in \\(c\\). Therefore, the answer would be 120. Let me just confirm that. So, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. In \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, when you multiply these two, you get 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, considering only the constant term in \\(c\\), is 120. So, I think that's the answer.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break down the problem into two parts:\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term containing \\(a^2b^2\\) occurs when \\(k = 2\\):\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\n   \\]\n   So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\n2. **Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) and find the constant term (coefficient of \\(c^0\\)):**\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n   \\]\n   To find the constant term (\\(c^0\\)), set the exponent equal to zero:\n   \\[\n   6 - 2m = 0 \\implies m = 3\n   \\]\n   The constant term is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\n   \\]\n\n3. **Combine the results:**\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficients from each part:\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 20 = 120\n   \\]\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{120}"

    "text": " But since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which only involves \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), the terms from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) will just contribute a constant factor, right? Because \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), so when we multiply, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times whatever the constant term is in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but actually, is that correct? Let me think again. When you multiply two expressions together, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression. So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I need to take the term with \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part and multiply it by the entire second part, but since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term without \\(c\\), it will only contribute when multiplied by the constant term (i.e., the term with \\(c^0\\)) in the second expression. So, I think I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), and then multiply it by 6 to get the final coefficient. So, let's find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Again, using the binomial theorem: \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying each term: \\(c^{6 - m} \\times \\dfrac{1}{c^m} = c^{6 - 2m}\\). We want the exponent of \\(c\\) to be zero because that's the constant term. So, we set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is when \\(m = 3\\), and the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the two coefficients we found: 6 (from the first part) times 20 (from the second part). Let me calculate that: 6 * 20 = 120. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) should be 120. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let me double-check each step. First, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Then, in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we found the constant term by setting the exponent to zero, which gave \\(m = 3\\), and the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying them together gives 6 * 20 = 120. Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe I can think of it as the entire expression being the product of two independent expansions, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times the constant term in the other expansion. So yes, 6 * 20 = 120.

    "text": " But wait, the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, maybe the terms involving \\(c\\) don't affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)? Let me think. Since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\), and then we're multiplying by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a separate expansion. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product. Wait, does that mean I need to consider how the other terms interact? Or is it just the coefficient from the first part, and the second part contributes a factor that doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms? Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me consider the entire expression: \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When I expand this, each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which comes from the first part, and the second part doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), maybe the coefficient remains the same? Wait, that doesn't sound right. Because when you multiply by the second expression, you're effectively scaling each term in the first expansion by the entire expansion of the second. But wait, no, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, but since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is if we take the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part and multiply it by the constant term (the term with \\(c^0\\)) from the second part. Because any other term in the second expansion would have a \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\) factor, which would introduce a \\(c\\) term into the product, making it not just \\(a^2b^2\\). So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let's work on that. Again, using the binomial theorem, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying that, each term becomes \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m} = \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, because that's the constant term. So, we set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20. Now, going back to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficients from each part. That is, 6 (from \\((a + b)^4\\)) multiplied by 20 (from the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)). So, 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120.\n\nWait, let me just double-check that. So, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6, correct. Then, in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the constant term is when the exponent is 0, which occurs at m=3, giving \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, when we multiply the two expansions together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second part, but only the constant term (20) will result in a term that's just \\(a^2b^2\\). All other terms would introduce \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), which we don't want. So, the coefficient is indeed 6 * 20 = 120. I think that's correct.\n\nAnother way to think about it is that the entire expression is a product of two polynomials. When you multiply them, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum of the products of coefficients of terms in each polynomial that multiply together to give that specific term. In this case, since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) is by multiplying the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first polynomial by the constant term from the second polynomial. So, it's just 6 * 20 = 120. Yep, that seems right.\n\nI don't think I made any mistakes in the calculations. The binomial coefficients were calculated correctly, and the logic about how the terms multiply seems solid. So, I'm confident the coefficient is 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem.\n\nFirst, we expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n\\]\nWe need the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which corresponds to \\(k = 2\\):\n\\[\n\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\n\\]\n\nNext, we consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem:\n\\[\n\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n\\]\nWe need the constant term (where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0):\n\\[\n6 - 2m = 0 \\implies m = 3\n\\]\nThe constant term is:\n\\[\n\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\n\\]\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficients from each part:\n\\[\n6 \\times 20 = 120\n\\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}."

    "text": " But wait, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), so when I multiply the two expansions together, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be the coefficient from the first part times the expansion of the second part evaluated at the term that doesn't affect \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). Wait, but actually, since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would just come from the product of the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in \\((a + b)^4\\) and the constant term (with respect to \\(c\\)) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because when you multiply terms, the variables have to match. So, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term comes only when you take \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part and multiply it by something that doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), which would be the constant term in the second part. So, I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me think about that. Again, using the binomial theorem, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying that, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m} = \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the exponent on \\(c\\) is \\(6 - 2m\\). We want the term where the exponent is zero because that's the constant term. So, set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which gives \\(m = 3\\). So, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20. Therefore, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficients from each part, which is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Wait, let me double-check that. So, the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) for \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, and the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Since these two are multiplied together in the overall expression, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6 times 20, which is 120. I don't think I made any mistakes here. Wait, just to be thorough, let me make sure that when I expand both parts, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term is only affected by the constant term in the second part. Because any other term in the second part would have a \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\) component, which would make the entire term have \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), but since we're only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), those terms wouldn't contribute because they would bring along extra variables. So, yes, only the constant term in the second part affects the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, I think my answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.

Wait, but let me think carefully. So, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). If I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), that term would be 6 times the entire \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) expansion. But wait, no, that's not quite right. Because when you multiply two expressions together, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part would be multiplied by each term in the second part. But since the second part is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which expands to terms involving \\(c^6\\), \\(c^4\\), \\(c^2\\), \\(c^0\\), \\(c^{-2}\\), \\(c^{-4}\\), \\(c^{-6}\\), each multiplied by their respective coefficients. But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), maybe I just need to consider the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, and then the entire expansion of the second part would just be a scalar multiple. Wait, that might not be correct. Wait, no, because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), you get \\(a^2b^2\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), perhaps it's considering the term regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. Wait, but that doesn't make sense because the entire expression is a product. So, perhaps the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would just be the coefficient from the first part, 6, multiplied by the entire second expansion, but that doesn't seem right either. Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think again. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are in the first part, and \\(c\\) is in the second, when you multiply them, the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from those involving \\(c\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by every term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), perhaps the coefficient is just 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. Hmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Wait, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, considering all possible terms, including those with \\(c\\). But that seems unlikely because \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\). Wait, no, the entire expression is a product, so when you expand it, you'll have terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for different values of \\(k\\), but the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would be the sum of all the coefficients of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for all \\(k\\). So, that would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Wait, but the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 * 64 = 384. But wait, that seems too straightforward. Let me check that again. Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just 6, and the rest of the terms involving \\(c\\) would be part of the other terms in the expansion. But the problem is specifically asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would include all the terms where \\(a\\) is squared and \\(b\\) is squared, regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would indeed be 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384. Wait, but let me think again. When you expand \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part (which is 6) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Since the sum of coefficients in the second part is found by substituting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\(2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the total coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384. So, I think that's the answer. But let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without considering the \\(c\\) terms, but that doesn't make much sense because the entire expression includes \\(c\\). Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), but it's not specified. Hmm. Wait, the problem says: \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\". So, perhaps it's considering the term \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, that would mean that for each term in the expansion, if it has \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of what power of \\(c\\) it has, we include its coefficient. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the sum over all possible \\(c\\) exponents of the coefficients from the product. So, that would be the coefficient from the first part (6) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which is 64, giving 384. So, I think that's correct. Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms, but that would require the \\(c\\) terms to cancel out, which they don't. So, I think the correct approach is to multiply the coefficient from the first part by the sum of coefficients from the second part, giving 384. Let me just check that again. The first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), gives \\(a^2b^2\\) with coefficient 6. The second part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), when expanded, has terms like \\(c^6\\), \\(6c^4\\), \\(15c^2\\), \\(20\\), \\(15c^{-2}\\), \\(6c^{-4}\\), \\(c^{-6}\\). The sum of all coefficients is \\(2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, when you multiply 6 by each of these terms, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times each coefficient in the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^6\\) would be 6 * 1 = 6, \\(a^2b^2c^4\\) would be 6 * 6 = 36, \\(a^2b^2c^2\\) would be 6 * 15 = 90, \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) would be 6 * 20 = 120, and so on. So, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then it's the sum of all these coefficients, which is 6 + 36 + 90 + 120 + 90 + 36 + 6. Let me calculate that: 6 + 36 is 42, plus 90 is 132, plus 120 is 252, plus 90 is 342, plus 36 is 378, plus 6 is 384. So, that's consistent with my earlier calculation. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 384. So, I think that's the answer.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplying it by the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is \\(2^6 = 64\\). Thus, the total coefficient is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{384}."

Wait, no, that's not quite right. The entire expression is the product of two parts, so when you multiply them, each term in the first expansion gets multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are only in the first part, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term would come from the first part, and the second part would contribute a term that's multiplied by it.

Wait, no, that can't be right because the second part has terms with \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), so when you multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), each term in the second expansion would create a term like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2/c^k\\), but the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of what's happening with \\(c\\). So, does that mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just the coefficient from the first part, multiplied by the entire second expansion's sum? Wait, no, that can't be right because each term in the product would be a combination of terms from both expansions. So, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of the other variables, which would mean that the coefficient is the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients from the second part, because each term in the second part is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\).

So, the sum of the coefficients in the second part is when \\(c = 1\\), so substituting \\(c = 1\\) into the second part gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of the coefficients is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the sum of the coefficients from the second part, which is 64. So, 6 times 64 is 384. Therefore, the coefficient is 384.\n\nWait, but let me check that again. Alternatively, maybe I should consider that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just 6, because the other part doesn't affect it. But that doesn't make sense because when you multiply two expressions, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 multiplied by the entire second expression, but since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the other variables, it's actually 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which is 64, so 6*64=384. That seems correct.\n\nWait, but another way to think about it is that when you multiply two expressions, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each expression. So, in this case, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\), and it's multiplied by every term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient from the first part, 6, multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which is 64, giving 384.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider that the second part doesn't affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but that's not true because when you multiply, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second part, which is 64. So, 6*64=384.\n\nWait, let me make sure. Let's think of it as two separate expansions:\n\nFirst, \\((a + b)^4\\) expands to terms with \\(a^4, a^3b, a^2b^2, ab^3, b^4\\), with coefficients 1, 4, 6, 4, 1 respectively.\n\nSecond, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) expands to terms with \\(c^6, 6c^4, 15c^2, 20, 15/c^2, 6/c^4, 1/c^6\\).\n\nNow, when we multiply these two expansions, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(6a^2b^2c^4\\), etc. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). Wait, that can't be right because \\(a^2b^2\\) would only be present if it's multiplied by the constant term in the second expansion, which is 20. Because if you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by \\(c^k\\) or \\(1/c^k\\), you get \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2/c^k\\), but not just \\(a^2b^2\\) unless \\(k=0\\). So, actually, the only term that would result in \\(a^2b^2\\) when multiplied is the term where the second part is 20, because that's the constant term. So, the coefficient would be 6 (from \\(a^2b^2\\)) multiplied by 20 (the constant term in the second expansion), giving 120.\n\nWait, that's different from what I thought earlier. So, I think I made a mistake earlier. The problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. So, when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will only combine with the term that's a constant in the second part to give a term that's just \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient would be 6 times the coefficient of the constant term in the second expansion.\n\nSo, let's recast that. The second expansion is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). The constant term occurs when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. So, in the expansion, the general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(1/c\\right)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We need \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), so \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of the constant term is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 (from the first part) times 20 (from the constant term in the second part), which is 120.\n\nWait, so earlier I thought it was 384, but now I'm getting 120. Which one is correct? Let me think again. The problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\). So, in the product, the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms is to multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first expansion by the constant term from the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient is indeed 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nSo, my initial approach was wrong because I thought the entire sum of coefficients from the second part was involved, but actually, only the constant term contributes to the \\(a^2b^2\\) term without any \\(c\\) factors. So, the correct coefficient is 120.\n\nLet me double-check this. So, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. In \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the constant term is 20. Therefore, when multiplied together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 * 20 = 120, and that's the only term that gives \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\) terms. So, yes, the coefficient is 120.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not missing anything. Suppose I expand both parts fully and look for the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. The first expansion gives \\(a^2b^2\\) as 6a\u00b2b\u00b2, and the second expansion gives terms with different powers of \\(c\\). When I multiply them, I get 6a\u00b2b\u00b2 * (c\u2076 + 6c\u2074 + 15c\u00b2 + 20 + 15/c\u00b2 + 6/c\u2074 + 1/c\u2076). So, the only term that doesn't involve \\(c\\) is 20, so 6a\u00b2b\u00b2 * 20 = 120a\u00b2b\u00b2. Therefore, the coefficient is 120.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So, the correct answer is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is found by considering the constant term in the second expansion, which is 20, and multiplying it by the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion, which is 6. Thus, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}."

So, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), which is 1. That would make the answer the product of the coefficients from each part. So, let me try that approach. First, find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which we already found to be 6. Next, find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Then, multiply those two coefficients together to get the final coefficient for the term \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). So, let's work on finding the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so we set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Now, multiplying the two coefficients together: 6 (from \\(a^2b^2\\)) times 20 (from \\(c^0\\)) equals 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake here. So, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). If we treat this as a product of two polynomials, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is multiplied by every term in the second part. But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), it's essentially asking for all terms in the product that have \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by any power of \\(c\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't seem right. Alternatively, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, that would mean summing over all possible coefficients from the \\(c\\) part, which would give a single number. But that approach doesn't seem correct either because each term would have a different power of \\(c\\). So, perhaps the problem is indeed asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\). That would make sense because then the coefficient would be a single number. Therefore, I think my approach is correct, and the final coefficient is 120. Let me just double-check my calculations. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). The coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying them together gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Yes, that seems right. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Next, we find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying these coefficients together gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\boxed{120}"

    "text": " But wait, the question is about the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, does that mean I need to consider how this second part affects the coefficient? Hmm, maybe not, because \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, perhaps the second part doesn't affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) because it's multiplied by terms involving \\(c\\). Wait, but I'm not sure. Let me think again. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when we expand this, each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But the problem is only asking about the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, if I'm looking for the term \\(a^2b^2\\), then in the product, this term will be multiplied by every term from the second expansion. But since the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, maybe I can treat the second part as a separate factor and just multiply the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) by the entire expansion of the second part. Wait, no, that doesn't sound right. Because when you multiply two polynomials, each term from the first polynomial is multiplied by each term from the second, and the coefficients get multiplied. So, in this case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that can't be, because then the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\), but the problem is just asking for a coefficient, not a polynomial. Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the question. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, perhaps the problem is considering the entire product, and it's looking for the coefficient of the term \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by some combination of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). But then, the problem doesn't specify any particular power of \\(c\\), so maybe it's just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). Wait, but that doesn't make much sense because then the coefficient would be a sum over all possible powers of \\(c\\). Alternatively, maybe the problem is actually a product of two separate expansions, and we're looking for the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any term from the second expansion. But then, the coefficient would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the entire second expansion, which would be a polynomial. But the problem is phrased as asking for the coefficient, so maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some \\(k\\), but it's not specified. Alternatively, maybe the problem is just considering the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without considering the \\(c\\) terms, which would be the case if we're treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable. Wait, but that would mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just 6, as we found earlier, and the rest of the terms involve \\(c\\), so the coefficient remains 6. But that seems too straightforward, and maybe I'm missing something. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting me to consider that the entire expression is a product, and we're looking for the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any term from the second expansion, so the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of the second part. But that doesn't make sense because the coefficient should be a number, not a polynomial. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when the entire expression is expanded, but without considering the \\(c\\) terms. So, in that case, the coefficient would just be 6, as the \\(c\\) terms are separate. But that seems a bit odd. Alternatively, perhaps I'm supposed to consider that the expression is a product, and when you expand it, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by all the terms from the second expansion, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a coefficient, implying a single number. Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try to think differently. Maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where the exponents of \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are 2, 2, and 0 respectively. That would make sense because then we're looking for a specific term in the expansion. So, if that's the case, then I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me try that approach. So, to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), I can consider the product of the expansions. The first expansion, \\((a + b)^4\\), gives terms like \\(a^2b^2\\) with coefficient 6, as we found. The second expansion, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), can be expanded using the binomial theorem as well. Let me write that out: \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, each term in this expansion is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). Now, when we multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2 \\times \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). But we're looking for the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Let's solve for \\(m\\): \\(6 - 2m = 0\\) \u2192 \\(2m = 6\\) \u2192 \\(m = 3\\). So, the term where \\(m = 3\\) will give us \\(c^0\\), which is 1. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is the product of the coefficients from both expansions. From the first expansion, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. From the second expansion, when \\(m = 3\\), the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Let me calculate that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120. Wait, but let me double-check that. So, the first part gives 6 for \\(a^2b^2\\), and the second part, when \\(m = 3\\), gives 20 for \\(c^0\\). So, when multiplied together, it's 6 * 20 = 120. That seems correct. Let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes in the binomial coefficients. For \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). For \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term where \\(c\\) cancels out (i.e., exponent 0) is when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), so \\(m = 3\\), and \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, multiplying 6 and 20 gives 120. Yeah, that seems right. So, I think the coefficient is 120.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\), so its coefficient is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\n   \\]\n\n2. **Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n   \\]\n   We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0:\n   \\[\n   6 - 2m = 0 \\implies m = 3\n   \\]\n   The coefficient for \\(m = 3\\) is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\n   \\]\n\n3. **Multiply the coefficients from both expansions:**\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 20 = 120\n   \\]\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

Therefore, when you multiply the two expressions, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second.

Wait, but that doesn't make sense because the second part is raised to the 6th power, which would have multiple terms. So, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Wait, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, if I consider the entire product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term from the second expansion, but since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term on its own, the coefficient would be the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients from the second part. Wait, but that can't be right because the second part is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which when expanded, has terms like \\(c^6\\), \\(6c^4\\), etc. So, each term from the first expansion is multiplied by each term from the second expansion.

Wait, but that's not correct because each term in the second expansion is a different power of \\(c\\), so when you multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), you get terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(6a^2b^2c^4\\), etc. So, in the entire product, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just the coefficient from the first part, because when you multiply by the second part, you're introducing other variables, but \\(a^2b^2\\) remains as a term multiplied by various powers of \\(c\\).

Since the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and the second part doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be 6, because the second part is multiplied by all terms, but \\(a^2b^2\\) is just one term, so its coefficient remains 6 regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. Wait, but that doesn't seem right because when you multiply, each term from the first expansion is multiplied by each term from the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion.

But since \\(a^2b^2\\) is only from the first part, and the second part is multiplied by it, the coefficient would indeed be 6 times the sum of coefficients from the second part, which is 6 * 64 = 384. Wait, but let me make sure. Let me think of a simpler case. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, the expansion would be \\((a^2 + 2ab + b^2)(c + 1/c)\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually be zero because \\(a^2\\) is only multiplied by \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), but \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't appear unless you have terms where \\(a^2\\) is multiplied by \\(b^2\\), which doesn't happen here. Wait, but in this case, the problem is different because the first expansion is \\((a + b)^4\\), which has \\(a^2b^2\\), and the second is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, when you multiply them, each term from the first is multiplied by each term from the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, which are \\(c^6, 6c^4, 15c^2, 20, 15c^{-2}, 6c^{-4}, c^{-6}\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient from the first part times the sum of the coefficients from the second part. The coefficients from the second part are 1, 6, 15, 20, 15, 6, 1. Adding those up: 1 + 6 = 7, 7 + 15 = 22, 22 + 20 = 42, 42 + 15 = 57, 57 + 6 = 63, 63 + 1 = 64. So, the sum is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 * 64 = 384. So, that's the answer. I think that's correct.\n\nWait, but let me check again. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, if I consider the entire expansion, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term from the second expansion, but since the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that's part of the product, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients from the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, if the problem was asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some \\(k\\), that would be different, but as it stands, it's just \\(a^2b^2\\), so I think 384 is the correct answer.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. The problem is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, when you expand this, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part, which are \\(c^6\\), \\(6c^4\\), \\(15c^2\\), \\(20\\), \\(15c^{-2}\\), \\(6c^{-4}\\), \\(c^{-6}\\). So, each of these terms has a coefficient, which are 1, 6, 15, 20, 15, 6, 1. So, when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each of these terms, you get \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(6a^2b^2c^4\\), etc. So, in the entire expansion, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the sum of all the coefficients from the second part, because each of those terms has \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by a coefficient. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by the sum of coefficients from the second part, which is 64. So, 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me confirm this with another approach. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, as we calculated. Now, when you multiply by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which can be written as \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, each term in this expansion is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each of these terms, you get \\(6 \\times \\dbinom{6}{k} a^2b^2 c^{6 - 2k}\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the sum over all \\(k\\) of \\(6 \\times \\dbinom{6}{k}\\). But the sum of \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}\\) for \\(k = 0\\) to \\(6\\) is \\(2^6 = 64\\). So, the total coefficient is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). Therefore, the answer is 384.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion is 6, and when multiplied by each term in the second expansion, which has coefficients summing to 64, the total coefficient is 6*64=384. That seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, if I consider the entire product, each term is of the form \\(a^kb^{4 - k} \\times c^m\\) or \\(a^kb^{4 - k} \\times c^{-m}\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\(k=2\\), and it's multiplied by each term from the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the sum of the coefficients from the second expansion, which is 6*64=384.\n\nWait, but perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think of it as two separate expansions. The first expansion gives me a polynomial in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the second gives me a polynomial in \\(c\\). When I multiply them, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is just the coefficient from the first part, because the second part doesn't affect \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). But that can't be right because when you multiply, each term from the first is multiplied by each term from the second, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the coefficient from the first part times the entire second expansion. But since the second expansion has multiple terms, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients from the second expansion, which is 6*64=384. So, I think that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, meaning that we're considering the product as a polynomial in \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\), and we're looking for the coefficient of the term \\(a^2b^2\\), which would be the same as the coefficient from the first part because the second part doesn't affect \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). Wait, but that doesn't make sense because the second part is being multiplied by the first part, so each term from the first part is multiplied by each term from the second part. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient from the first part times the sum of the coefficients from the second part. So, 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, to confirm, let me take a smaller example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^1 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, expanding, it's \\((a + b)(c + 1/c)\\). The coefficient of \\(a\\) would be 1 times the sum of coefficients in the second part, which is 1 + 1 = 2. So, the coefficient of \\(a\\) in the product would be 2, and similarly for \\(b\\). So, in this case, the coefficient of \\(a\\) is 2, which is 1 (from first part) times 2 (sum of coefficients in second part). Similarly, in our problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times 64, which is 384.\n\nSo, after going through this step by step, I think the coefficient is 384.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem**:\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\), so its coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n\n2. **Consider the second part \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)**:\n   This expansion has terms with various powers of \\(c\\), but when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), each term contributes a coefficient. The sum of all coefficients in this expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\(2^6 = 64\\).\n\n3. **Combine the results**:\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the product of the coefficients from both expansions:\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 64 = 384\n   \\]\n\n**Final Answer**: The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{384}\\)."

    "text": " But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I think the terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) might not affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, no, that doesn't make sense. Because when you multiply two polynomials, each term from the first polynomial is multiplied by each term from the second. But in this case, the first polynomial is in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the second is in \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, the variables are different. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, actually, no. Because when you multiply two polynomials, each term from the first is multiplied by each term from the second, but since the variables are different, the coefficients for \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't make sense because the coefficient should be a number, not a polynomial. Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. Let me think again. The problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term in the product of two expressions. But since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem just asks for the coefficient, so maybe it's considering the coefficient as a number, treating \\(c\\) as a variable separate from \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, maybe the coefficient is 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that seems odd because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, not a polynomial. Alternatively, perhaps I've misread the problem. Let me check again. The problem says: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, perhaps it's just the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that would make the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) a sum involving \\(c\\) terms, which doesn't seem right. Alternatively, maybe the problem is only considering the coefficient in terms of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the rest is separate. So, perhaps the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient isn't a single number, which is confusing because the problem asks for the coefficient. Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think differently. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product. Since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are in the first part and \\(c\\) is in the second part, the variables are separate, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part, which is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is 6 times that expansion, which is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem just asks for the coefficient, so maybe it's 6 times the entire expansion. But that seems unlikely because the problem probably expects a numerical value. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, so it's just 6. But that seems too simple. Wait, maybe I need to consider that the entire expression is a product, so when you expand it, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by each term from the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which would make the coefficient a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem is phrased as asking for the coefficient, so maybe it's expecting just the numerical coefficient, which would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't make sense because the coefficients in the second expansion are not all the same. Alternatively, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question. Maybe the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where \\(c\\) cancels out. That is, the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. So, in that case, I would need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part, then multiply them together. That might make sense. Let me check that. So, first, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, as I found earlier. Now, the second part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in this expansion because when you multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), you want the term where \\(c\\) cancels out, i.e., \\(c^0\\). So, let's expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem. The expansion is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k\\). Simplifying each term, that becomes \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} c^{-k} = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, we're looking for the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0. That is, \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire product is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120. Wait, but the problem didn't specify anything about \\(c\\), just \\(a^2b^2\\). So, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. But that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of the second part, which would make it a polynomial. But the problem is asking for a coefficient, which is a number, so perhaps I'm supposed to consider only the constant term with respect to \\(c\\), i.e., the term where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out, giving \\(c^0\\). That seems to make sense because otherwise, the coefficient would be a polynomial, which doesn't fit the question's phrasing. So, I think the correct approach is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and then multiply it by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part, which is 20, giving 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is found by first determining the coefficient in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplying it by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20. Therefore, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\boxed{120}"

But that would mean the coefficient is 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is not a number. Hmm, that doesn't make sense. Maybe the problem is actually to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, which would include all terms from the product, but only considering the \\(a^2b^2\\) part, and summing over all possible terms from the second expansion. Wait, but that would still involve \\(c\\). I'm getting confused here. Let me try to think differently. Maybe the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But the sum of coefficients in a polynomial is found by setting all variables to 1. So, if I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) becomes \\((1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times 64, which is 384. Wait, that seems plausible. Let me check that again. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) has a sum of coefficients equal to 64 when \\(c = 1\\). So, when we multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 multiplied by 64, which is 384. So, the answer should be 384. But wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake. Alternatively, maybe I should consider that when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in one polynomial is multiplied by the entire other polynomial. So, in this case, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) has a coefficient of 6 in \\((a + b)^4\\), and when multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), it becomes \\(6 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 \\times a^2b^2\\).

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that's not specified. Wait, maybe I misread the problem. Let me check again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, it's the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which would include all terms from the product.

But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, not a number. That can't be right because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. I must have made a mistake in my approach. Let me try another way. Maybe I need to consider that the entire product is a product of two independent expressions, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). As I calculated before, the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 64 when \\(c = 1\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), meaning the constant term. Because otherwise, the coefficient would depend on the power of \\(c\\), which complicates things. Let me check that. If the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then that would make sense. So, I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\) in the product. That would require me to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), then multiply them together. Let's try that approach. First, as before, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Now, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let's expand that using the binomial theorem. \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(k = 3\\). So, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Now, since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product, it would be the product of the coefficients from each part, which is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Wait, but earlier I thought it was 384, but that was without considering the specific term in the \\(c\\) expansion. So, which one is correct? Let me think again. The problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\". It doesn't specify anything about \\(c\\), so perhaps it's just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. That would mean that each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would make the coefficient a polynomial, which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times the constant term in the \\(c\\) expansion. So, in that case, it would be 6 * 20 = 120. Alternatively, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that would be a polynomial, not a number. I'm getting confused here. Let me check the problem statement again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" It doesn't specify anything about \\(c\\), so perhaps it's just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. But in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial. That doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. So, maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\). That would make sense because then we're looking for a specific term. So, let's proceed under that assumption. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) would be the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). As calculated before, that's 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the answer is 120. Wait, but earlier I thought it was 384, but that was when I considered the sum of all coefficients in the \\(c\\) expansion, which would be 64. But that approach was wrong because it included all powers of \\(c\\), not just the constant term. So, the correct approach is to consider only the constant term in the \\(c\\) expansion, which is 20, and multiply it by 6 to get 120. Let me double-check that. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) has terms from \\(c^6\\) down to \\(c^{-6}\\), with each term's exponent decreasing by 2 each time. The constant term is when the exponent is 0, which occurs at \\(k = 3\\), as I found earlier. So, the coefficient is indeed 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is 6 * 20 = 120. So, the answer should be 120. But wait, let me make sure. Alternatively, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without considering \\(c\\), which would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that would make the coefficient a polynomial, which doesn't make sense. Therefore, the problem must be asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. So, I think that's the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Next, we find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which occurs when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. This happens when \\(k = 3\\) in the binomial expansion, giving a coefficient of \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying these coefficients together, we get \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\boxed{120}."

    "text": " But wait, since the problem is asking only for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) are separate variables, their exponents won't affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, maybe I don't need to expand the entire expression. Instead, I can just consider the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, and then realize that when multiplying by the second part, the entire term would be 6 times whatever the term is from the second part. But wait, no, actually, the second part is being multiplied, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) would have to multiply in such a way that their exponents cancel out, leaving \\(c^0\\), which is 1. So, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me apply the binomial theorem again to this part. \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying each term, that becomes \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m} = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We need the term where the exponent is 0, so we set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part is 20. Now, going back to the original expression, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the second part), so 6 * 20 = 120. Wait, but is that correct? Let me double-check. Because when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second, so the coefficients multiply as well. So, yes, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) would indeed be 6 * 20 = 120. Alternatively, if I think about the entire expression as \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), then any term in the expansion would be of the form \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}a^{4 - k}b^k \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, for \\(a^2b^2\\), \\(k = 2\\), giving \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Then, for the \\(c\\) terms, we need \\(c^0\\), so \\(m = 3\\), giving \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying these together, 6 * 20 = 120. That seems right.

So, I think that the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the \\((a + b)^4\\) part, and the other part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), would contribute to other terms in the product. Wait, but actually, when you multiply two expressions together, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression. So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I need to consider all the terms in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) because when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), they will form terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2 \\cdot c^{-k}\\), but the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) itself would be the sum of all the coefficients from the second expression because \\(a^2b^2\\) times each term in the second expression will contribute to the overall coefficient. Wait, no, that might not be correct. Let me think again. Wait, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product. So, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the terms involving \\(a^2b^2\\) will be \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. Wait, no, because when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficients multiply. But in this case, the second part is in terms of \\(c\\), so when you multiply, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, but the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) itself would be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in the second expansion. Wait, but that doesn't make sense because the second expansion has terms with different powers of \\(c\\). Wait, actually, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in the product, each term from \\((a + b)^4\\) gets multiplied by each term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term from the second part, each of which has a coefficient. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 (the coefficient from the first part) multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients in the second part. Wait, but the second part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The sum of the coefficients in a polynomial is found by setting the variable to 1. So, if I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = (2)^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of the coefficients in the second part is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 * 64 = 384. Wait, but let me check that. Alternatively, maybe I should consider that when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, so the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. Hmm, that seems correct, but let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. Alternatively, perhaps I should think of the entire product as a product of two polynomials, and when looking for the coefficient of a specific term, I can consider the contributions from each part. So, in this case, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\) with coefficient 6, and then it's multiplied by every term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each of which has a coefficient. Therefore, the total coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would indeed be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. Let me confirm that by expanding the second part a bit. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) can be written as \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, each term has a coefficient of \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\) and a power of \\(c\\) of \\(6 - 2m\\). Now, when I multiply this by \\(a^2b^2\\), which has a coefficient of 6 from the first part, each term in the product will be \\(6 \\dbinom{6}{m} a^2b^2 c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 times the sum of all coefficients \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\) for \\(m\\) from 0 to 6. But the sum of \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\) from \\(m=0\\) to \\(6\\) is \\(2^6 = 64\\), as I thought earlier. Therefore, the coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384. Wait, but let me check: when I set \\(c = 1\\), I get the sum of the coefficients as 64, which is correct because \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). So, that part is correct. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 384. Wait, but let me make sure that I'm not missing anything. Another way to think about it is that since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are in one part, and \\(c\\) is in the other, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is only affected by the coefficients from the \\((a + b)^4\\) part, and the rest of the terms are just multiplied by the other expression. So, when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a term in the product is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each polynomial. But in this case, since \\(a^2b^2\\) is only from the first polynomial, and it's multiplied by every term in the second polynomial, the coefficient becomes 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 64. So, 6 * 64 = 384. That seems correct. Wait, but let me consider an example with smaller exponents to see if this approach is correct. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^1 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^1\\). Then, \\((a + b)(c + 1/c)\\). The coefficient of \\(a^1b^0\\) would be 1 times the sum of coefficients in the second part, which is \\(1 + 1 = 2\\), so 1 * 2 = 2. Indeed, expanding it, we get \\(ac + a/c + bc + b/c\\). The coefficient of \\(a\\) is 2, which is correct. Similarly, the coefficient of \\(b\\) is also 2. So, this approach works. Therefore, in our original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 * 64 = 384. So, I think that's the answer.\n\nWait, but let me make sure. Alternatively, maybe I should consider that the entire expression is the product of two independent expansions, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the product of the coefficients from each part. But in this case, the first part contributes 6, and the second part, when considering the product, contributes all its terms, but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), it's 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which is 64. So, 6 * 64 = 384. That makes sense.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can think of the entire expression as a product of two polynomials, and when looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), it's equivalent to finding the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and then multiplying it by the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Because the second part doesn't affect the powers of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), only the powers of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is indeed 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me just make sure I'm not making a mistake here. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. Now, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) expands to terms like \\(c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15/c^2 + 6/c^4 + 1/c^6\\). The sum of the coefficients here is 64, as calculated before. So, when I multiply 6 by each of these terms, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be 6 * (sum of coefficients in the second expansion) = 6 * 64 = 384. Therefore, the answer is 384. Yeah, that seems correct.\n\nWait, but another way to think about it is that when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a term like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) is the product of the coefficients of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial and \\(c^k\\) in the second polynomial. But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), we need to sum over all possible \\(k\\), which would mean summing all the coefficients in the second polynomial. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 * 64 = 384. So, I think that's correct.\n\nWait, but to be thorough, let me check with specific terms. For example, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial is 6a^2b^2. Then, when multiplied by each term in the second polynomial, it becomes 6a^2b^2 * (each term in the second expansion). So, the coefficient for each term like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\) is 6 * 1 = 6, for \\(a^2b^2c^4\\) it's 6 * 6 = 36, for \\(a^2b^2c^2\\) it's 6 * 15 = 90, for \\(a^2b^2\\) it's 6 * 20 = 120, and so on for the negative powers. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). Wait, but that's not correct because \\(a^2b^2\\) alone would have a coefficient of 120, but if you consider all the terms with \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by any power of \\(c\\), then the coefficient would be the sum of all those individual coefficients, which is 6 + 36 + 90 + 120 + 90 + 36 + 6 = let's calculate that. 6 + 36 = 42, +90 = 132, +120 = 252, +90 = 342, +36 = 378, +6 = 384. So, the total coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) across all powers of \\(c\\) is indeed 384. Therefore, the answer is 384.\n\nWait, but another thought: maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) irrespective of the power of \\(c\\), which would mean that the coefficient is 384. Alternatively, if it was asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for a specific \\(k\\), then it would be different, but since it's just \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\), it's 384. So, I think that's the correct answer.\n\nSo, to summarize: The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{384}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem and properties of polynomial multiplication.\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\):\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\n   \\]\n   So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\n2. **Consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   The sum of the coefficients in this expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\):\n   \\[\n   \\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\n   \\]\n\n3. **Combine the results:**\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is the product of the coefficient from the first expansion and the sum of the coefficients from the second expansion:\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 64 = 384\n   \\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{384}\\)."

But since the question is only about the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I think I don't need to worry about the \\(c\\) terms because they don't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) exponents. So, perhaps the coefficient remains 6, and the other part just adds more factors, but since we're only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the other part is in \\(c\\), maybe the coefficient doesn't change. Wait, but that doesn't seem right because the entire expression is a product of two expansions. Wait, no, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think again. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when you expand this, each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part will be multiplied by every term in the second expansion.

But wait, that doesn't make sense because the second part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which when expanded, has terms like \\(c^6\\), \\(6c^4\\), \\(15c^2\\), \\(20\\), \\(15c^{-2}\\), \\(6c^{-4}\\), \\(c^{-6}\\), etc. So, when you multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each of these terms, but since the question is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would just be \\(a^2b^2\\) times the sum of all the coefficients from the second expansion. But wait, that's not correct because the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion is obtained by setting \\(c = 1\\), so \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). So, then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 (from the first part) times 64 (sum of coefficients in the second part), so 6 * 64 = 384. Wait, but that seems high. Let me check again. Alternatively, maybe I'm supposed to consider that the second expansion doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be 6 times the entire second expansion, but that would mean the coefficient is 6 times whatever the second expansion is, but that can't be right because the coefficient is a number, not an expression. So, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Wait, the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product of the two expansions. So, when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first part, and it gets multiplied by the entire second expansion, but since the question is only about the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), it's the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, each of those terms would contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times the respective coefficient from the second expansion. So, the total coefficient would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion. The sum of the coefficients in the second expansion is obtained by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1/1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the total coefficient would be 6 * 64 = 384. Wait, that seems correct, but let me make sure. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think: the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the product of the coefficients of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Because when you multiply, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by the sum of coefficients in the second part, which is 64, so 6*64=384. So, the coefficient is 384. Alternatively, maybe I should think of it as the entire product, and when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in one part is multiplied by the entire other polynomial, so the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of the second part, but that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, which doesn't make sense. So, I think my initial approach is correct: the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second part, which is 64, so 384. Wait, but let me check: if I have two expressions, P(a, b) and Q(c), then the product P(a, b) * Q(c) will have terms where each term in P is multiplied by each term in Q. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in P(a, b) times the sum of the coefficients in Q(c), because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in Q(c), each term contributes its coefficient to the product. So, yes, the coefficient would be 6 * 64 = 384. Wait, but let me compute the sum of coefficients in Q(c) again. Q(c) is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). The sum of coefficients is when c = 1, so \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, that's correct. Therefore, the coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384. Wait, but I'm a bit confused because sometimes when you have multiple variables, the coefficient might involve more steps. Let me try another approach. Let me consider the entire expression: \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). When you expand this, each term will be of the form \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}a^{4 - k}b^k \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - m}(1/c)^m\\). So, simplifying the c terms, that's \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}\\dbinom{6}{m} a^{4 - k}b^k c^{6 - 2m}\\). Now, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) occurs when \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). So, for \\(a^2b^2\\), k = 2, and the coefficient from the first part is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Now, for the c terms, we have \\(c^{6 - 2m}\\). But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is independent of c, I think we need to sum over all possible m, because each term in the second expansion is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the total coefficient would be 6 times the sum of \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\) for m from 0 to 6. Because for each m, the term is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), so the coefficient accumulates as 6 times the sum of \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\). But the sum of \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\) from m=0 to 6 is \\(2^6 = 64\\). So, the coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384. That seems consistent with my earlier conclusion. So, I think the coefficient is 384. Alternatively, maybe I should think of it as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the entire expansion of the second part, but since we're only interested in the coefficient, it's 6 multiplied by the sum of coefficients in the second part, which is 64, so 6*64=384. Yeah, that makes sense. I think that's the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break down the problem as follows:\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\), so its coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n\n2. **Consider the second factor \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   When expanded, each term in this factor will be multiplied by the corresponding term from \\((a + b)^4\\). However, since we are only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), we need to account for all possible terms in the second expansion that, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), do not change the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). This means we need to sum the coefficients of all terms in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\n3. **Sum the coefficients of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   The sum of the coefficients is found by setting \\(c = 1\\):\n   \\[\n   \\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\n   \\]\n\n4. **Multiply the coefficients:**\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficient from the first expansion and the sum of the coefficients from the second expansion:\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 64 = 384\n   \\]\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{384}\\)."

    "text": " But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I think I can ignore the \\(c\\) terms because they won't affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, maybe I can just consider that the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by something that doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), so when I take the product, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will just be multiplied by the constant term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Wait, maybe I should consider the entire expansion, but since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are different variables, their exponents don't interfere with each other. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by every term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that doesn't make sense because then the coefficient would be a sum. Wait, no, actually, when you multiply two expressions, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial in \\(c\\), not a constant. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which I think refers to the coefficient in the entire product, treating \\(c\\) as another variable. Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, perhaps the question is asking for the coefficient of the term where \\(a\\) is squared and \\(b\\) is squared, regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, in other words, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) can be multiplied by any power of \\(c\\), but the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because when you multiply, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that can't be right because the sum of coefficients in a polynomial is found by setting all variables to 1. So, if I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 * 64 = 384. But wait, is that correct? Let me think again. When you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each polynomial. So, in this case, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) has a coefficient of 6, and when you multiply it by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in that expansion will multiply the 6, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is indeed 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, another way to think about it is that when you expand the entire product, each term in the product will be of the form \\((a^k b^{4 - k}) \\times (c^m (1/c)^{6 - m})\\), which simplifies to \\(a^k b^{4 - k} c^{m - (6 - m)} = a^k b^{4 - k} c^{2m - 6}\\). But since we're only interested in terms where \\(a^2b^2\\), that corresponds to \\(k = 2\\) and \\(4 - k = 2\\). So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) (which is 6) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 64. Therefore, 6 * 64 = 384. So, I think that's the answer. But wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in calculating the sum of coefficients. The sum of coefficients in a polynomial \\(P(c)\\) is indeed \\(P(1)\\). So, for \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), substituting \\(c = 1\\) gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, that part is correct. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, maybe I can approach this differently. Let me consider that the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6a\u00b2b\u00b2. Then, when I multiply this by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) will multiply 6a\u00b2b\u00b2, so the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384. So, I think that's correct. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting a different approach, but I can't think of another way right now. So, I'll go with 384 as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\).\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\), so its coefficient is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\n   \\]\n\n2. **Consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   This expansion will have terms involving various powers of \\(c\\).

Wait, but the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term without \\(c\\). That means I need to find the coefficient of the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero because \\(c^0 = 1\\). So, in other words, I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because when I multiply by that, it will contribute a constant factor to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Let me think about that. So, expanding \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem: \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying that, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m} = \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We want the exponent of \\(c\\) to be zero, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which gives \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Let me compute that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20. Now, since the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20, the overall coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Wait, but let me make sure I didn't miss anything. The original expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when we expand it, each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), we only consider the term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) that is a constant (i.e., \\(c^0\\)), which we found to be 20. Therefore, the coefficient is indeed 6 (from \\(a^2b^2\\)) multiplied by 20 (the constant term), giving 120. So, I think that's the answer. Let me just recap to ensure I didn't make a mistake: 1. Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using binomial theorem. 2. Find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is 6. 3. Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using binomial theorem. 4. Find the constant term, which is 20. 5. Multiply 6 and 20 to get 120. Yeah, that seems right. I don't see any errors in the steps.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20.
