    "text": " But the problem is only asking about the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, so does that mean I don't have to worry about the \\(c\\) terms? Because \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I think that term is only affected by the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from \\((a + b)^4\\), and then it gets multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, the question is just about the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so maybe I don't need to consider the \\(c\\) terms at all? Hmm, no, that doesn't make sense. Because when you multiply two polynomials, the exponents of different variables don't affect each other. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, that's not possible because the product would have terms with \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) and \\(a^2b^2(1/c)^k\\) for various \\(k\\). So, perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). Or maybe it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times some power of \\(c\\). Wait, the problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", but in the entire expression, which includes \\(c\\) terms. So, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Wait, no, maybe the question is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, if I think of it as a polynomial in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) with coefficients that are polynomials in \\(c\\), then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the term from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient would be 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that seems odd because the coefficient is itself a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient, so maybe I'm misunderstanding. Wait, maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, meaning considering all possible terms, but perhaps it's expecting a numerical coefficient, but that doesn't make sense because \\(c\\) is a variable. Hmm, perhaps I misread the problem. Let me check again. The problem is: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, the expression is a product of two binomials, each raised to a power. So, when you multiply them out, you get terms like \\(a^k b^{4 - k} c^m\\) or \\(a^k b^{4 - k} c^{-m}\\) for various exponents \\(k\\) and \\(m\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the sum of all the terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by some power of \\(c\\), either positive or negative. But wait, that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which seems a bit strange. Alternatively, maybe the problem is only considering the coefficient in terms of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable, so the coefficient would be the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) multiplied by 6. But that seems too involved. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is miswritten, and it's supposed to be \\((a + b + c + 1/c)^4\\) or something else, but as it is, I have to work with \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Wait, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, meaning that the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't seem right because coefficients are usually numerical. Alternatively, maybe the problem is only considering the coefficient when multiplied by some specific term in the \\(c\\) expansion, but that's not indicated. Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think again. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, when you expand this, each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, that would be 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that's a polynomial in \\(c\\), so the coefficient is itself a polynomial, not a number. But the problem is asking for \"the coefficient\", so maybe I'm misunderstanding. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. That would make sense because then the coefficient would be a number. So, maybe I should find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the expansion. Let me assume that's the case. So, I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). That would mean that I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), and then multiply them together. So, first, as before, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. Next, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Let me compute that. Using the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\times (1/c)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, we need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be 0, which occurs when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Now, since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), we multiply the two coefficients together: 6 (from \\(a^2b^2\\)) times 20 (from \\(c^0\\)), which gives 120. So, the coefficient is 120. Wait, let me double-check that. So, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. In \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Multiplying them gives 6 * 20 = 120. So, yes, that seems correct. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is 120. But the problem just says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", so maybe it's expecting 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but that doesn't make sense because coefficients are numbers. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only considering the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, meaning that it's 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but that's a polynomial, not a number. So, maybe the problem intended to ask for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be 120. Alternatively, perhaps I misread the problem, and it's actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be 120. Let me see if there's another way. Alternatively, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable, so the coefficient would be 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that seems unlikely because coefficients are usually numerical. So, I think the intended answer is 120, assuming that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). Alternatively, perhaps the problem is written incorrectly, and it's supposed to be a single expression with all four variables, but as it is, I think the answer is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then finding the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20. Multiplying these gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\boxed{120}"

So, does that mean I can ignore the terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) because they won't affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)? Hmm, maybe, but I need to check. Wait, no, because when you multiply the two expressions together, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which comes from \\((a + b)^4\\), the terms from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) would just contribute a factor that's multiplied by the coefficient we found. So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, I might need to consider all the terms from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) and multiply them by the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\). But wait, that might not be necessary because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, perhaps the terms involving \\(c\\) don't affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) because \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) are separate variables. Let me think. When you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by every term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, no, that doesn't sound right. Because each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) has a coefficient and a power of \\(c\\), but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a separate variable, the coefficients from the \\(c\\) terms will just add up when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but actually, no. Because when you multiply two polynomials, each term from the first polynomial is multiplied by each term from the second. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all terms in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that's not quite right either. Wait, no, because each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is a term with some power of \\(c\\), but since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), the coefficient would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Because for each term in the second part, when you multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), you get a term like \\(a^2b^2 \\times c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2 \\times c^{-k}\\), etc., each contributing to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) with different powers of \\(c\\). But the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, actually, the coefficient would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Because each term in the second part, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), adds its coefficient to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. So, the coefficient we're looking for is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Now, how do I find the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)? Well, the sum of coefficients in a polynomial is found by setting all variables to 1. So, if I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = (2)^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). Wait, but let me double-check that because I might have made a mistake. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and the rest of the terms involve \\(c\\), perhaps the coefficients involving \\(c\\) don't affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and the coefficient remains 6. But that doesn't seem right because when you multiply by the entire second expression, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would indeed be 6 times the sum of coefficients in the second expression. But wait, let me think again. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first part, and when multiplied by any term from the second part, it becomes \\(a^2b^2 \\times \\text{something}\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which is 64, giving 384. But I'm not entirely sure if that's correct because I might be confusing the way coefficients combine. Alternatively, maybe I should consider that the second part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), when expanded, has terms with different powers of \\(c\\), but when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), each term becomes \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2c^{-k}\\), etc. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would actually be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which is 64, so 6*64=384. Therefore, the coefficient is 384. Wait, but let me check with a smaller exponent to see if my reasoning holds. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^1 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, the coefficient of \\(a^1b^0\\) would be 1, and the sum of coefficients in the second part is 2, so the coefficient of \\(a^1b^0\\) in the product would be 1*2=2. But let's compute it directly: \\((a + b)(c + 1/c) = ac + a/c + bc + b/c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^1b^0\\) is 2, which matches 1*2=2. Similarly, if I take \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{2}{0}=1\\), and the sum of coefficients in the second part is 2, so the coefficient would be 1*2=2. Indeed, expanding \\((a + b)^2(c + 1/c) = (a^2 + 2ab + b^2)(c + 1/c)\\), and the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) is 1*2=2. So, my reasoning seems correct. Therefore, in the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6*64=384. So, I think that's the answer.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is found using the binomial coefficient \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). The sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), giving \\(2^6 = 64\\). Multiplying these gives \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\boxed{384}."

But that seems odd because the coefficient would then be a polynomial in \\(c\\). Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times some term in \\(c\\), but the way it's phrased, it's just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so maybe the \\(c\\) terms are irrelevant here. Wait, that can't be right because the entire expression is the product of both, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of all terms in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).

When you multiply these two expressions together, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) has a coefficient of 6, and when multiplied by each term in the other expansion, it becomes 6 times each term. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would then be 6 times the sum of all the terms in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that's not right because the sum of all terms in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) would be a specific value, but actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems like the coefficient would be a polynomial, not a single number. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, meaning that the coefficient is just 6, and the \\(c\\) terms are separate. But that doesn't seem right because when you multiply, the coefficients would involve the \\(c\\) terms. Wait, perhaps I'm misinterpreting the problem. Let me check: The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so it's only concerned with the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and not with \\(c\\). So, in that case, when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the same as in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).

But the problem just asks for the coefficient, not necessarily a numerical value, so maybe that's acceptable. Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it, and the problem is only concerned with the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms, and the \\(c\\) terms are just part of the expression, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just 6 times whatever the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is. But that seems odd because the problem is likely expecting a numerical coefficient. Hmm, maybe I need to clarify. Let me try to think differently. Perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, considering all variables, but that doesn't make sense because \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\). Wait, perhaps the problem is actually written as \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), and the question is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), treating \\(c\\) as another variable. So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, which is not a single number. So, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Alternatively, maybe the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where \\(c\\) cancels out, so that the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. In that case, I would need to find the term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, and then multiply that by 6. Let me check that possibility. So, if that's the case, then first, I find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiply it by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Then, the total coefficient would be 6 times that coefficient. Let me try that approach. So, first, as before, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. Now, for \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), I can use the binomial theorem again. The expansion is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k\\). Simplifying that, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} c^{-k} = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, the exponent of \\(c\\) in each term is \\(6 - 2k\\). We want the term where the exponent is 0, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire product would be 6 times 20, which is 120. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, considering that \\(c\\) terms must cancel out, is 120. Alternatively, if the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without considering \\(c\\), then it would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial, but that seems unlikely. Therefore, I think the intended interpretation is that the problem wants the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by the term where \\(c\\) cancels out, i.e., \\(c^0\\), which gives us 120. So, putting it all together, the coefficient is 6 times 20, which is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplying it by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20.

Since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and the other part of the expression is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is multiplied by \\((a + b)^4\\), but since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), the terms involving \\(c\\) won't affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, no, that can't be right because when you multiply two expressions, each term in one expression is multiplied by each term in the other. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and the other part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be 6 times whatever the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is. Wait, no, that's not correct either. Because when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which comes from the term in \\((a + b)^4\\), and the term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) would just be a constant multiplier for that term. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but actually, the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is obtained by setting \\(c = 1\\). So, \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 * 64 = 384. Wait, but I'm not sure if that's the right approach. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, meaning that the \\(c\\) terms are just part of the expression but don't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. So, maybe the coefficient is just 6, and the rest is extra. Hmm, that seems conflicting. Let me think again. The problem is: What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when you expand this product, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by every term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which means that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that can't be right because then the coefficient would be a sum of multiple terms, not a single coefficient. Wait, no, actually, when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in one polynomial gets multiplied by all the terms in the other polynomial. But in this case, since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), the only way that term can appear is if it's multiplied by the term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) that has \\(c^0\\), i.e., the constant term. Because if you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by a term with \\(c^k\\), you'll get \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), which isn't just \\(a^2b^2\\). So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, that makes sense. So, first, let's find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which we've already found to be 6. Then, we need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let's work on that. Using the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, we need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0. So, set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 * 20 = 120. Wait, that seems more reasonable. So, putting it all together: The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Multiplying these together gives 6 * 20 = 120. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120. Let me just double-check to make sure I didn't make a mistake. So, \\((a + b)^4\\) has \\(a^2b^2\\) with coefficient 6. \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) has a constant term with coefficient 20. So, when multiplied, 6 * 20 = 120. Yeah, that seems correct. I think that's the right answer.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break down the problem as follows:\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\), so its coefficient is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\n   \\]\n\n2. **Find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n   \\]\n   The constant term occurs when \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\). The coefficient is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\n   \\]\n\n3. **Multiply the coefficients:**\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the two coefficients:\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 20 = 120\n   \\]\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

But wait, that doesn't seem right because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would be a term without any \\(c\\) involved. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding. Wait, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. That is, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by some combination of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). But the problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", which usually refers to the coefficient in front of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of other variables. So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems too broad because the coefficient would then be a polynomial in \\(c\\), not a single number. Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me read the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, perhaps it's just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. That is, when you expand the entire expression, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by some combination of terms from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), and the coefficient would be the sum of all those products. But wait, that might not make sense because the problem is asking for a single coefficient. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times any power of \\(c\\), so it's just the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial. But the problem is asking for a coefficient, which is a number, so perhaps I'm misunderstanding. Alternatively, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), is just a separate factor, so the overall coefficient would be 6 multiplied by whatever the expansion of the second part is. But that doesn't make sense because the coefficient should be a number. Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Maybe the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which would be 6 times the sum of all terms in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that would still be a polynomial. Hmm, I'm confused. Wait, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), that is, the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2 and 2 respectively, and the exponents of \\(c\\) sum to zero, so that the term is just \\(a^2b^2\\) times some constant. That might make sense. So, in that case, I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product. So, let's approach it that way. So, the product is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when we expand this, each term will be of the form \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}a^{2}b^{2} \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{n}\\), where \\(n\\) is the exponent from the second expansion. But since we're looking for the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, that is, \\(c^0\\), we need to find the term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) where the exponent is zero. So, first, let me find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, we need the exponent \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which implies \\(m = 3\\). So, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, the term with \\(c^0\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product is the product of the coefficients from each expansion, which is 6 (from \\(a^2b^2\\)) times 20 (from \\(c^0\\)), so 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient is 120. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake. So, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6, as we calculated. Then, in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20, so when you multiply these two, you get 6 * 20 = 120. So, yes, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe I should think of it as the product of the two expansions, so each term is a product of a term from \\((a + b)^4\\) and a term from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\), and the term \\(c^0\\) comes from the other expansion, so their product is \\(a^2b^2 \\times c^0\\), which is just \\(a^2b^2\\), and the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120. Yeah, that makes sense. So, I think the coefficient is 120.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break down the problem into two parts.\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\), so the coefficient is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\n   \\]\n\n2. **Find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n   \\]\n   The exponent \\(6 - 2m = 0\\) when \\(m = 3\\), so the coefficient is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\n   \\]\n\n3. **Multiply the coefficients from both parts:**\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 20 = 120\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is 120.\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{120}\n\\]"

But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would include all the coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by 6 (the coefficient from the first part). Wait, but that would make the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) equal to 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which doesn't make sense because the problem is probably expecting a numerical coefficient. Hmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" Wait, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, in other words, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, but the problem is only focusing on \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). But that seems odd because \\(c\\) is part of the expression. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, considering all possible \\(c\\) terms. But that would mean the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\), which is probably not the case. Wait, maybe I should consider that the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where the exponents of \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are 2, 2, and 0 respectively. That would make sense because otherwise, the coefficient would include terms with \\(c\\). So, let's assume that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). If that's the case, then I need to find the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\). So, first, from \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, as I found earlier. Then, from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), I need the coefficient of \\(c^0\\), which is the constant term. So, let me find that. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) can be done using the binomial theorem as well. So, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Now, since we're looking for the term \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), the overall coefficient would be the product of the coefficients from each part, which is 6 (from \\((a + b)^4\\)) multiplied by 20 (from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)). So, 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is 120. But wait, the problem didn't specify the \\(c^0\\) part, it just said \\(a^2b^2\\). So, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the entire product, and \\(a^2b^2\\) can be multiplied by any power of \\(c\\), but the coefficient would then be a term involving \\(c\\). But that seems unlikely because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. So, maybe the problem is indeed asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), which would mean that it's 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would make the coefficient a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't seem right. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable, but that would mean that the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which is more complex. Wait, maybe I should think differently. Let me consider that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, without considering the \\(c\\) terms. So, that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that would be a very long expression. But that doesn't make sense because the problem is likely expecting a numerical answer. Therefore, I think the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120, as I calculated earlier. So, to recap, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Multiplying them together gives 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is 120. So, I think that's the answer.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake. First, expanding \\((a + b)^4\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed when \\(k=2\\), so \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Then, expanding \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term with \\(c^0\\) is when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), so \\(m=3\\), and \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, multiplying 6 and 20 gives 120. That seems correct. I think I'm confident with that answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem for both parts of the expression.\n\n1. **Expanding \\((a + b)^4\\)**:\n   Using the binomial theorem, the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is:\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\).

So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by every term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. Wait, but that's not possible because \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term without \\(c\\), so when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by terms involving \\(c\\), you'll get terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) where \\(k\\) is some exponent. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would only include the term where the \\(c\\) exponents cancel out, i.e., where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. So, in other words, I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is equal to the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) multiplied by the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which we found to be 6. So, first, let's find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Again, we can use the binomial theorem for this. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying each term, that becomes \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m} = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be zero, so we set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Now, going back to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the other part is 20. Since these two parts are multiplied together, the overall coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Wait, let me double-check that. So, when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term comes from the first expansion, and it gets multiplied by all terms in the second expansion. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is independent of \\(c\\), we need to find how many times \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), i.e., the constant term with respect to \\(c\\), which is the \\(c^0\\) term. So, yes, the coefficient would be 6 (from \\(a^2b^2\\)) multiplied by 20 (from the constant term in \\(c\\)), giving 120. That seems correct. Alternatively, I can think of it as the product of the coefficients from each expansion where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2 each, and the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out. So, yeah, I think 120 is the right answer.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is found by considering the product of the binomial coefficients from each part of the expression. \n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\)**:\n   - The term \\(a^2b^2\\) has a coefficient of \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n\n2. **Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)**:\n   - The constant term (where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0) occurs at \\(m = 3\\), giving a coefficient of \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n\n3. **Multiply the coefficients**:\n   - The overall coefficient is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

So, maybe when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be the same as the coefficient in \\((a + b)^4\\) because the other part doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\). Wait, but let me think again. Because when you multiply two expressions, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), maybe the terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) just contribute a factor that's multiplied by 1. Let me try to make sense of it.

Wait, that doesn't make sense because \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is a separate expression. Maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try a different approach. Since the two parts of the expression are multiplied together, the terms in each part are multiplied term by term. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all the terms in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, that's not correct because when you multiply two expressions, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second, and then you add them up. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), we need to consider how many ways we can get \\(a^2b^2\\) from the product. Wait, but in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms are separate from the \\(c\\) terms. So, when you multiply, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first part will be multiplied by every term in the second part. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), we need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and then multiply it by the sum of all the coefficients in the second part, because each term in the second part will just add a multiple to the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. Wait, that makes more sense. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But the sum of all coefficients in a polynomial is found by setting all variables to 1. So, if I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) becomes \\((1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of all coefficients in the second part is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 times 64, which is 384. Wait, but let me check that again. Because when you multiply two expressions, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expression multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second expression, because each term in the second expression adds a multiple to the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. So, yes, that would be 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, perhaps another way to think about it is that since the two expressions are independent, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is simply the product of the coefficients from each part, but since we're only considering the \\(a^2b^2\\) term, the second part's entire expansion contributes a factor of 64. So, 6 * 64 = 384. Hmm, that seems correct. Let me see if there's another way to approach it. Alternatively, perhaps I can consider the entire expansion and see if any terms from the second part affect the \\(a^2b^2\\) term, but since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), the exponents of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) don't affect the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). Therefore, when looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), it's just the coefficient in the first part multiplied by the entire second part's expansion, which is 64. So, 6 * 64 = 384.

But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term without \\(c\\), I think that means we need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), because \\(c^0 = 1\\), so that term would just be a constant. So, essentially, we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, which would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, that makes sense. Therefore, I need to compute two things: 1. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which I already found as 6. 2. The coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Then, multiply these two coefficients together to get the final coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression. So, now I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me think about how to expand this. Again, using the binomial theorem, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k\\). Simplifying that, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\times c^{-k} = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, we need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be 0. So, set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(6 = 2k\\) => \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Let me compute that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20.

So, 6 multiplied by 20 is 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression is 120. Wait, let me double-check to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

Wait, but that can't be right because the entire expression is a product of both parts. Let me think again. Actually, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term comes from the \\((a + b)^4\\) part, and when you multiply by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), that term must come from the product where the second part is multiplied by 1, i.e., the term where \\(c^0\\) is taken from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\).

Maybe the question is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, but considering only the terms where the exponents of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) cancel each other out, meaning \\(c^0\\). Because otherwise, the coefficient would depend on the power of \\(c\\), but since the problem doesn't specify any \\(c\\) term, maybe it's looking for the coefficient when the \\(c\\) terms are multiplied such that they result in a constant term, i.e., \\(c^0\\). So, perhaps I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) and then multiply it by the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part, which is 6. That makes sense because when you multiply the two expansions, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term would be multiplied by the constant term from the second expansion, resulting in a term that's purely \\(a^2b^2\\) times that constant. So, let's try that approach. First, I'll find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). To do this, I can use the binomial theorem again. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, I need to find the value of \\(m\\) such that the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0. So, set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(6 = 2m\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Now, going back to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is the product of the coefficients we found from each expansion. That is, 6 (from \\(a^2b^2\\)) multiplied by 20 (from \\(c^0\\)). So, 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120. Wait, let me double-check that. So, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6. In \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the constant term is when the exponent is 0, which occurs at \\(m=3\\), and the coefficient is 20. So, when we multiply these two expansions together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by the constant term 20 from the second part, giving \\(a^2b^2 * 20\\), so the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120. Yeah, that seems correct.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplying it by the constant term (coefficient of \\(c^0\\)) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20. Therefore, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\boxed{120}"

    "text": " But wait, the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, does that mean that the terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) don't affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)? Hmm, maybe not, because \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\). So, perhaps when we multiply the two expressions together, the terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) will just tag along, but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), we can ignore the \\(c\\) terms because they don't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) parts. Wait, but let me think again. When we multiply two polynomials, each term in the first polynomial gets multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. So, if I have \\((a + b)^4\\) times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), then each term from the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term from the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), that means we only need to consider the terms where the product results in \\(a^2b^2\\) times some power of \\(c\\). But actually, when we look for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), it's just the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because the \\(c\\) terms don't interfere with the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. Wait, no, that might not be accurate. Let me think again. When you multiply two expressions, the coefficients multiply. So, if I have a term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part with coefficient 6, and then I multiply it by the entire expansion of the second part, which is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients from the second expansion. But wait, that doesn't seem right because each term in the second expansion is a different power of \\(c\\), so when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each of those, you get terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), etc., each with their own coefficients. But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would actually be the sum of all the coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by the coefficient from the first part. But wait, no, that's not correct either because each term in the product would have both \\(a^2b^2\\) and some power of \\(c\\). So, if we're only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then we have to consider all the terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any power of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, the sum of all coefficients in a polynomial is found by plugging in 1 for all variables. So, if I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) becomes \\((1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion is 64. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 * 64 = 384. Wait, but that seems too straightforward. Let me check again. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), when we multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the coefficients of the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms don't depend on \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is simply the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, no, that's not correct because when you multiply two polynomials, each term is multiplied by each term, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually be the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all coefficients from the second part. Because each term in the second part is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), so the total coefficient is 6 times 64, which is 384. But let me think again: when you have two polynomials, say P(a, b) and Q(c), then the coefficient of a term like \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product P(a, b) * Q(c) is just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in P(a, b) multiplied by the entire polynomial Q(c). So, if we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then it's indeed 6 * 64 = 384. But wait, the problem is phrased as \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", which might imply that we're considering terms where the exponents of \\(c\\) are zero, i.e., the constant term. Wait, that's a possibility. So, maybe I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\). That would make more sense because otherwise, the coefficient would depend on the power of \\(c\\). So, perhaps I was wrong earlier. Let me clarify: the problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\". Since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are different variables, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would have an exponent of 0 for \\(c\\). So, I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product. That changes things. So, I need to find the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\). So, first, from \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, as before. Then, from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), I need the coefficient of \\(c^0\\), which is the constant term. So, I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me expand that using the binomial theorem. The expansion is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We want the exponent of \\(c\\) to be 0, so we set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\). So, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product is the product of the coefficients from each part, which is 6 * 20 = 120. So, the final answer should be 120.\n\nWait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake. So, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which I now think refers to \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), because otherwise, the coefficient would include all powers of \\(c\\), which doesn't make much sense in the context of a single term. So, by finding the constant term in the second expansion, I get 20, and then multiplying by 6 gives 120. That seems correct. Alternatively, if the problem had asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some specific \\(k\\), that would be different, but as it stands, I think 120 is the right answer.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to consider that when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each polynomial. So, in this case, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\), and the term \\(c^0\\) comes from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, just to double-check, let me calculate \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\) again. 6 choose 3 is indeed 20 because 6*5*4/(3*2*1) = 20. And 4 choose 2 is 6. So, 6*20 is 120. Yep, that's correct.\n\nSo, I think I've got it. The coefficient is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is found by considering the binomial expansions of each part and identifying the constant term in the second expansion.\n\nStep-by-Step Explanation:\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term with \\(a^2b^2\\) occurs when \\(k = 2\\):\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\n   \\]\n   So, the coefficient from the first part is 6.\n\n2. **Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k}\\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n   \\]\n   We need the constant term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0:\n   \\[\n   6 - 2k = 0 \\implies k = 3\n   \\]\n   The constant term is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\n   \\]\n   So, the coefficient from the second part is 20.\n\n3. **Multiply the coefficients from both parts:**\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 20 = 120\n   \\]\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which comes from \\((a + b)^4\\), the terms from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) will affect the overall coefficient, but we have to consider how.

But that can't be, because the product would have terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for various \\(k\\), and each of those would have their own coefficients. So, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by any power of \\(c\\), but that's not standard. Alternatively, maybe the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when considering the entire expression, which would include terms from all possible powers of \\(c\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\). Wait, no, that's not right. Let me re-read the problem: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, it's asking for the coefficient of the term \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). That is, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by some combination of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, in other words, in the expansion, any term that has \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^k\\) or \\(c^{-k}\\) would contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). But since the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, perhaps we need to consider that the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But that seems a bit odd. Alternatively, maybe the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when the entire expression is expanded, which would involve summing over all possible \\(c\\) terms. Wait, but that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\). Alternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, but that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But that seems complicated. Alternatively, maybe the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, considering that the entire product is a product of two polynomials, and the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by any term from the second polynomial, so the coefficient would be the sum over all possible terms from the second polynomial multiplied by the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial. Wait, that makes sense. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that can't be, because then it would be 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient, which is a number. Hmm, so perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Maybe it's to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating \\(c\\) as a variable, so the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem didn't specify, so maybe I need to re-examine the problem statement again. Wait, the problem is: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, perhaps it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the powers of \\(c\\), meaning that the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem might have been intended to ask for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), that is, the constant term with respect to \\(c\\). Alternatively, maybe the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by any power of \\(c\\), but that's unclear. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when considering the entire product, which would involve summing over all possible terms. Wait, no, the coefficient of a term in a product is the product of the coefficients, considering the variables separately. So, if I have two polynomials, say, P(a, b) and Q(c), then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product P(a, b) * Q(c) would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in P(a, b) multiplied by Q(c). So, in this case, since \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is a polynomial in \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems odd because the coefficient would then be a polynomial in \\(c\\), not a constant. Therefore, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). That is, if we're only interested in the term where the power of \\(c\\) is zero, then the coefficient would be 6 times the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Alternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable, so the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\). But since the problem didn't specify, I'm a bit confused. Let me try to think differently. Maybe the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when considering the entire expression, but the variables \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are independent, so the coefficient would be the product of the coefficients from each part. That is, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^k\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}\\), so the overall coefficient would be 6 times \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}\\) for each \\(k\\). But that doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a single coefficient. Therefore, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, regardless of the powers of \\(c\\), which would mean that the coefficient is a sum over all possible \\(k\\) of 6 times \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}\\). But that would make the coefficient a sum, which isn't a single number. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), that is, the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\). In that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, let's compute the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem, the expansion is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). The constant term occurs when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which implies \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire product would be 6 times 20, which is 120. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, considering only the constant term with respect to \\(c\\), is 120. Alternatively, if the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the powers of \\(c\\), then the coefficient would be 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But since the problem didn't specify, I think the intended answer is 120, considering only the constant term with respect to \\(c\\). Therefore, I think the coefficient is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplying it by the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).

So, maybe I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire product. That would make sense because then the answer would be a numerical coefficient without any \\(c\\) terms. So, let me try that approach. So, first, find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6 as I found earlier. Then, find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is the constant term. Once I have both coefficients, I can multiply them together to get the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product, which is what the problem is asking for. So, let's compute the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20. Now, going back to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is the product of the coefficients we found: 6 (from \\(a^2b^2\\)) multiplied by 20 (from \\(c^0\\)). So, 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is 120.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes here. So, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). I considered that in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the terms involving \\(c\\) don't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the same as in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all terms in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that doesn't make sense because when you multiply by the entire expansion, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, perhaps the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But that contradicts the problem's phrasing, which just asks for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), implying it's a numerical coefficient, not involving \\(c\\). So, maybe I was right the first time that the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, meaning it's 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that would mean the coefficient is a sum of terms involving different powers of \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the problem is likely expecting a single numerical coefficient. Therefore, I think the correct approach is to consider that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the constant term of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20, giving a total of 120. So, I think my answer is correct.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break down the problem into two parts using the binomial theorem.\n\n1. **Expanding \\((a + b)^4\\):**\n   Using the binomial theorem, we expand \\((a + b)^4\\) as:\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\):\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\n   \\]\n   So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\n2. **Expanding \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   Using the binomial theorem, we expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) as:\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n   \\]\n   We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0:\n   \\[\n   6 - 2k = 0 \\implies k = 3\n   \\]\n   The constant term is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\n   \\]\n\n3. **Combining the results:**\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is the product of the coefficients found:\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 20 = 120\n   \\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}."

    "text": " But since I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), maybe I don't need to consider the \\(c\\) terms because \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\). So, perhaps the \\(c\\) part doesn't affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Let me think about that. When you multiply two expressions together, each term in the first expression multiplies each term in the second expression. So, if I have a term \\(a^2b^2\\) from \\((a + b)^4\\) and any term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the resulting term would have both \\(a^2b^2\\) and some power of \\(c\\). But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which means it's considering the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2, regardless of what's happening with \\(c\\). Wait, but actually, no, that's not quite right. Because in the product, each term from \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), it would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part, because any term from the second part, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), would contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times some \\(c\\) term. Wait, but the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, maybe I can treat the two parts separately. Let me clarify: the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because when you multiply, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are different variables, the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is by taking the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from \\((a + b)^4\\) and multiplying it by any term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by, say, \\(c^k\\), you get \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), which is a different term. So, perhaps the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is just the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), because all the other terms would involve \\(c\\) as well. Wait, that doesn't seem right because when you multiply two polynomials, each term from the first polynomial is multiplied by each term from the second. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would actually be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Because when you take \\(a^2b^2\\) and multiply it by each term in the second polynomial, each of those will contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times some power of \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\). Wait, no, that's not possible because \\(c\\) is present in the expression. So, perhaps I need to consider that the term \\(a^2b^2\\) can be multiplied by any term from the second polynomial, which includes various powers of \\(c\\), but the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) itself would just be the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Because each term in the second part, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), contributes to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times a power of \\(c\\), but since the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, I think I need to sum all those contributions. Alternatively, maybe the problem is expecting the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, considering all possible terms, which would involve the product of the coefficients from each part. Wait, perhaps I should think of it as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part, because \\(c^0\\) is 1, so that term would just contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). But wait, that's only if I'm looking for the term where the exponents of \\(c\\) are zero. But the problem didn't specify anything about \\(c\\), so maybe it's considering all possible terms, and the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the same as the coefficient in the first part times the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Let me approach it differently. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me first compute the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem. The expansion would be \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k\\). Simplifying that, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} c^{-k} = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, the expansion is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). Now, when I multiply this by \\((a + b)^4\\), which we know has a term \\(a^2b^2\\) with coefficient 6, the product will have terms like \\(a^2b^2 \\times \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\) for each \\(k\\) from 0 to 6. So, each term in the product will be \\(6 \\times \\dbinom{6}{k} a^2b^2 c^{6 - 2k}\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would be the sum of all the coefficients from the \\(c\\) terms multiplied by 6. Wait, no, that's not quite right. Because each term in the product is \\(6 \\times \\dbinom{6}{k} a^2b^2 c^{6 - 2k}\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 times the sum of all \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}\\) for \\(k\\) from 0 to 6. But wait, that can't be right because the sum of \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}\\) from \\(k=0\\) to 6 is \\(2^6 = 64\\). So, would the coefficient be 6 \u00d7 64 = 384? But that seems high. Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but in the entire expansion, that term would be multiplied by various powers of \\(c\\). So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then it would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 6 \u00d7 64 = 384. But that doesn't seem right because each term in the second polynomial is a specific power of \\(c\\), and the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be 6 times each coefficient from the second polynomial, but that's not the case. Wait, no, when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second polynomial, each term contributes to a different term in the product. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^k\\) would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^k\\) in the second polynomial. But the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), without any restriction on \\(c\\). So, perhaps the answer is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 6 \u00d7 64 = 384. But let me check that. Alternatively, maybe the problem is only considering the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which would include all possible powers of \\(c\\), so the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial. But that would mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 \u00d7 64 = 384. Alternatively, perhaps I'm making a mistake here because when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in one variable is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each polynomial. Wait, but in this case, \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial. Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second polynomial, each term contributes to a different term in the product, but the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) itself (without considering \\(c\\)) would be the sum of all those contributions. Wait, no, that's not correct because each term in the product has both \\(a^2b^2\\) and some power of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^k\\) would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^k\\) in the second polynomial. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a bit ambiguous. It could mean the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), which would be the sum over all \\(k\\) of 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^k\\), which would be 6 \u00d7 (sum of coefficients in the second polynomial) = 6 \u00d7 64 = 384. Alternatively, it could mean the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second polynomial. Let me check what the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). From the expansion earlier, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, \\(6 - 2k = 0\\) implies \\(k = 3\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it's 6 \u00d7 20 = 120. But the problem didn't specify anything about \\(c\\), so I'm a bit confused. Let me reread the problem: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" It just says \\(a^2b^2\\), without any \\(c\\) terms. So, perhaps it's considering the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times any power of \\(c\\). But in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 6 \u00d7 64 = 384. Alternatively, if it's only considering the term where \\(c\\) is to the zero power, then it's 6 \u00d7 20 = 120. Hmm, I'm not sure which interpretation is correct. Let me think about how coefficients work in products of polynomials. When you have two polynomials multiplied together, the coefficient of a specific term (like \\(a^2b^2\\)) in the product is the sum over all coefficients from the second polynomial multiplied by the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial. Because each term in the second polynomial, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), contributes to a different term in the product, but the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) itself (without considering \\(c\\)) would be the sum of all those contributions. Wait, that can't be right because each term would have a different power of \\(c\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually be the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial. So, in that case, it would be 6 \u00d7 64 = 384. But I'm not entirely confident. Alternatively, maybe the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, without considering the \\(c\\) terms, which would mean that it's 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial. Let me verify that. Let's consider a simpler case: suppose I have \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). The expansion would be \\((a^2 + 2ab + b^2) \\times (c + 1/c)\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be zero because there's no \\(a^2b^2\\) term. Wait, no, that's not right because in this case, the first polynomial is degree 2, so \\(a^2b^0\\), \\(a^1b^1\\), and \\(a^0b^2\\). So, actually, there's no \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first polynomial. But if I have \\((a + b)^4\\), as in the original problem, then \\(a^2b^2\\) is present. So, in the product, each term from the first polynomial is multiplied by each term from the second. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial. Because each term in the second polynomial, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), contributes to a term with \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), but the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\) would be the sum of all those contributions. So, in the example I just thought of, if I have \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^0\\) would be 1 times the sum of coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 1 + 1 = 2. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^0c\\) would be 1 \u00d7 1 = 1, and the coefficient of \\(a^2b^0c^{-1}\\) would be 1 \u00d7 1 = 1. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^0\\) regardless of \\(c\\) would be 1 + 1 = 2, which is indeed 1 \u00d7 2. So, applying that logic, in the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\) would be 6 \u00d7 64 = 384. Alternatively, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it's 6 \u00d7 20 = 120. Hmm, I'm still not sure. Let me check the problem again: it says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\". It doesn't specify anything about \\(c\\), so perhaps it's considering the term where \\(c\\) is to the zero power, meaning that the entire term is \\(a^2b^2\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 \u00d7 20 = 120. Alternatively, maybe it's just 6, but that doesn't make sense because the second polynomial contributes a factor. Wait, no, because the second polynomial is being multiplied, so the coefficient would be scaled by the sum of its coefficients. Wait, but in the example I did earlier, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^0\\) regardless of \\(c\\) was 2, which is 1 \u00d7 2, where 2 is the sum of coefficients in the second polynomial. So, applying that, in the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\) would be 6 \u00d7 64 = 384. But I'm not entirely sure. Let me think differently. Maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, which includes all possible terms with \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by any power of \\(c\\). In that case, the coefficient would be 6 times each coefficient from the second polynomial, but that would mean the coefficient varies depending on the power of \\(c\\). But the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which suggests it's considering all terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) appears, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 6 \u00d7 64 = 384. Alternatively, maybe the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 384. Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it, and the answer is simply 6, but that seems unlikely because the second polynomial would contribute a factor. Wait, no, because the second polynomial is being multiplied, so each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial. So, 6 \u00d7 64 = 384. Let me check that with the example again. If I have \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^0\\) is 1 \u00d7 (1 + 1) = 2, as I thought earlier. So, in that case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^0\\) is 2, which is 1 \u00d7 2. Similarly, in the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 \u00d7 64 = 384. So, I think that's the answer. But just to be thorough, let me calculate the sum of coefficients in the second polynomial. The sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of coefficients is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 \u00d7 64 = 384. So, the final answer is 384.\n\nWait, but I just thought of something else. Maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, but in the entire expansion, which would include terms with different powers of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the same as the coefficient in the first polynomial times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial. So, yes, 6 \u00d7 64 = 384. Alternatively, if the problem is only interested in the term where \\(c\\) is to the zero power, then it's 6 \u00d7 20 = 120. But since the problem didn't specify anything about \\(c\\), I think the intended answer is 384. So, I'll go with that.\n\nBut wait, let me make sure. Let me think about the entire expansion. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\) with coefficient 6. Then, when multiplied by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in that expansion will be multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) is 6 \u00d7 coefficient of \\(c^k\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), without any restriction on \\(c\\). So, does that mean it's considering all possible \\(k\\), i.e., the sum over all \\(k\\) of 6 \u00d7 coefficient of \\(c^k\\)? That would be 6 \u00d7 sum of coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 6 \u00d7 64 = 384. Alternatively, if the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it's 6 \u00d7 20 = 120. But since the problem didn't specify \\(c\\), I think it's the former, 384. So, I'll stick with 384.\n\nWait, but now I'm second-guessing myself because in the example I did earlier, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^0\\) regardless of \\(c\\) was 2, which is 1 \u00d7 2, where 2 is the sum of coefficients in the second polynomial. So, similarly, in this problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\) would be 6 \u00d7 64 = 384. So, I think that's correct.\n\nWait, but let me check one more time. Let me compute the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6. Then, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 64. So, 6 \u00d7 64 = 384. That seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, if I were to expand the entire expression, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part, which gives terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the sum of all coefficients from the second polynomial multiplied by 6, which is 6 \u00d7 64 = 384.\n\nSo, I think the answer is 384.\n\nWait, but I just realized that in the example I used earlier, when I had \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^0\\) was 2, which is 1 \u00d7 2, where 2 is the sum of coefficients in the second polynomial. So, in that case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^0\\) regardless of \\(c\\) is 2, which is 1 \u00d7 2. Similarly, in the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\) would be 6 \u00d7 64 = 384. So, I think that's correct.\n\nBut wait, let me think differently. Maybe the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which would be the same as the coefficient in the first polynomial times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second polynomial. Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by \\(c^0\\), you get \\(a^2b^2\\), and that's the only term where \\(a^2b^2\\) appears without any \\(c\\) terms. So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 \u00d7 20 = 120. But I'm not sure which interpretation is correct because the problem didn't specify anything about \\(c\\). It just said \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\". So, perhaps it's expecting the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nWait, but in the example I did earlier, if I have \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^0\\) is 2, which is 1 \u00d7 2, where 2 is the sum of coefficients in the second polynomial. So, in that case, the problem was asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^0\\), regardless of \\(c\\), which was 2. So, by analogy, in the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\), would be 6 \u00d7 64 = 384. So, I think that's the correct approach.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem had asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it would be 6 \u00d7 20 = 120. But since it didn't specify, I think the answer is 384.\n\nWait, but let me think again. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. So, each term in the product would be \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), where \\(k\\) ranges from -6 to 6 in steps of 2. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) is 6 \u00d7 coefficient of \\(c^k\\) in the second polynomial. But the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), without any restriction on \\(c\\). So, perhaps it's considering all possible \\(k\\), meaning that the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 6 \u00d7 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem is only interested in the term where \\(c\\) is to the zero power, then it's 6 \u00d7 20 = 120. But since the problem didn't specify, I think the intended answer is 384.\n\nWait, but let me check with a different approach. Let me compute the product \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) as two separate expansions and see how the coefficients work.\n\nFirst, \\((a + b)^4\\) has terms:\n\n- \\(a^4\\), coefficient 1\n- \\(4a^3b\\), coefficient 4\n- \\(6a^2b^2\\), coefficient 6\n- \\(4ab^3\\), coefficient 4\n- \\(b^4\\), coefficient 1\n\nThen, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) has terms:\n\n- \\(c^6\\), coefficient 1\n- \\(6c^4\\), coefficient 6\n- \\(15c^2\\), coefficient 15\n- \\(20c^0\\), coefficient 20\n- \\(15c^{-2}\\), coefficient 15\n- \\(6c^{-4}\\), coefficient 6\n- \\(c^{-6}\\), coefficient 1\n\nNow, when you multiply these two expansions together, each term from the first is multiplied by each term from the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first polynomial is multiplied by each term from the second polynomial, resulting in terms like \\(6a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(6a^2b^2c^4\\), \\(6a^2b^2c^2\\), \\(6a^2b^2c^0\\), \\(6a^2b^2c^{-2}\\), \\(6a^2b^2c^{-4}\\), \\(6a^2b^2c^{-6}\\).\n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^6\\) is 6 \u00d7 1 = 6\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^4\\) is 6 \u00d7 6 = 36\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^2\\) is 6 \u00d7 15 = 90\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is 6 \u00d7 20 = 120\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^{-2}\\) is 6 \u00d7 15 = 90\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^{-4}\\) is 6 \u00d7 6 = 36\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^{-6}\\) is 6 \u00d7 1 = 6\n\nSo, in the entire expansion, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is present with various powers of \\(c\\), each multiplied by 6 times the corresponding coefficient from the second polynomial.\n\nNow, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). If it's asking for the coefficient regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then it's the sum of all these coefficients, which is 6 + 36 + 90 + 120 + 90 + 36 + 6 = let's calculate that:\n\n6 + 36 = 42\n\n42 + 90 = 132\n\n132 + 120 = 252\n\n252 + 90 = 342\n\n342 + 36 = 378\n\n378 + 6 = 384\n\nSo, the total sum is 384. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 384.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it's 120.\n\nBut since the problem didn't specify anything about \\(c\\), I think the correct interpretation is that it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), which is 384.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplying it by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is \\(2^6 = 64\\). Thus, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{384}."

Wait, but \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are variables separate from \\(c\\), right? So, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are different variables, the only way \\(a^2b^2\\) can appear in the product is if it's multiplied by some term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient would just be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, no, that can't be right because when you multiply, each term from the first expansion is multiplied by each term from the second expansion. But since \\(a^2b^2\\) is just a term without \\(c\\), the coefficient would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all terms in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't make sense because the sum of all terms in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) would be a series in \\(c\\), and when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), it would result in terms involving \\(c\\), but the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again. When you multiply two polynomials together, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum of the products of the coefficients of terms whose exponents add up to that term. So, in this case, I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). But in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). However, since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, that doesn't seem right because the sum of all coefficients in a polynomial is obtained by setting all variables to 1. So, if I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 * 64 = 384. But wait, that seems high. Let me check again. Alternatively, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Perhaps I'm supposed to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some \\(k\\), but the problem just says \\(a^2b^2\\). So, perhaps the problem is only considering the terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any term from the second expansion, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, in that case, the coefficient would indeed be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. But wait, that feels off because when you multiply by each term, you're not just adding the coefficients; you're multiplying each term, which might have different exponents of \\(c\\). But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, then yes, it would be the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all coefficients from the second part. Let me confirm this with a simpler example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^1 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). The expansion would be \\((a + b)(c + 1/c)\\). The coefficient of \\(a\\) would be 1 times the sum of coefficients in \\((c + 1/c)\\), which is 2. So, the coefficient of \\(a\\) in the product would be 1 * 2 = 2. Similarly, the coefficient of \\(b\\) would also be 2. So, yes, in that case, it works. Therefore, applying the same logic, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given problem would be 6 * 64 = 384. Wait, but let me check again. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to have a different interpretation. Maybe it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\). In that case, we would need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, first, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. Then, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is the middle term, which would be when the exponents of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) cancel out. So, in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\times (1/c)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We want the exponent to be 0, so 6 - 2k = 0 => k = 3. Therefore, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, if we're looking for the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\), then the coefficient would be 6 * 20 = 120. But the problem just says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", without specifying anything about \\(c\\). So, that's a bit ambiguous. It could mean either:\n\n1. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), which would be 6 * 64 = 384, or\n\n2. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nBut usually, when a problem asks for the coefficient of a term like \\(a^2b^2\\) in a product involving other variables, it's often looking for the term where the other variables cancel out, i.e., \\(c^0\\). So, I think the intended answer is 120. Let me check that again.\n\nFirst, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6.\n\nIn \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20.\n\nTherefore, when you multiply, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but only the term with \\(c^0\\) will result in a term \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). All other terms would have \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by some power of \\(c\\), which would make the term \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) where \\(k \\neq 0\\). Since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and not \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), it's ambiguous. However, in many algebra problems, when only part of the variables are specified, it's often implied that the other variables are to be set to a value that cancels them out, typically 1 or 0. But in this case, since \\(c\\) is in the denominator, setting \\(c = 1\\) would make it disappear. So, perhaps the intended interpretation is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), then it's 384. But that seems less likely because usually, when you have multiple variables, you specify all of them unless otherwise stated.\n\nTo resolve this, let me think about the structure of the problem. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, when you expand this, you'll have terms like \\(a^kb^{4 - k} \\times c^m\\), where \\(k\\) ranges from 0 to 4, and \\(m\\) ranges such that \\(c^m\\) comes from the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\).\n\nIf the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), then that would correspond to \\(k = 2\\), so \\(a^2b^2\\), and for each \\(m\\), the term would be \\(a^2b^2c^m\\). But if the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\), then the coefficient would be the sum over all \\(m\\) of the coefficients of \\(a^2b^2c^m\\). But that's not standard. Normally, when you ask for the coefficient of a monomial, you specify all the variables. So, perhaps the problem is mistyped, and it should be \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). Alternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to have only \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms, but that's not the case here.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is written correctly, and I'm overcomplicating. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\).\" So, it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), without any mention of \\(c\\). So, in the expanded form, any term that has \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by any power of \\(c\\) would contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). As I calculated earlier, the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is obtained by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\(2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient would be 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nBut wait, let me think again. When you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a term in the product is the sum of the products of the coefficients of terms whose exponents add up to that term. So, in this case, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product comes from multiplying \\(a^2b^2\\) from \\((a + b)^4\\) by any term from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient would indeed be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem had asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), it would have been 6 * 20 = 120. But since it's just \\(a^2b^2\\), I think the correct interpretation is 384.\n\nWait, but let me confirm this with a simpler example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^1 \\times (c + 1/c)^1 = (a + b)(c + 1/c)\\). The expansion would be \\(ac + a/c + bc + b/c\\). Now, the coefficient of \\(a\\) would be \\(c + 1/c\\), but that's a term with \\(c\\). However, if I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a\\) regardless of \\(c\\), then it's the sum of the coefficients of \\(a\\) times each term in the second polynomial. But in reality, each term has a different power of \\(c\\). So, perhaps the problem is intended to have \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is written incorrectly, and it should be \\((a + b + c)^4\\), but that's not the case here.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\). So, to find that, we need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), then multiply them together.\n\nAs I calculated earlier, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\nThe coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is found by expanding \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). The general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - k}(1/c)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\\). We want the exponent to be 0, so 6 - 2k = 0 => k = 3. Therefore, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nBut the problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", not \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). So, I'm back to the ambiguity. If the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then it's 384. If it's asking for \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), it's 120.\n\nGiven that the problem includes \\(c\\) in the expression, but only asks for \\(a^2b^2\\), I think the intended answer is 120, assuming that the term \\(c^0\\) is implied. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is written incorrectly, and it's supposed to be \\((a + b + c)^4\\), but that's not the case here.\n\nWait, perhaps I can think of it differently. When you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the sum of all coefficients of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for all \\(k\\). But that's equivalent to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, without considering \\(c\\), then it's 384. But if it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), it's 120.\n\nGiven that the problem includes \\(c\\) in the expression, but only asks for \\(a^2b^2\\), I'm starting to think that the intended answer is 120, as the problem likely expects the term where \\(c\\) cancels out. So, perhaps the problem is assuming that \\(c\\) is set to 1, or that we're only interested in the constant term with respect to \\(c\\).\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider that when the problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", it's referring to the coefficient in the entire expression, which would include all powers of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient would be 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but in reality, when you have a term like \\(a^2b^2\\), it's a term without any \\(c\\), so in the product, it would be \\(a^2b^2\\) times the sum of all terms in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) has a different power of \\(c\\), so when you multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), you get terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for various \\(k\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is not a single number, because \\(a^2b^2\\) is part of multiple terms with different powers of \\(c\\). Therefore, perhaps the problem is intended to ask for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is written incorrectly, and it's supposed to be \\((a + b + c)^4\\), but that's not the case here.\n\nWait, perhaps I should look for similar problems. Typically, when you have a product of two polynomials and you're asked for the coefficient of a term that doesn't involve another variable, it's implied that you're looking for the term where the other variable is set to a value that eliminates it, often 1. So, in this case, setting \\(c = 1\\) would eliminate \\(c\\), and then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, regardless of \\(c\\), which would be the same as 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nBut I'm still unsure because the problem includes \\(c\\), so it's a bit ambiguous. However, given that the problem is written as it is, I think the correct interpretation is that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 384.\n\nWait, but let me check another way. Let's expand \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) separately, then see how the coefficients multiply.\n\nFirst, \\((a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\).\n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6.\n\nNow, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - k}(1/c)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\\).\n\nSo, when we multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), resulting in terms like \\(6a^2b^2c^{6 - 2k}\\) for \\(k = 0\\) to \\(6\\).\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but that seems to be the case. Each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) has a coefficient, and when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), it contributes to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^{something}\\). But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), the total coefficient would be the sum of all these contributions, which is 6 times the sum of coefficients in the second polynomial.\n\nTherefore, I think the correct answer is 384.\n\nBut earlier, I thought it might be 120, considering only the \\(c^0\\) term. But now, upon further reflection, I think 384 is the correct answer because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, every term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present, regardless of the \\(c\\) exponent, contributes to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, it's 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me think about how the coefficients work in the product. When you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term is the sum of the products of coefficients of terms whose exponents add up to that term. So, in this case, to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), we need to consider all possible ways to get \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. That is, from \\((a + b)^4\\), we have \\(a^2b^2\\) with coefficient 6, and from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), we have all possible terms, each with their own coefficients. So, when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each such multiplication contributes to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some \\(k\\). But if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), then it's the sum of all these coefficients, which is 6 times the sum of coefficients in the second polynomial.\n\nBut that doesn't make sense because in the product, each term has a specific power of \\(c\\). So, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nWait, perhaps I should look at the problem again. It says: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\).\" So, it's possible that the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). In that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), it's 120.\n\nBut since the problem didn't specify \\(c^0\\), I think it's more likely that it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), which would be 384.\n\nWait, but let's think about how the product works. When you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the sum of all these coefficients, which is 6 times the sum of coefficients in the second polynomial. Therefore, the answer is 384.\n\nBut I'm still a bit confused because in standard problems, when you're asked for the coefficient of a term that doesn't include another variable, it's usually implied that the other variable is set to 1 or that you're looking for the constant term. But in this case, since the problem includes \\(c\\), it's ambiguous.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider that when you have a product of two polynomials, the coefficient of a term in one polynomial times the entire other polynomial is the coefficient times the sum of the other polynomial's coefficients. So, in this case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 64, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So, I think the answer is 384.\n\nWait, but let me check with another approach. Let's compute the entire expansion up to the necessary terms.\n\nFirst, \\((a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\).\n\nNow, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15/c^2 + 6/c^4 + 1/c^6\\).\n\nNow, when we multiply these two, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first polynomial will be multiplied by each term in the second polynomial, resulting in:\n\n6a^2b^2c^6 + 6*6a^2b^2c^4 + 6*15a^2b^2c^2 + 6*20a^2b^2 + 6*15a^2b^2/c^2 + 6*6a^2b^2/c^4 + 6*1/c^6a^2b^2.\n\nBut the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, if we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, it would be the sum of all coefficients from each of these terms. So, that would be 6 + 36 + 90 + 120 + 90 + 36 + 6 = 384.\n\nYes, that adds up to 384. So, that confirms that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 384.\n\nTherefore, after all this thinking, I conclude that the coefficient is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6. Then, since the problem asks for the coefficient regardless of the power of \\(c\\), we consider the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 64. Multiplying these gives \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\(\\boxed{384}\\)."

    "text": " But since I'm only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I don't need to worry about the \\(c\\) terms when considering the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\), right? Wait, no, actually, the entire expression is the product of the two expansions, so I need to consider how they multiply together. But wait, the \\(c\\) terms are separate from \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), so when I multiply the two expressions together, the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) will multiply with the terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). However, since I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), the \\(c\\) terms will just be coefficients multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Wait, no, that's not quite right. Because when you multiply two expressions, each term from the first expression gets multiplied by each term from the second expression. But since I'm only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), that term will come from multiplying the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in \\((a + b)^4\\) by the constant term (i.e., the term with \\(c^0\\)) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Because if I multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by any term involving \\(c\\), it would result in a term like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), which isn't \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is to multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by the term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) that has \\(c^0\\). Therefore, I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), then multiply it by 6, which is the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\). So, let's find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Again, using the binomial theorem, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(1/c\\right)^m\\). Simplifying the exponents: \\(c^{6 - m} \\times c^{-m} = c^{6 - 2m}\\). We want the term where the exponent is 0, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\): \\(6 = 2m\\) => \\(m = 3\\). So, the constant term is when \\(m = 3\\), and the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20. Now, going back to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) and the constant term from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). That is, 6 * 20 = 120. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120. Wait, let me just make sure I didn't make a mistake. So, the coefficient in \\((a + b)^4\\) for \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, correct. The constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 20, correct. Multiplying them gives 120. That seems right. Alternatively, if I think about the entire expansion, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), so the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) is by taking the \\(a^2b^2\\) term and multiplying it by the \\(c^0\\) term, which is 20, so 6*20=120. Yep, that makes sense. So, I think 120 is the correct coefficient.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Multiplying these gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

But the problem is specifically asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which suggests that we're looking for all terms where \\(a\\) is squared and \\(b\\) is squared, regardless of the power of \\(c\\). But that might not make sense because in the product, each term would have specific powers of \\(c\\) as well. Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me read the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, it's possible that the question is only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. That is, when you expand the entire expression, collect all terms that have \\(a^2b^2\\), and then sum their coefficients. Alternatively, maybe the question is considering \\(c\\) as another variable, and it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times any power of \\(c\\). But that would mean that the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which seems unlikely. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, without considering the \\(c\\) terms, meaning that the coefficient is 6, as I found earlier, because the \\(c\\) part doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) coefficients. Wait, that seems too simple. Let me think again. When you multiply two polynomials, the coefficients of the terms in one polynomial affect the coefficients in the other. But in this case, \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) are being multiplied, and since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are different variables, the coefficients of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) in the first part are independent of the coefficients in the second part. So, when you multiply them, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems odd because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, not an expression involving \\(c\\). So, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Maybe it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), that is, the term where \\(a\\) is squared, \\(b\\) is squared, and \\(c\\) is to the zero power. That would make sense because then the coefficient would be a number, not involving \\(c\\). So, let me try that approach. So, to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), I can proceed as follows. First, find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, as I found before. Then, find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because when I multiply these two parts together, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) will be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion. So, let me calculate the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be 0, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which implies \\(m = 3\\). So, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Wait, but the problem didn't specify \\(c^0\\), it just said \\(a^2b^2\\). So, maybe I was wrong earlier, and the problem is indeed asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). But that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial in \\(c\\), so the coefficient would be a polynomial, not a number. That seems unlikely because the problem is asking for a coefficient, which is usually a number. So, perhaps the problem is intended to ask for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be 120. Alternatively, maybe the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, without considering \\(c\\), which would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't make much sense because the coefficients in the second expression are tied to specific powers of \\(c\\). So, I think the intended interpretation is that we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. Let me confirm this. When you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) where \\(k\\) ranges from -6 to 6 in steps of 2. But if we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), without any \\(c\\) terms, that would correspond to \\(k = 0\\), so the term \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). Therefore, the coefficient is indeed 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion, which is 6 * 20 = 120. So, I think the answer is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe problem asks for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nFirst, expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem.

The term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0 occurs when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), so \\(m = 3\\). The coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n\nMultiplying these coefficients together gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

Let me check the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). That is, in the expanded form of the entire expression, what is the coefficient for the term that has \\(a^2b^2\\), and any power of \\(c\\). But that seems a bit odd because the term would have both \\(a^2b^2\\) and some power of \\(c\\). Wait, but maybe the problem is only concerned with the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) parts and doesn't care about \\(c\\). Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times any term from the \\(c\\) part, meaning that the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, that might be possible. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\), which is 1. That would make sense because then the coefficient would be a constant. Let me think about that. So, if I'm looking for the term \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), that would be the product of \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part and the constant term (i.e., the term with \\(c^0\\)) from the second part. So, in that case, I would need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), then multiply it by the coefficient 6 from the first part. That seems plausible. Let me check: So, first, from \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. Then, from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the constant term is when the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out. Let me compute that. Using the binomial theorem again: \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the exponent of \\(c\\) is \\(6 - 2m\\). We want the exponent to be 0, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which gives \\(m = 3\\). So, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20. Therefore, the term \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product would be \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). So, the coefficient is 120. Wait, but let me make sure I'm interpreting the problem correctly. The problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", without specifying any particular power of \\(c\\). So, does that mean that I need to consider all possible terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any power of \\(c\\), and sum their coefficients? That would be a different approach. Let me think about that. So, in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) has a coefficient of 6, and in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term is of the form \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, when I multiply these two expansions together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in the \\(c\\) expansion, resulting in terms like \\(6 \\times \\dbinom{6}{m} a^2b^2c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) across all powers of \\(c\\) would be the sum of all coefficients from the \\(c\\) expansion multiplied by 6. But that would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The sum of the coefficients in a polynomial is found by setting all variables to 1. So, let me compute \\(\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of the coefficients is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) across all powers of \\(c\\) would be 6 \u00d7 64 = 384. But wait, that seems too high. Let me check if that's the correct interpretation. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), meaning that it's 6 times the entire expansion of the \\(c\\) terms. But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. Therefore, maybe the correct interpretation is that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120, as I calculated earlier. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only concerned with the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms and doesn't care about \\(c\\), in which case the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that would result in the coefficient being a polynomial, which doesn't make sense. Therefore, the more plausible interpretation is that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times the constant term in \\(c\\), so the answer would be 6 \u00d7 20 = 120. Let me confirm this by another approach. Let's consider the entire expression: \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\) with coefficient 6. Now, when we multiply this by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the product will be \\(6 \\times \\dbinom{6}{m} a^2b^2c^{6 - 2m}\\), where \\(m\\) ranges from 0 to 6. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the sum over all \\(m\\) of \\(6 \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}\\). Wait, but that would be 6 times the sum of \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\) for \\(m = 0\\) to 6, which is 6 \u00d7 2^6 = 6 \u00d7 64 = 384. But that contradicts my earlier conclusion of 120. Hmm, now I'm confused. Let me think again. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but in the entire product, each term will have \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by some power of \\(c\\). So, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then it's 6 \u00d7 (sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)), which is 6 \u00d7 64 = 384. But if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it's 6 \u00d7 20 = 120. So, which interpretation is correct? The problem states: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" It doesn't specify any power of \\(c\\), so perhaps it's considering all possible powers of \\(c\\), meaning that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of the \\(c\\) terms. But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, which doesn't make sense because a coefficient should be a scalar. Therefore, the problem must be asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\). Therefore, the correct approach is to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20, and multiply it by 6, giving 120. So, the coefficient is 120. To make sure, let me compute it step by step again. From \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). From \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the constant term is when the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0. Using the binomial theorem, the general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\times \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). Setting \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), we get \\(m = 3\\). So, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by the constant term gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). So, the coefficient is 120. Alternatively, if I consider that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) irrespective of the power of \\(c\\), then it's 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that would make the coefficient a polynomial, which doesn't make sense. Therefore, the correct interpretation is that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. So, after all that, I think the answer is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplying it by the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20. Therefore, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\boxed{120}"

    "text": " But since the question is only asking about the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I think the part involving \\(c\\) might not affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, is that right? Let me think. When you multiply two expressions together, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression. So, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by every term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and not considering any \\(c\\) terms, I think we're only interested in the part where the \\(a^2b^2\\) term is multiplied by the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because if we multiply by any \\(c\\) terms, that would change the variables, right? So, for example, if we have \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by \\(c^k\\) or \\(\\dfrac{1}{c^k}\\), that would give us terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2 \\dfrac{1}{c^k}\\), which are not just \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the only term that contributes to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is when we multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me figure that out. Again, using the binomial theorem, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying that, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m} = \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the exponent of \\(c\\) in each term is \\(6 - 2m\\). We need the term where the exponent is zero because that's the constant term. So, set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is when \\(m = 3\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Let me compute that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20. Therefore, when we multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term by this constant term, we get \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120. Wait, let me double-check to make sure I didn't make a mistake. First, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6. Then, in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the constant term is when the exponent is zero, which is at \\(m = 3\\), giving \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying these together gives 6 * 20 = 120. That seems correct. So, yeah, the coefficient should be 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is found by expanding \\((a + b)^4\\) and identifying the term with \\(a^2b^2\\), which has a coefficient of 6. Next, we find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20. Multiplying these coefficients together gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{120}"

    "text": " But since we're only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), maybe the \\(c\\) terms don't affect that part? Wait, no, actually, when you multiply two expressions together, each term from the first expression gets multiplied by each term from the second expression. So, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in \\((a + b)^4\\) would be multiplied by every term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product.

Or maybe I'm misunderstanding. Wait, no, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. That is, when you multiply the two expansions together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't make sense because the question is asking for a coefficient, which is a number, not an expression. Wait, maybe I'm misinterpreting the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" Hmm, so perhaps the problem is treating \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\), and \\(1/c\\) as separate variables, and we're looking for the coefficient of the term where \\(a\\) is squared, \\(b\\) is squared, and \\(c\\) is to some power? But that seems complicated. Alternatively, maybe the problem is only asking about the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). But that would mean the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which would be a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem just says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", so perhaps it's expecting a numerical coefficient, treating \\(c\\) terms as part of the coefficient. Wait, that might make sense. Let me think. So, when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, which is a polynomial in \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that seems odd because the coefficient is a number, but here it's a polynomial. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only considering the coefficient in the combined expression, treating all variables as separate, and wants the coefficient where \\(a^2b^2\\) appears, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. But that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but that doesn't seem right either. Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me approach it differently. Perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which would involve considering all possible terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. But then, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 times \\(2^6 = 64\\), since each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) has a coefficient that's either 1 or something else, but when you sum all coefficients, you set \\(c = 1\\), so \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). So, then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 * 64 = 384. Wait, but that seems too high. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, considering all the \\(c\\) terms as part of the coefficient. But that doesn't make sense because the coefficient should be a number, not a polynomial. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting just the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and the rest is not relevant because \\(c\\) is another variable. But that seems unlikely because the entire expression is given as the product. Wait, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in other words, when you multiply the two expansions, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, which doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only considering the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), and then the second part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), is just a separate factor, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that seems incorrect because the coefficient should be a number. Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me try to parse it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of the term where \\(a\\) is squared, \\(b\\) is squared, and the \\(c\\) terms are whatever they are. But then, that would mean the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient, which is a number, so perhaps it's expecting the coefficient to be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 times \\(2^6 = 64\\), so 384. Alternatively, maybe it's 6 times the middle term or something. Wait, perhaps I should compute \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) and find its expansion, then multiply by 6 and see what the coefficient is. Let me try that.\n\nFirst, let's expand \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem. The expansion is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(1/c\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, the general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\) for \\(k = 0\\) to \\(6\\). So, the expansion is:\n\n- \\(k=0\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{0} c^{6} = 1 \\cdot c^6\\)\n- \\(k=1\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{1} c^{4} = 6c^4\\)\n- \\(k=2\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{2} c^{2} = 15c^2\\)\n- \\(k=3\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} c^{0} = 20\\)\n- \\(k=4\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{4} c^{-2} = 15c^{-2}\\)\n- \\(k=5\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{5} c^{-4} = 6c^{-4}\\)\n- \\(k=6\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{6} c^{-6} = 1c^{-6}\\)\n\nSo, the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is \\(c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15/c^2 + 6/c^4 + 1/c^6\\).\n\nNow, going back to the original problem: \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). We've already found that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. Now, when we multiply this by the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in the expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product will be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Wait, but is that correct? Let me think. When you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the expansion, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^{6 - 2k}\\) would be 6 times the coefficient from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then it's 6 times the entire expansion, which would be a polynomial. But if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by a specific power of \\(c\\), say \\(c^m\\), then it's 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^m\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But the problem doesn't specify a particular power of \\(c\\), so maybe it's just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. But that would mean the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion, which is a polynomial, not a number. So, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, so the coefficient would be 6 times each term from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the coefficient should be a number.

But that seems odd.\n\nWait, perhaps I should look at it differently. Maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, when you multiply the two expansions, each term from \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, which doesn't make sense because the coefficient should be a number. So, perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and the rest is irrelevant. But that seems unlikely because the problem includes the \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) part.\n\nWait, maybe I should think of it as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which would be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). The sum of the coefficients in a polynomial is found by setting all variables to 1. So, in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), setting \\(c = 1\\) gives \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of the coefficients is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 * 64 = 384. So, the coefficient is 384.\n\nWait, but let me check that again. If I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of the coefficients is 64. Therefore, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 * 64 = 384. That seems correct. Alternatively, if I think of it as the coefficient being 6 times each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the entire expansion, which is a polynomial. But the problem is asking for the coefficient, which is a number, so it must be 384.\n\nWait, but let me think again. When you have two polynomials multiplied together, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum of the products of the coefficients of terms whose exponents add up to that term. But in this case, we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is only present in \\((a + b)^4\\), and when multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a number. So, perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and the rest is irrelevant. But that seems odd because the problem includes the other part.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is written incorrectly, or I'm misinterpreting it. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where \\(c\\) is raised to the zero power. That would make sense because then the coefficient would be a number. So, let's try that approach. So, we need the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, that would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, from \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, as we found earlier. From \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is the term where the exponent is zero, which is when \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), so \\(k = 3\\). So, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product is 6 * 20 = 120. So, maybe that's the answer.\n\nWait, but the problem didn't specify \\(c^0\\), it just said \\(a^2b^2\\). So, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but that seems incorrect. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and the rest is not relevant. But that seems unlikely because the problem includes the other part.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, considering all possible powers of \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial. But the problem is asking for the coefficient, which should be a number, so that can't be right. Therefore, I think the correct interpretation is that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which would involve multiplying by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but since the problem doesn't specify a particular power of \\(c\\), perhaps it's only asking for the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6. But that seems too simple.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting me to consider that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but that would be a polynomial, not a number. Therefore, I think the correct approach is to interpret the problem as asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but since the problem is asking for a number, perhaps it's expecting the sum of the coefficients, which is 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and the rest is irrelevant. But that seems odd.\n\nWait, let me check online or recall if I've seen similar problems before. I think in similar problems, when you have a product of two expressions, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each expression, provided the variables multiply appropriately. But in this case, the variables are separate: \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are in one part, and \\(c\\) is in the other. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), so when you multiply by the other expression, which is in terms of \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a number. Therefore, perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and the rest is irrelevant. But that seems too simplistic.\n\nWait, maybe I should think of it as the coefficient being 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times each term in the expansion, so the coefficient would be 6 times \\(c^6\\), 6 times \\(6c^4\\), etc. But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a number. Therefore, I think the correct interpretation is that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and the other part is just a separate factor, so the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But since the problem is asking for a number, perhaps it's expecting just 6. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is written incorrectly, and it's supposed to ask for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be 120, as I calculated earlier.\n\nWait, let me try to clarify. If the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, then it's 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial. But the problem is asking for the coefficient, which should be a number, so perhaps it's expecting the sum of the coefficients, which is 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, if it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it's 6 * 20 = 120. I think the most reasonable interpretation is that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, so the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me check: when you have two polynomials multiplied together, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum of the products of the coefficients of terms whose exponents add up to that term. But in this case, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), so when you multiply by the other polynomial, each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient is a polynomial, which is 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient, which is a number, so perhaps it's expecting the sum of the coefficients, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and the rest is irrelevant. But that seems too simple, and the problem includes the other part. Therefore, I think the correct answer is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384. So, the coefficient is 384.\n\nWait, but let me confirm this. If I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = 64\\), and the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product when \\(c = 1\\) is 6 * 64 = 384. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 384.\n\nWait, but that doesn't seem right because when \\(c = 1\\), the entire product becomes \\((a + b)^4 * 64\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 * 64 = 384. So, that seems correct. Therefore, the answer is 384.\n\nBut earlier, I thought it might be 120 if considering \\(c^0\\). So, perhaps I should clarify. If the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it's 6 * 20 = 120. But if it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then it's 6 * 64 = 384. Since the problem didn't specify, I think it's more likely that it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), so the answer is 384.\n\nWait, but let me check another way. Let's consider the entire product:\n\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\left(\\sum_{i=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{i} a^{4 - i}b^i\\right) \\times \\left(\\sum_{j=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{j} c^{6 - 2j}\\right)\n\\]\n\nSo, the general term in the product is \\(\\dbinom{4}{i} \\dbinom{6}{j} a^{4 - i}b^i c^{6 - 2j}\\).\n\nWe need the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which occurs when \\(4 - i = 2\\) and \\(i = 2\\). So, for \\(a^2b^2\\), \\(i = 2\\), and the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Now, for each \\(j\\) from 0 to 6, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by \\(\\dbinom{6}{j} c^{6 - 2j}\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is \\(6 \\times \\sum_{j=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{j}\\), which is \\(6 \\times 2^6 = 6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\nYes, that makes sense. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplying it by the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is \\(2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n$\\boxed{384}$"

    "text": " But wait, the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so maybe the part involving \\(c\\) doesn't affect that term? Hmm, let me think. When I multiply two expressions together, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression. So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I need to consider how this term is affected by the multiplication. But actually, \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), so the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are independent of the terms involving \\(c\\). That means the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, no, that doesn't sound right because when you multiply two polynomials, each term from the first is multiplied by each term from the second. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), maybe the \\(c\\) terms don't affect the coefficient? Wait, actually, no, because the entire expression is a product. So, when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) gets multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part would be multiplied by every term in the second part. But since we're just looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, that would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire second part. Wait, but that would make the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) equal to 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, not an expression involving \\(c\\). Hmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" Oh, maybe the question is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, which would include all the terms from both parts. But since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), perhaps the coefficient is just the product of the coefficients from each part? Wait, no, that doesn't make sense either. Let me try a different approach. Maybe I should first find the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) and then the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), and then look for the term where the product includes \\(a^2b^2\\). But since the two parts are multiplied together, the \\(c\\) terms don't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be the same as in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't seem right because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again. Perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, but since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are all variables, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by every possible term from the second part, which includes \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire second part, which would be a series in \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, so maybe I'm misunderstanding. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). Wait, that might be the case. So, maybe I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, considering all possible terms, which would involve summing over the coefficients from the second expansion. Let me try that approach. So, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me denote the first part as \\(P = (a + b)^4\\) and the second part as \\(Q = \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Now, when I expand \\(P \\times Q\\), each term in \\(P\\) will be multiplied by each term in \\(Q\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(P\\) has a coefficient of 6, as we found earlier. Now, when we multiply this by each term in \\(Q\\), which is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in \\(Q\\) is of the form \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, each term in \\(Q\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\\) for \\(k = 0\\) to \\(6\\). Therefore, when we multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term by each term in \\(Q\\), we get \\(6 \\times \\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k} a^2b^2\\). But since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), that coefficient would be the sum over all \\(k\\) of \\(6 \\times \\dbinom{6}{k}\\). Wait, no, that can't be right because each term in \\(Q\\) contributes a different power of \\(c\\), but the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually be the sum of the coefficients from each term in \\(Q\\) multiplied by 6. But that would mean the coefficient is \\(6 \\times \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k}\\). But \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k}\\) is equal to \\(2^6 = 64\\). So, the coefficient would be \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). Wait, but that seems too high. Let me check again. Alternatively, maybe I'm supposed to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without considering the \\(c\\) terms, which would mean that the coefficient is just 6, and the rest of the expression is separate. But the problem says \"in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)\", so it's possible that the coefficient is just 6, and the \\(c\\) terms are part of the overall expression, but since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient remains 6. Hmm, but that seems contradictory because when you multiply by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), you're scaling the entire expression, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually be 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, so maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, considering all variables, but that doesn't make sense because \\(a^2b^2\\) is independent of \\(c\\). Wait, maybe the problem is actually to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating \\(c\\) as a constant. But that would mean the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which would be a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, so perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Maybe the problem is just to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and the rest is irrelevant because \\(c\\) is another variable. But that seems too simple, and the problem includes both parts, so maybe I should consider that the entire expression is a product, and the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a function of \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense for a numerical coefficient. I'm getting confused here. Let me try another approach. Let's consider that when you multiply two expressions, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part comes from the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6a\u00b2b\u00b2. Now, when we multiply this by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - k}(1/c)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, the product would be 6a\u00b2b\u00b2 multiplied by each of these terms, resulting in terms like 6\\dbinom{6}{k}a\u00b2b\u00b2c^{6 - 2k}. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 multiplied by the sum of \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}\\) for all \\(k\\) from 0 to 6, because each term contributes a coefficient to \\(a^2b^2\\). But the sum of \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}\\) from \\(k = 0\\) to \\(6\\) is \\(2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient would be 6 * 64 = 384. Wait, that seems high, but let me check again. Alternatively, perhaps I'm supposed to consider that the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is only multiplied by the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). The constant term occurs when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, which happens when \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 * 20 = 120. Hmm, that seems more reasonable. Let me think: when you multiply by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the only term that doesn't involve \\(c\\) is the constant term, which is when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the constant term from the second part. So, that would be 6 * 20 = 120. That makes sense because only the constant term would allow \\(a^2b^2\\) to remain as a term without any \\(c\\) factors. So, I think that's the correct approach. Therefore, the coefficient is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by considering the binomial expansion of each part. \n\n1. Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n\n2.

The coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n\n3. Multiply the coefficients from each part:\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 20 = 120\n   \\]\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

But since the second polynomial is in terms of \\(c\\), and we're only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), maybe we can just consider the coefficient from the first part and then see how it interacts with the second part. Wait, but actually, no, because the entire expression is the product of both expansions. So, perhaps I need to consider the entire expansion. Wait, but the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, that would mean that any term in the second expansion that doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\) would just multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term.

Wait, but that can't be right because \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by various powers of \\(c\\), so the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually appear multiple times with different powers of \\(c\\). But wait, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, treating \\(c\\) as another variable. Hmm, but that would mean that the coefficient would actually be a polynomial in \\(c\\). But that seems complicated. Wait, perhaps I misread the problem. Let me check again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, it's possible that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, in other words, when we expand the entire product, how many times does \\(a^2b^2\\) appear, and what is the coefficient? But since the second part only involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first part would be multiplied by every term in the second expansion, which includes various powers of \\(c\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually be multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), meaning that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that seems too broad. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), that is, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\). That would make more sense because otherwise, the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\), which is probably not intended. So, perhaps I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\) in the entire product. That would make the problem more meaningful. So, let me proceed under that assumption. So, first, from \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, as I found earlier. Now, in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\), which is the constant term. Because when I multiply 6 by this constant term, it will contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). So, let me find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Again, using the binomial theorem, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(1/c\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the exponent of \\(c\\) in each term is \\(6 - 2m\\). We want the term where the exponent is 0, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which gives \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire product is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is 120. Wait, but let me double-check. The problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", but if we're considering the entire expression, which includes \\(c\\) terms, then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually be a polynomial in \\(c\\). However, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms, then it's 120. Alternatively, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, then it's 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which would make the coefficient a polynomial. But that seems unlikely because the problem probably expects a numerical coefficient. So, I think the intended interpretation is that we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. So, I think that's the answer.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we proceed as follows:\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\), so its coefficient is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\n   \\]\n\n2. **Find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   Using the binomial theorem:\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n   \\]\n   The constant term occurs when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which gives \\(m = 3\\).

Hmm, perhaps I just need to consider the coefficients separately. Let me think. So, the entire expression is the product of two expansions: \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When I multiply these two, each term from the first expansion will multiply each term from the second expansion. But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), maybe I only need to consider the constant term in the second expansion. Wait, is that right? Because if I have \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part, and then multiply by, say, \\(c^k\\) from the second part, the resulting term would be \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), which isn't the same as \\(a^2b^2\\). So, perhaps the only way to get a term with just \\(a^2b^2\\) is if the second part contributes a term with \\(c^0\\), which is 1. So, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me check that. So, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) can also be expanded using the binomial theorem. Let me write that out: \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying that, each term becomes \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m} = \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, I need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be zero, which means \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), \\(6 = 2m\\) so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\).

Now, going back to the original problem, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion has a coefficient of 6, and the term \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion has a coefficient of 20.

So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first expansion, and the \\(c^0\\) term comes from the second expansion. So, when I multiply them, I get \\(a^2b^2 \\times 1\\), which is \\(a^2b^2\\), and the coefficient is 6 times 20, which is indeed 120. Hmm, that seems right. Let me just make sure I didn't make any mistakes in the calculations. So, \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\), that's correct. \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\), that's also correct. So, 6 times 20 is 120.

So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) would be multiplied by every term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). However, the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, in other words, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, that doesn't make sense because \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is a separate part, so the \\(a^2b^2\\) term would just be multiplied by each term in that expansion, but the coefficient would be the product of the coefficients. Wait, no, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is being multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), so the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, is that correct? Let me think again. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When you expand this, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) contributes its coefficient multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the total coefficient would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But how do I find the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)? Well, the sum of the coefficients in a polynomial is found by setting all variables to 1. So, if I substitute \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = (2)^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 times 64, which is 384. Wait, but let me check that again. Because when you have \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the coefficient would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Since the second part, when expanded, has terms with different powers of \\(c\\), but when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), each term becomes \\(a^2b^2 \\times \\text{something}\\). But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, that is, the coefficient is just the product of the coefficients from each part. Wait, no, actually, that's not quite right. Because when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficients combine. So, in this case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial. Because each term in the second polynomial is being multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), so the total coefficient would be the product of the two coefficients. So, yes, 6 times 64 is 384. Therefore, the coefficient is 384. Wait, but let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. Let me consider a simpler case. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^1 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, expanding, it's \\((a + b)(c + 1/c)\\). The coefficient of \\(a^1b^0\\) would be 1 times the sum of coefficients in \\((c + 1/c)\\), which is 2, so 2. Similarly, the coefficient of \\(a^0b^1\\) would also be 1 times 2, so 2. But in reality, when you expand, each term is \\(a c + a (1/c) + b c + b (1/c)\\). So, the coefficients for \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are each 2, which matches. So, in that case, the coefficient of \\(a\\) is 1 times the sum of coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 2. So, that seems correct. Similarly, in our problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times 64, which is 384. So, I think that's correct. Therefore, the final answer is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), giving \\(2^6 = 64\\). Multiplying these gives \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n\\(\\boxed{384}\\)"

That suggests that maybe the term \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), so perhaps when we multiply by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), we're looking for the constant term, i.e., the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. Because if we take \\(a^2b^2\\) and multiply it by some term from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the only way the resulting term will have no \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\) is if we take the constant term from that part. So, let me check that. So, I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Again, using the binomial theorem: \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(1/c\\right)^m\\). Simplifying the exponents: \\(c^{6 - m} \\times c^{-m} = c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero is when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which gives \\(m = 3\\). So, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20. Therefore, when we multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by the constant term 20 from the second part. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Wait, let me double-check that. So, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. In \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the constant term is 20. So, when we multiply these two parts together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will multiply by 20, giving \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). That seems correct. Alternatively, I could think of the entire expression as a product, so each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But since we're only interested in \\(a^2b^2\\), we can ignore the \\(c\\) terms because they won't contribute to \\(a^2b^2\\); they'll just add other variables. So, the coefficient is indeed 120.

So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I need to consider how this term interacts with the second expression \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term that's only in the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), and the second part is in terms of \\(c\\). So, when I multiply them together, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part will be multiplied by every term in the second part. But since the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), perhaps the \\(c\\) terms don't matter because they are variables separate from \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). Wait, but that doesn't seem right. Let me think again. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, if I expand both parts, each term from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term from the second expansion. But the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, which are all terms in \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the entire second part, because every term in the second part will multiply \\(a^2b^2\\), resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2 \\times 1/c^k\\). But wait, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or anything else. So, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, because the \\(c\\) terms don't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) exponents. Wait, that might not be correct. Let me think again. If I have \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), then when I expand the entire expression, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term from the second part. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Wait, that might not be right either because each term in the second part has a coefficient, and when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term, you're effectively scaling \\(a^2b^2\\) by each of those coefficients. So, the total coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the sum of the coefficients in the second part. But wait, the second part is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Let me find the sum of its coefficients. The sum of the coefficients in a polynomial is found by setting all variables to 1. So, if I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(1 + 1/1\\right)^6 = (2)^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of the coefficients in the second part is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 (from the first part) times 64 (sum of coefficients in the second part), which is 6 * 64 = 384. Wait, but that seems too straightforward. Let me check again. Alternatively, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. It says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\)\". So, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of the term that has \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). In that case, the coefficient would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the entire second part, because when you multiply, each term in the second part will scale \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the entire \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but that doesn't make sense because then the coefficient would be a polynomial, not a single number. So, perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, considering all possible terms, but that would require more work. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me clarify: The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so in the entire product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by every term from the second expression. So, each term in the second expression has a coefficient, and when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), it becomes \\(a^2b^2 \\times\\) (some term in \\(c\\)). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the sum of all coefficients in the second part, because each term in the second part contributes a coefficient that scales \\(a^2b^2\\). So, as I calculated before, the sum of coefficients in the second part is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 384. Wait, but let me confirm this by expanding both expressions and seeing how the terms interact. Alternatively, maybe I should consider that the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\), so it's effectively the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times the entire second expression. But that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial, not a single coefficient. That doesn't make sense, so perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and the second part doesn't affect it. But that seems unlikely because the problem includes both parts. Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it, and the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and the second part is a separate factor that doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. But that doesn't seem right because when you multiply two polynomials, each term from the first polynomial gets multiplied by each term from the second polynomial, so the coefficients do combine. Wait, perhaps I should think of it as the product of two polynomials. So, the first polynomial is \\((a + b)^4\\), and the second is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). When you multiply them, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial. Because each term in the second polynomial, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), contributes a coefficient to the term \\(a^2b^2\\) times some power of \\(c\\). But if we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then we need to sum all the coefficients from the second polynomial. So, the sum of the coefficients in the second polynomial is found by plugging \\(c = 1\\), which gives us \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 * 64 = 384. Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, if the problem was only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, it would be 6, but since it's in the product, we have to consider the entire second part. So, I think the correct answer is 384. Let me just verify this by considering a simpler case. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, expanding, we have \\((a^2 + 2ab + b^2) \\times (c + 1/c)\\). The coefficient of \\(ab\\) in the product would be 2 times the sum of the coefficients in the second part, which is \\(1 + 1 = 2\\), so 2 * 2 = 4. If I multiply it out, the terms would be \\(a^2c\\), \\(a^2 \\times 1/c\\), \\(2ab \\times c\\), \\(2ab \\times 1/c\\), \\(b^2c\\), and \\(b^2 \\times 1/c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(ab\\) is indeed 2c + 2/c, but if we're looking for the coefficient of \\(ab\\), regardless of \\(c\\), it's 2 times the sum of the coefficients in the second part, which is 2*(1 + 1) = 4. So, that seems to check out. Therefore, applying the same logic to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times 64, which is 384. So, I think that's the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{384}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem.\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\):\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\n   \\]\n   So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\n2. **Consider the second part \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   The sum of the coefficients in this polynomial is found by setting \\(c = 1\\):\n   \\[\n   \\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\n   \\]\n\n3. **Combine the results:**\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the sum of the coefficients from the second part:\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 64 = 384\n   \\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{384}\\)."

Let me write that out: \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying that, each term becomes \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m} = \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the exponent on \\(c\\) in each term is \\(6 - 2m\\). I need the term where the exponent is 0 because that's the term that will multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) without affecting the \\(c\\) terms. So, setting \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), we can solve for \\(m\\): \\(6 = 2m\\) implies \\(m = 3\\). So, the coefficient for \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\).

Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120. Wait, let me just make sure I didn't make a mistake.

So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the sum over all \\(k\\) and \\(m\\) such that \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\), which is only when \\(k = 2\\). So, for \\(k = 2\\), the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) times the sum over all \\(m\\) of \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\). Wait, no, because the term is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\dbinom{6}{m}\\) for each \\(m\\), so when you collect all the terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) appears, it's \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) times the sum of all \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\) for \\(m = 0\\) to \\(6\\). But the sum of \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\) from \\(m = 0\\) to \\(6\\) is \\(2^6 = 64\\). So, the coefficient would be \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). Wait, but that seems too straightforward. Let me check that again. Alternatively, maybe I'm supposed to consider that when you multiply the two expansions, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\) times each term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), so the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But the sum of coefficients in a polynomial is found by setting all variables to 1. So, setting \\(c = 1\\), \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). So, yes, the sum of coefficients is 64, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). Hmm, that seems correct. But wait, let me think again. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) is in the first part, and when you multiply by the second part, which is a polynomial in \\(c\\), each term in the second part will multiply \\(a^2b^2\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be \\(6\\) times the sum of all coefficients in the second part. So, yes, 6 times 64 is 384. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think differently. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The expression \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) can be expanded, and when you multiply it by 6, each term will have a coefficient multiplied by 6. But since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), it's just 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. Yeah, that makes sense. So, I think the coefficient is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression is found by first determining the coefficient in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Then, considering the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the sum of its coefficients is \\(2^6 = 64\\). Multiplying these together gives \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\boxed{384}."

Wait, but actually, when you multiply two polynomials together, each term from the first polynomial is multiplied by each term from the second polynomial. So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), then I need to consider all terms in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) that, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), don't change the \\(a^2b^2\\) part. That is, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because \\(c^0 = 1\\), and multiplying by that won't affect the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. So, I need to find the constant term (the term with \\(c^0\\)) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me expand that using the binomial theorem as well. \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). I need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so I set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), I get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Let me compute that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20. Now, since the original expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, that would be 6 multiplied by 20, which is 120. Wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake. So, in the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. In the second part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the constant term is 20. So, when you multiply these two expansions together, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), we just take the product of the coefficients from each part where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2 and the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0. So, yes, 6 times 20 is 120. I think that's correct. Let me just check if there's another way to think about it. Alternatively, maybe I can consider the entire expansion as a product and think about how the terms combine. But since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is to take the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from \\((a + b)^4\\) and the constant term from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\).

But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I need to consider how that term interacts with the terms from the second expression. Wait, actually, no. Because \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term that comes only from \\((a + b)^4\\), and the \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) part will contribute some constants or terms involving \\(c\\), but since we're only interested in \\(a^2b^2\\), perhaps the coefficient is just 6 times the constant term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).

Wait, no, actually, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when you multiply them, each term from the first expansion is multiplied by each term from the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term from the second part. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the sum of all terms from the second part because each term in the second part will multiply with \\(a^2b^2\\) to give a term like \\(a^2b^2 \\times\\) something. But wait, that can't be right because then the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is not what we want. Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, in other words, in the entire product, the coefficient for the term \\(a^2b^2\\) times any combination of \\(c\\) terms. But actually, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, so the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by each term in the second expansion, but the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is the same as saying the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times the constant term from the second expansion. Because if you have \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by, say, \\(c^k\\), that would be a different term, but if you have \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by 1 (the constant term), that's the only time \\(a^2b^2\\) appears as a standalone term. Wait, no, that's not correct. Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, each of those will contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product. But actually, no, because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by \\(c^k\\), you get a term \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), which is different from \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the only way \\(a^2b^2\\) appears without any \\(c\\) terms is if it's multiplied by the constant term in the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the constant term in the second part. So, I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me work that out. Using the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the exponent of \\(c\\) in each term is \\(6 - 2m\\). We want the term where the exponent is 0, i.e., \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(m = 3\\). So, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the second part), which is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Wait, but let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. Because when you multiply two expressions, each term from the first is multiplied by each term from the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part, which includes terms with different powers of \\(c\\). So, in the entire product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, but the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would only occur when the second term is a constant (i.e., when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero). So, yes, that makes sense. Therefore, the coefficient is 6 times 20, which is 120. Alternatively, maybe I should think of it as the product of the two coefficients. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part is 20, so the overall coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120. Yeah, that seems right. Let me just verify with an example. Suppose I expand \\((a + b)^4\\) and get terms up to \\(a^4b^0\\), \\(a^3b^1\\), \\(a^2b^2\\), etc., each with their coefficients. Then, when I multiply by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each of those terms will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, for the term \\(a^2b^2\\), its coefficient in the first part is 6, and when multiplied by each term in the second expansion, it becomes 6 times each term in the second expansion. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would be the term where the second factor is 1 (the constant term), because any other term would introduce a \\(c\\) term, making it not just \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120. Yeah, I think that's correct.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break it down into two parts:\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\):\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} a^{2}b^{2} = 6a^2b^2\n   \\]\n   So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in this part is 6.\n\n2. **Find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n   \\]\n   The constant term occurs when the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0:\n   \\[\n   6 - 2m = 0 \\implies m = 3\n   \\]\n   The constant term is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\n   \\]\n\n3. **Multiply the coefficients:**\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficients from both parts:\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 20 = 120\n   \\]\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}."

So, that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, that would be if we were expanding the entire product, but actually, the question is about the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is in the first part, and when multiplied by the entire second part, each term would have \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by some term in the second expression. But since the second expression is a polynomial in \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in the second expression, because each term in the second expression is a coefficient times some power of \\(c\\), so when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would accumulate all those coefficients. But wait, that doesn't seem right because the second expression is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which when expanded, has terms with positive and negative exponents of \\(c\\). So, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), each of those terms would contribute to different terms in the product, but the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) specifically would be the sum of all the coefficients in the second expression, because each coefficient is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) where \\(k\\) is the exponent from the second expression. But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, that coefficient would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expression. Wait, but the sum of the coefficients in the second expression is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), right? Because substituting \\(c = 1\\) into \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) gives the sum of all the coefficients. So, \\(\\left(1 + 1/1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the sum of the coefficients is 64. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 * 64 = 384. But wait, that seems high. Let me think again. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it because the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and since the second part is multiplied by the first part, the coefficient would be the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all coefficients from the second part, which is indeed 6 * 64 = 384. But let me check that logic again. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). The first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), when expanded, has a term \\(a^2b^2\\) with coefficient 6. The second part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), when expanded, has multiple terms, each with their own coefficients.

So, for example, if you have (A + B)^4 * (C + D)^6, then the coefficient of A^2B^2 is 6, and the coefficient of C^k D^{6 - k} is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}\\). But in our case, the second expansion is in terms of \\(c + 1/c\\), so each term is \\(c^k\\) or \\(c^{-k}\\). But since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), that coefficient would be the product of the coefficients from each expansion. So, the coefficient from the first part is 6, and the coefficient from the second part is the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is when we set \\(c = 1\\), so \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the total coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384. So, I think that's the answer. But let me double-check. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only considering terms where \\(c\\) is raised to the 0 power, meaning \\(c^0 = 1\\). In that case, we would need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is the middle term when the exponent is even. So, for \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the expansion has terms from \\(c^6\\) down to \\(c^{-6}\\). The term where the exponent is 0 is when the number of \\(c\\) terms equals the number of \\(1/c\\) terms. So, in the expansion, that would be when we choose 3 \\(c\\)s and 3 \\(1/c\\)s. The coefficient would be \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Let me compute that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then the coefficient would be 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the second part), giving 120. But the problem didn't specify \\(c^0\\), it just said the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, that's ambiguous. Wait, let me read the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" It doesn't specify any condition on \\(c\\), so it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). That would mean that the coefficient is 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, giving 384. But if it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it's 6 * 20 = 120. Hmm, maybe I should check the problem again. It says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", so I think it's 384 because it's considering all possible powers of \\(c\\). Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me think differently. The entire expression is a product of two polynomials. Each term in the first polynomial is of the form \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}a^{4 - k}b^k\\) and each term in the second polynomial is of the form \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - m}(1/c)^m = \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, when you multiply them, the terms will be \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}\\dbinom{6}{m}a^{4 - k}b^k c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, if we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), that corresponds to \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). So, regardless of \\(m\\), the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) will be the sum over all \\(m\\) of \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\dbinom{6}{m}\\). So, that's 6 times the sum of \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\) for \\(m = 0\\) to \\(6\\). The sum of \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\) from \\(m = 0\\) to \\(6\\) is \\(2^6 = 64\\). So, the total coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384. Therefore, the answer is 384. Wait, but earlier I thought maybe it's 120, but that was under the assumption that \\(c^0\\) was required. But the problem didn't specify that, so I think 384 is correct. Alternatively, perhaps I should think of it as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, so it's just 6 times the entire expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384.

Because when I multiply the two expressions together, each term from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term from the second expansion. But since I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), perhaps the terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) will just be constants in this context? Wait, no, actually, when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second. But in this case, the first polynomial is in terms of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the second is in terms of \\(c\\). So, when you multiply them, the variables are separate. So, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first part will be multiplied by every term in the second part. But the question is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which means I'm only considering the part that comes from the first expansion. The second expansion, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), when expanded, will have terms involving \\(c^6\\), \\(c^4\\), etc., but since they are multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), each term in the second expansion will contribute a factor to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, no, actually, that's not correct. Because \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), so when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the resulting expression will have terms like \\(a^2b^2 \\times c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2 \\times c^4\\), etc., but the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually be the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each of those will have \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by some power of \\(c\\), but the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the sum of all coefficients from the \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) expansion. Wait, that doesn't make sense. Let me think again. When you multiply two expressions, the coefficients of the resulting terms are products of the coefficients from each expression. So, if I have a term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part with coefficient 6, and then I multiply it by each term in the second part, which is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which expands to a sum of terms like \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - k}(1/c)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, each term in the second expansion has a coefficient \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}\\) and a variable part \\(c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, when I multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) (which is a term with coefficient 6) by each term in the second expansion, the resulting terms will be \\(6 \\times \\dbinom{6}{k} a^2b^2 c^{6 - 2k}\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). However, in the product, \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by various powers of \\(c\\). So, does that mean that \\(a^2b^2\\) will have a coefficient that is the sum of all the coefficients from the second expansion? Because each term in the second expansion, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), will contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times some power of \\(c\\). But wait, the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. Hmm, that's a bit confusing. Let me try to clarify. When you have a product of two polynomials, say \\(P(a, b) \\times Q(c)\\), the coefficient of a specific term in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) is the product of the coefficient of that term in \\(P(a, b)\\) and the entire polynomial \\(Q(c)\\). So, in this case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(Q(c)\\), because \\(Q(c)\\) is a polynomial in \\(c\\), and when you multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), each term in \\(Q(c)\\) will contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c\\) raised to some power. But the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, perhaps the question is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that doesn't make sense because the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which would give \\(2^6 = 64\\). So, would the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) be 6 * 64 = 384? That seems too straightforward. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where \\(c\\) cancels out. Because if you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by terms from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the only term that would have \\(c^0\\) is when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. So, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would make sense. So, let me check that. So, in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero is when \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which implies \\(k = 3\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire product would be 6 * 20 = 120. Alternatively, if the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without considering \\(c\\), then it would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384. But that seems unlikely because the problem specifies \\(a^2b^2\\), which suggests that it's considering all possible powers of \\(c\\). Wait, but the problem didn't specify any power of \\(c\\), just \\(a^2b^2\\). So, perhaps it's considering all terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present, regardless of the power of \\(c\\). In that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384. But let me think again. When you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in one polynomial is multiplied by the entire other polynomial. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the entire polynomial \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But since the problem is asking for the coefficient, which is a number, perhaps it's considering the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). The sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is found by substituting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient would be 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it's 6 * 20 = 120. I'm a bit confused. Let me check the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" It doesn't specify any power of \\(c\\), so I think it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. Therefore, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384. But wait, let me think differently. When you have two separate variables, \\(a, b\\) and \\(c\\), the product \\((a + b)^4 (c + 1/c)^6\\) will have terms like \\(a^kb^{4 - k} c^{6 - 2m}\\), where \\(k\\) and \\(m\\) are integers. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would only come from \\(k = 2\\) in the first expansion, which gives \\(a^2b^2\\) with coefficient 6, and then multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would be the sum of all terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any power of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384. So, I think the answer is 384. But to be sure, let me calculate the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). The sum of coefficients is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), so \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it's 6 * 20 = 120. But since the problem doesn't specify \\(c^0\\), I think it's 384. Wait, but let me think again. If the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then yes, it's 384. But if it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), it's 120. Since the problem didn't specify, I'm going to assume it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), so 384. But I'm not entirely sure. Let me check the original problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" It doesn't mention \\(c\\), so perhaps it's considering all terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) appears, regardless of the power of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384. So, I think the answer is 384. Wait, but let me think about how the multiplication works. When you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part. So, each term in the second part is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the sum over all k of \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}\\), because each term \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\\) is multiplied by 6, and then summed over k. But the sum of \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}\\) over k is \\(2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384. So, that's consistent with my earlier thought. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplying it by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), resulting in \\(2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n\\boxed{384}"

Perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, but without considering the \\(c\\) terms. So, in other words, when you multiply the two expressions, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term would be multiplied by every term in the second expression, so the coefficient would indeed be 6 multiplied by the sum of the coefficients in the second expression, which is 64. So, 6 * 64 = 384. But wait, that seems like a lot. Let me think if that's correct. Alternatively, maybe I'm supposed to consider only the constant term in the second expression because any other term would involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), which would affect the exponents. Wait, but the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, in that case, the coefficient would indeed be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expression, which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. Hmm, but I'm not sure. Maybe I should approach it differently. Let me try expanding the second expression, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), using the binomial theorem. So, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\).

Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" Hmm, perhaps I'm supposed to consider that the entire expression is a product, and I need to find the coefficient of the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) appears, regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, that would mean that the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) would contribute a coefficient that, when multiplied by 6, would give the total coefficient for \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for various \\(k\\). But wait, that doesn't seem right either because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would include all possible terms with \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by any power of \\(c\\). But that would make the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) equal to 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me think about that. The sum of the coefficients in a polynomial is found by plugging in 1 for all variables. So, the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) would be when \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 * 64 = 384. But wait, is that correct? Let me check. Alternatively, maybe I'm supposed to consider that the entire expression is a product, and when expanding, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would multiply each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in the second expansion. But that seems to be the case. So, the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is indeed 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which would be the case if we're treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable. So, the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), meaning that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 multiplied by each term in the expansion, so the coefficient would be 6 times each term's coefficient. But that would mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^6\\) is 6, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^4\\) is 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^4\\) in the second expansion, and so on. But the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so perhaps it's considering all possible powers of \\(c\\), meaning that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). When you expand this, each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) and is multiplied by every term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part (which is 6) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Because each term in the second part, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), would contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times that term's coefficient. So, the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is indeed when \\(c = 1\\), which is 64. So, 6 * 64 = 384. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 384. Wait, but let me make sure. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion, but that would make the coefficient a polynomial, which doesn't make sense because the coefficient should be a constant. So, I think the correct approach is that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, giving 384. Therefore, the coefficient is 384.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break down the problem as follows:\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\), so its coefficient is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\n   \\]\n\n2. **Consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   The sum of all coefficients in this expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\):\n   \\[\n   (1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\n   \\]\n\n3. **Multiply the coefficients:**\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the product of the coefficients from each part:\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 64 = 384\n   \\]\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{384}\\)."

    "text": " But wait, the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). That means I don't need to worry about the \\(c\\) terms when it comes to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Because when you multiply two expressions together, each term from the first expression gets multiplied by each term from the second expression. But since I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I can consider that term from the first part and then, for the second part, I can take the entire expansion as a single term because it's multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, no, that's not quite right. Actually, when you multiply two polynomials, each term from the first polynomial is multiplied by each term from the second polynomial. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the entire expansion of the second part. But since the second part doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), it's just a constant factor when considering the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, that doesn't make sense. Let me think again. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), and the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), doesn't affect the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). So, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by every term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and not any specific term involving \\(c\\), I think I might have misread the problem. Wait, no, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, which includes the \\(c\\) terms. So, perhaps I need to consider the entire product and find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. But that doesn't make sense because \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term in the first part, and when multiplied by the second part, it becomes \\(a^2b^2\\) times each term in the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would actually be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the sum of all terms in the second part. Wait, no, that can't be right because each term in the product would be a combination of a term from the first polynomial and a term from the second. So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\), then I would have to sum the coefficients of \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But that seems complicated. Wait, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times some power of \\(c\\), but the problem statement just says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", so perhaps it's considering the entire expression, treating \\(c\\) as another variable. But that would mean that the term \\(a^2b^2\\) could be multiplied by any power of \\(c\\), so the coefficient would actually be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. Wait, that doesn't seem right. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, considering all possible combinations with the \\(c\\) terms. But that would mean that \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term from the second expansion, so the coefficient would be the coefficient from the first part times the entire expansion of the second part. But that would make the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) a polynomial in \\(c\\), which seems unlikely because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me re-read the problem: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, the expression is a product of two binomials, each raised to a power. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), and when you multiply it by the second part, it's multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the entire expansion of the second part. But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. Wait, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some \\(k\\), but it's just written as \\(a^2b^2\\). Hmm, maybe I need to consider that the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term from the second expansion, so the coefficient would be the coefficient from the first part times the sum of the coefficients from the second part. But that would mean the coefficient is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The sum of the coefficients in a polynomial is found by setting all variables to 1. So, \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient would be 6 * 64 = 384. But wait, that seems high. Let me check. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, meaning that it's multiplied by any power of \\(c\\), so the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, giving 384. But I'm not sure if that's the intended interpretation. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), meaning the constant term in the second expansion. Let me see: \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The constant term is when the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out. Using the binomial theorem, the general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). To find the constant term, set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times the constant term in the second expansion, then the coefficient would be 6 * 20 = 120. But I'm not sure which interpretation is correct. Let me think again. The problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", without specifying any \\(c\\) terms. So, perhaps it's considering the entire product and treating \\(c\\) as another variable, so the term \\(a^2b^2\\) can be multiplied by any power of \\(c\\), and the coefficient would be the sum over all possible \\(c\\) terms. But that would mean the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, giving 384. Alternatively, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), meaning that it's multiplied by any power of \\(c\\), then the coefficient would indeed be 384. But that seems a bit odd. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is miswritten and is supposed to ask for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be 120. Let me check both possibilities.\n\nFirst, let's consider the first interpretation: the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, that would mean that \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, so the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion. The sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by substituting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient would be 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times the constant term in the second expansion, then the coefficient would be 6 times the constant term in the second expansion. As I calculated earlier, the constant term is 20, so 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nBut the problem is written as \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", without any mention of \\(c\\), so I think the first interpretation is correct. Therefore, the coefficient is 384.\n\nWait, but let me think again. When you have two polynomials multiplied together, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum of the products of the coefficients of terms whose variables multiply to give that specific term. So, in this case, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial is multiplied by every term in the second polynomial. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial. Because each term in the second polynomial is a multiple of some power of \\(c\\), but when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), it contributes to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, that would mean the coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem had asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), then it would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^k\\) in the second expansion. But since it's just \\(a^2b^2\\), I think the intended answer is 384.\n\nWait, but let me check the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, it's possible that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which would mean that we're treating \\(c\\) as another variable, and the term \\(a^2b^2\\) can be multiplied by any power of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, giving 384.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), which is the constant term, then it's 6 times 20, which is 120.\n\nBut since the problem doesn't specify any \\(c\\) terms, I think the correct interpretation is that it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, meaning that it's multiplied by any power of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient is 384.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because usually, when you're asked for the coefficient of a term in a product, you're considering the term with specific exponents for all variables. So, if the problem is asking for \\(a^2b^2\\), without specifying \\(c\\), it's ambiguous. But in the context of the problem, it's likely that they want the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times the constant term in the second expansion, which would be 120.\n\nWait, let me think about this differently. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When you multiply these two, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second part. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the entire second expansion. But that would mean that the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. Therefore, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, considering all possible \\(c\\) terms, which would mean that the coefficient is a sum over all possible \\(c\\) terms. But that's not standard. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is miswritten and is supposed to ask for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be 120.\n\nWait, let me try to clarify. If the problem had been written as \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), and it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then the answer would be 120. But since it's just asking for \\(a^2b^2\\), perhaps the intended answer is 120, assuming that the \\(c\\) terms cancel out, i.e., the constant term.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is written correctly, and the coefficient is indeed 384, considering all \\(c\\) terms. But I'm not sure. Let me check online for similar problems.\n\nWait, I can't actually look things up, but I can reason it out. If the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, without specifying any \\(c\\) terms, then it's ambiguous. But in most cases, when a problem asks for the coefficient of a term in a product involving multiple variables, it's usually considering the term with specific exponents for all variables. So, if it's asking for \\(a^2b^2\\), it's probably expecting that the \\(c\\) terms are also considered, which would mean that the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, and the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, giving 384.\n\nBut I'm still a bit unsure. Let me think about it another way. Suppose I expand both expressions:\n\nFirst, \\((a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\).\n\nSecond, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = c^6 + 6c^5 \\times \\dfrac{1}{c} + 15c^4 \\times \\dfrac{1}{c^2} + 20c^3 \\times \\dfrac{1}{c^3} + 15c^2 \\times \\dfrac{1}{c^4} + 6c \\times \\dfrac{1}{c^5} + \\dfrac{1}{c^6}\\).\n\nSimplifying the second expansion: \\(c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15\\dfrac{1}{c^2} + 6\\dfrac{1}{c^4} + \\dfrac{1}{c^6}\\).\n\nNow, when I multiply these two expansions together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second part. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion because each term in the second expansion is a coefficient times some power of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 * (sum of coefficients in the second expansion).\n\nThe sum of the coefficients in the second expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nSo, after carefully considering, I think the correct answer is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplying it by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 64. Therefore, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n\\boxed{384}"

But that would mean the coefficient is 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so perhaps it's just 6 multiplied by the entire expansion, but that doesn't give a numerical coefficient.

So, the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is when \\(c = 1\\), which is \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 * 64 = 384. But let me check this because I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, maybe I should consider that the second expansion \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) can be expanded, and each term is a coefficient times \\(c^k\\), but when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), the coefficient would be 6 times each of those coefficients.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient in the expansion without considering \\(c\\), but that seems unlikely. Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me try a different approach. Let's consider the entire expression as \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). When we expand this, each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\), and its coefficient is 6. Then, this term is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. Because each term in the second expansion is a coefficient times a power of \\(c\\), and when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), it just adds to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product.

But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would include all the terms from the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems odd because the coefficient is a polynomial, not a number. Alternatively, maybe the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating \\(c\\) as a variable independent of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), so the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, not a single number. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2 and 2 respectively, and the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0. That would make sense because then the coefficient would be a number. So, maybe I need to find the term where in the product, \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\). That would require finding the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) and then multiplying it by 6. Let me check that approach. So, first, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. Then, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) would be the middle term, which is when the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0. Using the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(1/c\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, we need to find the value of \\(k\\) such that \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), \\(6 - 2k = 0 \\implies k = 3\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product is 6 * 20 = 120. So, that would be the answer. Wait, but earlier I thought it was 384, but that was when I considered the sum of all coefficients, which would be when \\(c = 1\\), giving 64, and then 6 * 64 = 384. But that would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times the entire expansion of \\(c\\) terms, which isn't a single coefficient. So, perhaps the correct approach is to consider the term where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out, i.e., \\(c^0\\), so that the coefficient is a number. Therefore, the correct coefficient is 120. Let me confirm this by another method. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, but that doesn't make sense because \\(c\\) is another variable. So, more accurately, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be a polynomial in \\(c\\), but if we're only interested in the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, then the coefficient would be 120. Therefore, I think the correct answer is 120.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we proceed as follows:\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\), so its coefficient is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\n   \\]\n\n2. **Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n   \\]\n   We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, which occurs when \\(6 - 2k = 0 \\implies k = 3\\).

So, does that mean the \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) part doesn't affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)? Let me think. When you multiply two expressions together, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression. But since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) won't affect the exponents of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because each term in the first part gets multiplied by each term in the second part. But wait, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the same as the coefficient in \\((a + b)^4\\) because when you multiply by the other expression, it's just scaling the entire term by the sum of the other expression. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, no, that doesn't sound right. Let me think again. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. So, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term comes from \\((a + b)^4\\), and when you multiply by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of what happens with \\(c\\), that term would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that can't be right because the coefficient can't depend on \\(c\\). Wait, no, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is a coefficient times a power of \\(c\\), and when you multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), the coefficient becomes 6 times the sum of all coefficients from the second expression. But actually, that's not quite right either. Let me clarify. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when you expand this, each term will be of the form \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}a^{4 - k}b^k \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - m}\\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying the exponents of \\(c\\), that becomes \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}\\dbinom{6}{m}a^{4 - k}b^k c^{6 - 2m}\\). Now, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) occurs when \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients from the \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) part, but that's not correct because the exponents of \\(c\\) vary. Wait, no, actually, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is separate from the \\(c\\) terms. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't make sense because the coefficient can't include variables. Wait, no, actually, when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, times the sum of all the coefficients in the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because each term in the second part is a coefficient times some power of \\(c\\), and when you multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), the coefficient becomes 6 times each of those coefficients. But that would mean the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the sum of the coefficients of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but the sum of the coefficients of a polynomial is found by setting all variables to 1. So, in this case, setting \\(c = 1\\), the sum of the coefficients would be \\(\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times 64, which is 384. But wait, that seems too large. Let me check again. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by all the terms from the second expression. So, the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that would make the coefficient dependent on \\(c\\), which isn't possible because coefficients are constants. Therefore, I must have made a mistake in my reasoning. Let me try another approach. Since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and the rest of the expression involves \\(c\\), perhaps the coefficient is just 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that can't be because the coefficient should be a number, not an expression involving \\(c\\). Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, so effectively, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in the second expression. Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expression, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^k\\) would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^k\\) in the second expression. But since the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), it would be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in the second expression. The sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times 64, which is 384. But wait, that seems high. Let me verify. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some specific \\(k\\), but it's not. It's just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would indeed be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expression, which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, it's just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), irrespective of what happens with \\(c\\). So, in the expansion, each term is of the form (coefficient from first part) * (coefficient from second part) * \\(a^{2}b^{2}c^{k}\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the sum over all \\(k\\) of (coefficient from first part) * (coefficient from second part). But the coefficient from the first part is 6, as we found earlier, and the coefficient from the second part is the entire expansion. Wait, no, that's not correct. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part, but that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because coefficients are constants. Therefore, perhaps the problem is intended to be interpreted differently. Maybe it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, considering all possible terms, but without specifying any particular power of \\(c\\). In that case, the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), but that seems odd. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, so the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would make the coefficient a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because coefficients are constants. Therefore, I must have made a mistake in my initial approach. Let me try a different method. Let's consider that the product \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) can be expanded as the product of two separate expansions. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from \\((a + b)^4\\), specifically the term \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\\). Now, when this is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the product will be of the form \\(6a^2b^2 \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\), where \\(m\\) ranges from 0 to 6. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^{6 - 2m}\\) would be \\(6 \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), without specifying any particular power of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is actually the sum of all the coefficients from the second expression multiplied by 6. Wait, no, that's not correct because each term in the product has a different power of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is not a single number but rather a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense in this context. Therefore, perhaps the problem is intended to ask for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. That would make more sense. So, if that's the case, we need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product. So, let's approach it that way. So, first, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. Now, in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. Let's find that. The general term in the expansion is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - m} \\times \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\). We want the exponent of \\(c\\) to be zero, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which gives \\(m = 3\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expression is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire product is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). So, the coefficient is 120. Wait, that makes sense. So, the problem was asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but without considering the \\(c\\) terms, which is a bit ambiguous. However, given that the problem includes \\(c\\) terms, it's likely that it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. Alternatively, if it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, then it would be 6 times the entire expansion, which is a polynomial, but that doesn't seem right. Therefore, I think the intended interpretation is that we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. Let me double-check. So, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. In \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term where \\(c^0\\) is when \\(m = 3\\), and the coefficient is 20. So, multiplying these together gives 6 * 20 = 120. Yes, that seems correct. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) (assuming \\(c^0\\)) is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is found by considering the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2 in \\((a + b)^4\\) and the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0 in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\n1. Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n2. Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) and find the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0. This occurs when \\(m = 3\\), giving the coefficient \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n3. Multiply the two coefficients: \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

Wait, no, that doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a specific term, \\(a^2b^2\\), which is in the first part.

Wait, but the problem is stated as \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, perhaps it's considering all the terms where the variables \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are squared, regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't make sense because the coefficient should be a numerical value, not a polynomial. Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the question. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" Hmm, perhaps it's considering \\(a^2b^2\\) as a term, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that seems odd because the coefficient should be a number, not a polynomial. Alternatively, maybe the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when considering the product, but since \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) are separate variables, perhaps the coefficient is just 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that would mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion. Let me think. The sum of the coefficients in a polynomial is found by setting all variables to 1. So, the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) would be \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, if that's the case, then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 * 64 = 384. But wait, that seems high. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would just be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, that would mean the coefficient is 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that would make the coefficient a polynomial, which doesn't make sense because the coefficient should be a scalar. Hmm, perhaps I need to clarify the problem. Alternatively, maybe the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), so the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. That would make sense because then you're looking for the term where \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are squared and \\(c\\) is to the power of zero. So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). That seems plausible. Let me check that approach. So, first, find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, as I found earlier. Then, find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because when you multiply, you want the exponents of \\(c\\) to cancel out, so \\(c^k \\times c^{-k} = c^0\\). So, let me compute that. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, we need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be zero, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which implies \\(m = 3\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Let me calculate that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire product is 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient is 120. Wait, that seems more reasonable. Let me double-check. So, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. In \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. So, when you multiply these two, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by the constant term (c^0) from the second part, giving \\(6 * 20 a^2b^2 = 120a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient is 120. That makes sense. Alternatively, if the problem had been to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some specific \\(k\\), that would be different, but since it's just \\(a^2b^2\\), perhaps it's considering the term where \\(c\\) cancels out, i.e., \\(c^0\\).

But since I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), perhaps the terms involving \\(c\\) will just be coefficients themselves, and since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), maybe the coefficient will be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, no, that doesn't sound right. Let me think again. Actually, when you multiply two polynomials, each term from the first polynomial gets multiplied by each term from the second. But since the second polynomial is in terms of \\(c\\), and the first is in terms of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), the variables are different, so the only way \\(a^2b^2\\) can appear in the product is by taking the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part and multiplying it by the constant term (if any) from the second part. Wait, but \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) doesn't have a constant term unless the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out. Let me check that. So, the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) can be done using the binomial theorem as well. So, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). Now, for this term to be a constant (i.e., \\(c^0\\)), the exponent of \\(c\\) must be zero. So, 6 - 2m = 0. Solving for m, we get 2m = 6, so m = 3. So, the constant term is when m=3, which is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} c^{0} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20. Therefore, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part will be multiplied by 20 from the second part. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the second part). So, 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient should be 120. Wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake here. Let me go through it again. So, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Then, in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the constant term is when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, which happens when m=3, so the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, when you multiply the two expressions, each term from the first is multiplied by each term from the second. But since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), we only need the constant term from the second expression because any other term involving \\(c\\) would result in a term that includes \\(c\\) raised to some power, which we don't want. So, the only contribution to \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from multiplying \\(a^2b^2\\) by the constant term 20. Therefore, 6 * 20 = 120. Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe I should think of it as the product of the coefficients because the variables are separate. So, the coefficient from the first part is 6, and from the second part, the constant term is 20, so their product is 120. Yeah, that makes sense.

    "text": " But wait, the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so I don't need to worry about the \\(c\\) terms when it comes to the \\(a^2b^2\\) term, right? Because when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But since I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), that term in the first expansion is 6a\u00b2b\u00b2, and when I multiply it by the entire second expansion, each term in the second expansion will be multiplied by 6a\u00b2b\u00b2. But since the question is just about the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), the part involving \\(c\\) doesn't affect the \\(a^2b^2\\) term because it's just a separate variable. Wait, is that correct? Let me think again. Wait, no, actually, when you multiply two expressions, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part would be multiplied by each term in the second part, which includes terms with \\(c^6\\), \\(c^4\\), etc., but since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, the coefficient would just be the product of the coefficients from each part. Wait, but that doesn't make sense because the \\(c\\) terms are separate. Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me rephrase. The problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression. So, when I expand \\((a + b)^4\\), I get terms like 6a\u00b2b\u00b2, and when I expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), I get terms involving various powers of \\(c\\). But when I multiply these two expansions together, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second. However, the problem is only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). Wait, no, that can't be right because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would actually include all possible terms from the second expansion multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). But wait, no, that's not correct. The problem is probably asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by any power of \\(c\\), so the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients from the second expansion, because each term in the second expansion would multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. But that doesn't make sense because the second expansion is a separate part. Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, the expression is a product of two expansions. When you multiply them, the terms are combinations of terms from each expansion. So, to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), you just take the coefficient from the first expansion, which is 6, and multiply it by the entire second expansion. But that would give you 6 times the second expansion, which is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), regardless of \\(c\\). Wait, that can't be right because the entire expression is a product, so the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would have coefficients multiplied by various powers of \\(c\\). But the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so perhaps it's considering the entire expression as a polynomial in \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\), and it's asking for the coefficient of the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present, regardless of the power of \\(c\\). Wait, no, that doesn't make sense because each term would be a product of a term from the first expansion and a term from the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by each term from the second expansion, each of which has a different power of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually be the coefficient from the first expansion (which is 6) multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients from the second expansion. But that doesn't seem right because the second expansion is a separate part. Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think differently. The problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product. So, when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will come from the product of the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first expansion and each term in the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion multiplied by the entire second expansion. But that can't be right because that would give a polynomial in \\(c\\), but the problem is just asking for a single coefficient. Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Perhaps it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, considering all possible terms, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, the coefficient would be 6 times the entire second expansion. But that doesn't make sense because the coefficient is a numerical value, not a polynomial. Wait, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me try to break it down again. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When expanded, each term will be of the form \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}a^{4 - k}b^k \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - m}\\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying the second part, \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the general term is \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}\\dbinom{6}{m}a^{4 - k}b^k c^{6 - 2m}\\). Now, we are interested in the term where \\(a^2b^2\\), so we need \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). So, \\(k = 2\\), which gives us the coefficient from the first part as \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Now, for the second part, the exponent of \\(c\\) is \\(6 - 2m\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), we need to sum over all possible \\(m\\) values, because each \\(m\\) will give a different power of \\(c\\), but all multiplied by the same \\(a^2b^2\\) term. Wait, no, that can't be right because each term in the product will have a specific power of \\(c\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, each with a different power of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient from the first part (6) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion. Because each term in the second expansion is a coefficient times a power of \\(c\\), and when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), it becomes \\(a^2b^2\\) times that coefficient times \\(c^{6 - 2m}\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), so we need to sum all the coefficients from the second expansion and multiply by 6. Wait, but that would mean the coefficient is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion. But the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\). So, \\(\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 * 64 = 384. Wait, but that seems high. Let me check that again. Alternatively, perhaps I'm supposed to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some specific \\(k\\), but the problem doesn't specify. It just says the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, considering all possible terms, so it's just 6 times the entire second expansion, but that can't be right because the coefficient should be a number, not a polynomial. Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me think again. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When you expand this, each term is a product of a term from the first expansion and a term from the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first expansion, which is 6a\u00b2b\u00b2, and it's multiplied by each term from the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients from the second expansion. Because each term in the second expansion is a coefficient times some power of \\(c\\), and when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), it becomes \\(a^2b^2\\) times that coefficient times \\(c^k\\). But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), the coefficient would be the sum of all the coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by 6. So, the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient would be 6 * 64 = 384. But wait, that seems too straightforward. Let me check if that's correct. Alternatively, maybe I'm supposed to consider that the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is only multiplied by the constant term in the second expansion, but that doesn't make sense because the second expansion has multiple terms. Wait, no, because when you multiply, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be present in the product with coefficients from each term in the second expansion. So, the total coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient from the first expansion (6) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion. Which is 6 * 64 = 384. So, that must be the answer. Wait, but let me confirm by actually expanding the second part. The second expansion is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem, this is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). The coefficients are all \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\), so the sum of the coefficients is when \\(c = 1\\), which is 2^6 = 64, as I thought. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 * 64 = 384. So, I think that's the answer.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Then, the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is calculated by setting \\(c = 1\\), resulting in \\(2^6 = 64\\). Multiplying these together gives \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\boxed{384}."

Hmm, that might make sense. Let me check that. If I have \\((a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6. Then, when I multiply this by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second.

So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that's not correct because the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) are not being summed; instead, each term is multiplied by \\(6a^2b^2\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but actually, no. Let me think again. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is a coefficient times a power of \\(c\\), and when you multiply by \\(6a^2b^2\\), you get \\(6a^2b^2\\) times each of those terms.

Wait, but the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\). So, substituting \\(c = 1\\), we get \\((1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion is 64. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times 64, which is 384. Wait, but that seems high. Let me verify this.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, which includes all possible terms, including those with different powers of \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would indeed be 6 multiplied by the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, giving 384. But let me check this again.

So, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, resulting in terms like \\(6a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(6a^2b^2c^4\\), etc. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in the second expansion, because each term in the second expansion is a coefficient times a power of \\(c\\), and when you multiply by \\(6a^2b^2\\), you get \\(6a^2b^2\\) times each of those coefficients, each attached to a different power of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\) would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion. Since the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\), then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me confirm this by considering a simpler case. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^1 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, \\((a + b)(c + 1/c) = ac + a/c + bc + b/c\\). The coefficient of \\(a\\) would be c + 1/c, but if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a\\) regardless of \\(c\\), it's the sum of coefficients in the second expansion, which is 1 + 1 = 2. So, the coefficient of \\(a\\) would be 2, and similarly for \\(b\\). So, in that case, the coefficient of \\(a\\) is 2, which is 1 (from the first expansion) times 2 (sum of coefficients in the second expansion). So, applying that logic, in our original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times 64, which is 384.\n\nWait, but another way to think about it is that when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum of the products of the coefficients of terms whose exponents add up to the desired term. But in this case, since we're looking for \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), we can treat the two parts separately. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6, and the second part is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which when expanded, has a sum of coefficients equal to 64. Therefore, when you multiply, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it, and the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, regardless of the other terms. But that seems unlikely because the problem includes the second part, so it's probably expecting the coefficient considering both parts. So, I think the correct approach is to calculate 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me check the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). The sum of coefficients is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), so \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\), as I thought earlier. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Is the problem asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, which would include all possible powers of \\(c\\), or just the coefficient when considering \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) alone? The problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 (c + 1/c)^6\\)\", so it's in the entire product. So, that would include all terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present, regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, giving 384.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should think of it as the product of two independent expansions, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the product of the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) and the sum of the coefficients from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, that would be 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but another way to approach this is to recognize that in the product \\((a + b)^4 (c + 1/c)^6\\), the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are independent of those involving \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it, and the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and since the other part doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), it just gets multiplied by 1, so the coefficient remains 6. But that seems contradictory because the problem includes both parts, so it's more likely that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion.\n\nWait, to clarify, let me think about how the multiplication works. Each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, which has coefficients like 1, 6, 15, 20, 15, 6, 1 for \\(c^6, c^4, c^2, c^0, c^{-2}, c^{-4}, c^{-6}\\) respectively. So, when you multiply \\(6a^2b^2\\) by each of these terms, you get \\(6a^2b^2c^6 + 36a^2b^2c^4 + 90a^2b^2c^2 + 120a^2b^2 + 90a^2b^2c^{-2} + 36a^2b^2c^{-4} + 6a^2b^2c^{-6}\\). So, in the entire product, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^6\\) is 6, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^4\\) is 36, and so on. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). Wait, but in this context, when they say \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", they might mean the coefficient when considering all possible powers of \\(c\\). But that doesn't make much sense because \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term on its own, and the presence of \\(c\\) would make it a different term. So, perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when considering the entire product, which would include all possible powers of \\(c\\). But that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384, as I thought earlier.\n\nWait, but another perspective: the problem might be asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) irrespective of the power of \\(c\\). So, in other words, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for any integer \\(k\\). But that's not standard. Typically, when asked for the coefficient of a term like \\(a^2b^2\\), it's implied without any variables, but in this case, since the entire expression includes \\(c\\), it's ambiguous. However, given the structure of the problem, it's more likely that they want the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), which would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, resulting in 384.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to be interpreted as finding the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, which would include all possible powers of \\(c\\), so the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me check with a smaller exponent to see if this makes sense. Suppose we have \\((a + b)^1 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). The expansion would be \\(a c + a/c + b c + b/c\\). The coefficient of \\(a\\) is \\(c + 1/c\\), which is 2 when \\(c = 1\\). Similarly, the coefficient of \\(b\\) is also 2. So, in this case, the coefficient of \\(a\\) is 2, which is 1 (from the first expansion) times 2 (sum of coefficients in the second expansion). So, applying this logic, in our original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times 64, which is 384.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out. In that case, the coefficient would be different. Let me explore that possibility.\n\nIf the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then we need to find the term where the exponents of \\(c\\) sum to zero. So, in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term with \\(c^0\\) is the middle term, which is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}c^3 \\times (1/c)^3 = 20c^0 = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire product would be 6 (from \\((a + b)^4\\)) times 20 (from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\)), which is 120.\n\nBut the problem didn't specify \\(c^0\\), so I'm not sure if that's what it's asking. The problem just says the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a bit ambiguous because \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\). So, in the product, each term would be something like \\(a^k b^m c^n\\), so \\(a^2b^2\\) would imply \\(n = 0\\), meaning \\(c^0\\). Therefore, the problem is likely asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nWait, but that contradicts my earlier conclusion. So, perhaps I need to clarify the problem's intent. If the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), then it's 6 times the sum of coefficients in the second expansion, which is 384. If it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it's 6 times 20, which is 120.\n\nBut let me look back at the problem statement: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 (c + 1/c)^6\\)?\" Since the problem includes both \\(a, b\\) and \\(c\\), but the term \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), it's ambiguous. However, in algebra, when you have multiple variables, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would refer to the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2, and the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, because otherwise, the term would be \\(a^2b^2c^k\\). So, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be 120.\n\nWait, but in the earlier example with \\((a + b)(c + 1/c)\\), the coefficient of \\(a\\) is \\(c + 1/c\\), which is 2 when \\(c = 1\\), but if you're looking for the coefficient of \\(a\\) irrespective of \\(c\\), it's not clear. So, perhaps in our problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the sum of coefficients in the second expansion, which is 384. Alternatively, if we're looking for \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), it's 120.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is intended to be interpreted as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which would include all terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present, regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to have the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which is 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part, so the coefficient would be 6 times each coefficient in the second expansion, but that doesn't make sense because then you'd have multiple coefficients. So, perhaps the correct interpretation is that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 384.\n\nWait, but let me think again. If I have two polynomials, P(a, b) and Q(c), then the product P(a, b) * Q(c) would have terms where each term of P is multiplied by each term of Q. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in P(a, b) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in Q(c), because each term in Q(c) is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). So, in this case, P(a, b) is \\((a + b)^4\\), and Q(c) is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). The sum of coefficients in Q(c) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\(2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but another way to see this is that when you multiply by Q(c), each term in P(a, b) is scaled by the entire expansion of Q(c). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in P(a, b) is 6, and when you multiply by Q(c), you're effectively scaling that 6 by each coefficient in Q(c). But when you collect like terms, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\) would be the sum of all these scaled terms, which is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in Q(c), which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it, and the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, regardless of the other terms. But that seems unlikely because the problem includes the second part, so it's more likely that the coefficient is 384.\n\nWait, but let me check again with a concrete example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^1 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, the expansion is \\(ac + a/c + bc + b/c\\). The coefficient of \\(a\\) is \\(c + 1/c\\), and the coefficient of \\(b\\) is \\(c + 1/c\\). So, if I set \\(c = 1\\), the coefficient of \\(a\\) is 2, which is the same as the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion. So, in that case, the coefficient of \\(a\\) is 1 (from the first expansion) times 2 (sum of coefficients in the second expansion) = 2. Similarly, for \\(b\\), it's 1 * 2 = 2. So, applying that logic, in our problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nTherefore, I think the correct answer is 384.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it might be 120 if we're considering \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). Let me see why that might be the case. If the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then we need to find the term where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out, i.e., \\(c^0\\). In the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term with \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) would be 6 * 20 = 120. But the problem didn't specify \\(c^0\\), so I'm not sure. It depends on the interpretation.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is intended to be interpreted as finding the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which would include all possible powers of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. Therefore, the answer is 384.\n\nBut to make sure, let me think of another approach. Let's consider that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which would be the product of the coefficients of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and the sum of the coefficients in the second part. Since the first part's coefficient is 6 and the sum of coefficients in the second part is 64, the product is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nTherefore, I think the correct answer is 384.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{384}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem and properties of polynomial multiplication.\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\), so the coefficient is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\n   \\]\n\n2. **Consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   The sum of the coefficients in this expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\):\n   \\[\n   \\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\n   \\]\n\n3. **Combine the results:**\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is the product of the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) and the sum of the coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 64 = 384\n   \\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{384}\\)."

    "text": " But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, I think that means I don't need to consider the terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) because they are separate variables from \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). Wait, but actually, when you multiply two expressions together, each term from the first expression gets multiplied by each term from the second expression. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), perhaps the terms from the second expression can be considered as a constant multiplier for that specific term. Hmm, let me think again. Alternatively, maybe the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), will contribute a coefficient that we need to consider when looking at the overall coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). But wait, \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\) at all, so the coefficient would just be the product of the coefficients from each part. Wait, no, that might not be correct. Let me clarify: when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficients of the terms multiply. So, if I have a term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part with coefficient 6, and then when I multiply by the entire second part, which is a polynomial in \\(c\\), each term in that second polynomial will multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. But since the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), that would mean that the coefficient is actually 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't make sense because the problem is likely expecting a numerical coefficient. Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me read the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, maybe the \\(c\\) terms are just part of the expression, but since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just 6, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. But that seems too straightforward. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the entire product, and the coefficient is 6 times the sum of the coefficients of all terms in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, no, that would be if we were looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times the sum of all coefficients in the other part, but that's not the case here. I think I'm confusing myself. Let me try another approach. Let's consider the entire expression as a product of two separate expansions: one in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the other in \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). When you multiply them together, each term from the first expansion is multiplied by each term from the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion will be multiplied by every term in the second expansion. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term without \\(c\\), the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. Wait, no, that's not right either. Because each term in the second expansion has a coefficient, but when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term, the resulting terms will have coefficients that are products of 6 and the coefficients from the second expansion. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), maybe the coefficient is just 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. But wait, the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), so \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 * 64 = 384. But I'm not sure if that's correct. Let me check again. Alternatively, perhaps the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), doesn't affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) because \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\). So, when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, each term will have a different power of \\(c\\), but since we're only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), perhaps the coefficient is just 6, because the \\(c\\) terms are separate. Wait, but that doesn't seem right either. Maybe I should think of the entire expression as a product, and the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion, because \\(c^0\\) would be the term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), allowing \\(a^2b^2\\) to stand alone. So, in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is the middle term when expanded, which occurs when the exponents of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) balance out. Let me calculate that. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is given by the binomial theorem: \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We want the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which implies \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\), which is 20. So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the second part), giving 120. Wait, that seems more plausible. Let me confirm. So, in the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. In the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. When you multiply these two parts together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by the term \\(c^0\\) (which is 1) from the second part, giving \\(a^2b^2 \\times 1\\), with a coefficient of 6 * 20 = 120. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120. Let me just make sure I didn't make any mistakes in the calculations. So, \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) is indeed 6, and \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\) is 20. Multiplying them gives 120.

    "text": " But wait, the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Does that mean I can ignore the part with \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\)? Wait, no, because when I multiply two expressions together, each term from the first expression gets multiplied by each term from the second. But since I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), maybe I don't need to consider the \\(c\\) terms. Let me think about that. So, when I expand \\((a + b)^4\\), I get terms like \\(a^4\\), \\(4a^3b\\), \\(6a^2b^2\\), \\(4ab^3\\), and \\(b^4\\). Similarly, when I expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), I'll get terms involving different powers of \\(c\\). But when I multiply these two expansions together, the only way to get a term with \\(a^2b^2\\) is to take the \\(6a^2b^2\\) term from the first expansion and multiply it by some term from the second expansion. But since the second expansion has \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), any term I take from there will have some power of \\(c\\), either positive or negative. However, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term without \\(c\\). Wait, that can't be right because \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term in the first part, and when multiplied by a term from the second part, it would have some power of \\(c\\). So, perhaps the question is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms? Or maybe it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by any term from the second expansion. But that doesn't make much sense because the problem is written as a single expression. Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me re-read the problem: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, in the entire expansion, I'm looking for the coefficient of the term \\(a^2b^2\\), which would come from the product of the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first part and the constant term (i.e., the term with \\(c^0\\)) in the second part. Because if I take \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part and multiply it by, say, \\(c^k\\) from the second part, then the term would be \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), which isn't just \\(a^2b^2\\). So, to get a term that's exactly \\(a^2b^2\\), I need to multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by the constant term in the second expansion, which is the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. So, I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me figure that out. Again, using the binomial theorem, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). I need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be zero, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), \\(2m = 6\\) so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\), which is \\(\\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20. Now, going back to the original product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from multiplying the \\(6a^2b^2\\) term from the first expansion by the \\(20\\) term from the second expansion. So, the coefficient would be \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Wait, but let me make sure I'm not missing anything. Is there another way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) from the product? For example, could I get \\(a^2b^2\\) by taking some other terms from the first expansion and some from the second? Let me think. If I take a term with \\(a^3b\\) from the first expansion, say \\(4a^3b\\), and multiply it by a term with \\(c^{-1}\\) from the second expansion, then the product would be \\(4a^3b c^{-1}\\), which isn't \\(a^2b^2\\). Similarly, taking \\(a^4\\) and multiplying by \\(c^{-2}\\) would give \\(a^4c^{-2}\\), which doesn't help. On the other hand, taking \\(ab^3\\) and multiplying by \\(c^2\\) would give \\(ab^3c^2\\), which still isn't \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) is by taking the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first expansion and the constant term from the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient is indeed \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Wait, but let me double-check my calculations. The binomial coefficient for \\((a + b)^4\\) at \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). The binomial coefficient for \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) at the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, multiplying them together gives 6 * 20 = 120. That seems correct.

    "text": " But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I think that term doesn't involve \\(c\\), so maybe I can treat the second part separately. Wait, but no, actually, when you multiply two expressions together, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second. But since the problem is only asking about the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), perhaps the coefficient from the first part is all that matters, and the second part just contributes a factor that might not affect the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. Wait, that doesn't seem right. Let me think again. Wait, no, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when you multiply them, each term from \\((a + b)^4\\) gets multiplied by each term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), that means we're looking for the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero because only then will the \\(a^2b^2\\) term not be multiplied by any \\(c\\) terms. So, perhaps I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) and then multiply that by the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) from \\((a + b)^4\\). Let me check that. So, first, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, as I found earlier. Now, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). How do I do that? Well, again, using the binomial theorem. Let me write out the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). It would be \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying that, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m} = \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the exponent of \\(c\\) in each term is \\(6 - 2m\\). I need the exponent to be zero, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Now, since the original expression is the product of \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), when we multiply them, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by the constant term (with respect to \\(c\\)) from the second part, which is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Wait, but let me make sure I'm not missing anything. So, the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is in the first part, and since the second part is multiplied by it, and we're only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), the only way that term can come about is if we take the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part and the \\(c^0\\) term from the second part. So, yes, that should be correct. Therefore, the coefficient is 120. I think that's the answer. Let me just double-check my calculations. So, \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\) and \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying them gives 120. Yep, that seems right.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Next, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying these gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\boxed{120}"

So, does that mean I can treat \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) as a constant when looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)? Wait, no, that doesn't make sense. Because when you multiply two expressions, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second. But since we're only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), that means we need to consider how the terms in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) contribute to the overall product without affecting the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. Wait, but actually, when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by every term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But the question is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would mean that the \\(c\\) terms are irrelevant because we're not considering any \\(c\\) terms in the final product. Wait, that can't be right. Let me think again. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product. So, that would include all the terms from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) multiplied by the corresponding terms from \\((a + b)^4\\). But since we're only interested in the terms where \\(a\\) is squared and \\(b\\) is squared, the other variables \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) can be anything, but their coefficients will contribute to the overall coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, I think that the coefficient would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that doesn't seem right because each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) has its own coefficient, and when you multiply, each term from \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term from the other expansion. So, to get the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), we need to take the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiply it by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) will be multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), contributing to the overall coefficient. Alternatively, maybe I should consider that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is just 6 times the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), so that would be \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, the coefficient would be 6 times 64, which is 384. But I'm not sure if that's correct. Let me check another way. Alternatively, since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, maybe the coefficient is just 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is indeed 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. But wait, let me think again. Is that accurate? Because when you have a product of two expressions, the coefficient of a specific term in one part is multiplied by the entire other expression. So, yes, if you have \\((a + b)^4\\) times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, giving 384. But let me make sure I'm not missing anything. Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the product of the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in \\((a + b)^4\\) and any term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is indeed 64. So, 6 * 64 = 384. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 384. Wait, but let me check this another way. Let me expand both parts separately. The expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is \\(a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) can be written using the binomial theorem as \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, each term in this expansion has a coefficient of \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}\\) and a power of \\(c\\) equal to \\(6 - 2k\\). Now, when we multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) from \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by every term in the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be \\(6\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. The sum of all coefficients in the second expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(6 * 64 = 384\\). So, that seems consistent. Alternatively, if I didn't consider the sum of coefficients, I might have thought that the coefficient is just 6, but that would be incorrect because each term in the second expansion contributes to the overall product. So, the correct approach is to take the coefficient from the first part and multiply it by the sum of coefficients from the second part. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 384. Wait, but let me make sure. Suppose I have two expressions, \\(P(a, b)\\) and \\(Q(c)\\). Then, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(P(a, b) * Q(c)\\) is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(P(a, b)\\) multiplied by the sum of coefficients in \\(Q(c)\\), because each term in \\(Q(c)\\) is multiplied by every term in \\(P(a, b)\\). So, yes, that makes sense. Therefore, I think 384 is the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\(2^6 = 64\\). Multiplying these together gives \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{384}."

But since I'm only interested in \\(a^2b^2\\), which comes from \\((a + b)^4\\), I can just consider the coefficient of that term and then, if needed, see how it interacts with the other part. Wait, no, actually, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me think again. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when you expand this product, each term from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term from the second expansion.

Wait, no, that doesn't make sense. Because when you multiply, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second. But since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term without \\(c\\), it would have to be multiplied by a term in the second expansion that is \\(c^0\\), because \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) have exponents. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I need to find both coefficients. First, as I found earlier, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. Now, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me expand that using the binomial theorem as well. So, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying that, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\times c^{-m} = \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be 0, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Now, putting it all together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the two coefficients we found: 6 (from \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\)) multiplied by 20 (from \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)). So, 6 \u00d7 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120. Wait, but let me double-check to make sure I didn't make a mistake. So, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). In \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0 is when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), so \\(m = 3\\), and the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).

When you multiply two expressions together, the coefficients multiply as well. So, if I'm looking for the term that has \\(a^2b^2\\), then that term would come from the product of the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in \\((a + b)^4\\) and the constant term (with respect to \\(a\\) and \\(b\\)) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).

Wait, no, that's not quite right.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When you multiply these two expressions together, each term from the first expansion is multiplied by each term from the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part would be multiplied by each term from the second part. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, the coefficient would be the coefficient from \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients from the second part. Wait, but that's not correct either because each term in the second part is a different power of \\(c\\), so when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each of those terms, you get terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), etc., but the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that doesn't make sense because the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is a polynomial in \\(c\\), and when you multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), it becomes a polynomial in \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, so that would mean that the coefficient is the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all the coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, that seems plausible. Let me test that idea. The sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) would be obtained by setting \\(c = 1\\), because then each term becomes just its coefficient. So, substituting \\(c = 1\\), we get \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of all coefficients in the second part is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 64, giving 384. Wait, but that seems high. Let me check that again. Alternatively, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which would mean that the coefficient is indeed 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients from the second part, which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. But I'm not entirely sure if that's the correct approach. Let me consider another way. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, and since the \\(c\\) terms are separate, the coefficient would just be the product of the coefficients from each part. But wait, no, because the \\(c\\) terms don't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't make sense because the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is a sum of terms, each with different powers of \\(c\\). So, when you multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), each term becomes \\(a^2b^2\\) times a term in \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would actually be the same as the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients from the second part, because each term in the second part contributes to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the sum of the coefficients in the second part is indeed 64, so the total coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, maybe I should think of it as the product of the two expansions, and the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by every term in the second expansion, so the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. But wait, let me check this with a smaller example to see if this approach is correct. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^1 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, the expansion would be \\((a + b)(c + 1/c)\\). The coefficient of \\(a^1b^0\\) would be 1 times the sum of coefficients in the second part, which is \\(1 + 1 = 2\\), so the coefficient of \\(a\\) would be 2. But if I expand it, it's \\(ac + a/c + bc + b/c\\). The coefficient of \\(a\\) is indeed 2, because it's \\(ac + a/c\\), so the coefficient is 2. Similarly, the coefficient of \\(b\\) would be 2 as well. So, this approach seems to work in this small case. Therefore, perhaps in the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6 * 64 = 384. Wait, but let me make sure. Alternatively, maybe I should consider that the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), so the coefficient would be 6 times each coefficient in the second expansion, but that would mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^k\\) in the second expansion. But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), perhaps the answer is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, maybe the problem is expecting the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, so the answer is 6 * 64 = 384. Hmm, that seems plausible. Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it, and the answer is simply 6, but that doesn't seem right because the entire expression is multiplied by the other expansion, so the coefficients would scale accordingly. Let me think again. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, if I expand this, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Since the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is obtained by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\(2^6 = 64\\). So, the coefficient would be 6 * 64 = 384. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 384. I think that's the correct approach. So, the answer should be 384.\n\nWait, but let me confirm this with another approach. Alternatively, perhaps I can treat the entire expression as a product of two polynomials and find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) by considering only the terms that contribute to \\(a^2b^2\\), which would only come from the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), because the second part doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\). Therefore, the coefficient would be the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part, which is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, the coefficient is indeed 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. So, I think that's correct.\n\nWait, but perhaps I made a mistake in considering that the entire expansion is multiplied. Let me think again. When you have two polynomials multiplied together, the coefficient of a specific term in one polynomial is multiplied by all terms in the other polynomial. So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, it would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Since the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 64, as calculated by setting \\(c = 1\\), then the coefficient would be 6 * 64 = 384. So, I think that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should compute the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) and then find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when multiplied by \\((a + b)^4\\). But that seems unnecessary because the second expansion doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), so each term in the second expansion is just a coefficient that scales the terms in the first expansion. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me check if the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is indeed 64. If I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(1 + 1/1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\), which is correct. So, that part is correct.\n\nTherefore, putting it all together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me think again. If I have \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), then each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part, which are terms like \\(c^6\\), \\(c^4\\), etc. So, in the product, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^6\\) would be 6 * 1 (since the coefficient of \\(c^6\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 1), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^4\\) would be 6 * 15 (since the coefficient of \\(c^4\\) is 15), and so on. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would be the sum of all coefficients of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for all \\(k\\), which is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384. So, that's correct.\n\nWait, but another way to think about it is that when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a term in one polynomial is multiplied by all terms in the other polynomial. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial times the entire second polynomial. But since we're only interested in the coefficient, regardless of the other variables, we can consider the coefficient as 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 64, giving 384.\n\nSo, after considering all these angles, I think the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is 384.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{384}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem.\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\):\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\n   \\]\n   So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\n2. **Consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   The sum of the coefficients in this expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\):\n   \\[\n   \\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\n   \\]\n\n3. **Combine the results:**\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the product of the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) and the sum of the coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 64 = 384\n   \\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is \\(\\boxed{384}\\)."
