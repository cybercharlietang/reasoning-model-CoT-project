    "text": " The same goes for \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nSo, maybe I should handle each part separately and then combine them. Let me start with \\((a + b)^4\\). Using the binomial theorem, which states that \\((x + y)^n = \\sum_{k=0}^{n} \\dbinom{n}{k} x^{n - k} y^{k}\\), I can expand this. \n\nFor \\((a + b)^4\\), the expansion will be \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k} b^{k}\\). I need the term where \\(a^2b^2\\), so that would be when \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). So, the coefficient there is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Let me calculate that: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6.\n\nNow, moving on to the second part: \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Again, using the binomial theorem, this expands to \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying that, each term becomes \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m} = \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\).\n\nBut wait, in the original problem, we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Hmm, but the second part is in terms of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), which are different variables. So, unless \\(c\\) is related to \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), I think the two parts are independent. That is, when we multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion gets multiplied by each term in the second expansion.\n\nBut the problem is asking specifically for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Since the second part doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), when we multiply, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part will be multiplied by every term from the second part. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression will be the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients from the second part.\n\nWait, is that right? Let me think again. So, \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) can be thought of as the product of two independent expansions. So, when you multiply them, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be \\(6\\) (from the first part) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part.\n\nBut what's the sum of all coefficients in the second part? The sum of coefficients in a polynomial is found by plugging in 1 for all variables. So, in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), if we set \\(c = 1\\), we get \\((1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of coefficients is 64.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). Hmm, that seems straightforward, but let me double-check to make sure I didn't miss anything.\n\nWait, another way to think about it: when you have two polynomials multiplied together, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each polynomial. But in this case, the specific term \\(a^2b^2\\) is only in the first polynomial, and the second polynomial doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial multiplied by the entire second polynomial. But since we're only interested in the coefficient, and not the variable part, it's equivalent to multiplying by the sum of the coefficients of the second polynomial, which is 64.\n\nAlternatively, if I were to write out the product, it's \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k} b^{k} \\times \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, when you multiply these, each term in the first sum is multiplied by each term in the second sum. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\(k=2\\) in the first sum, which is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} a^2b^2\\), and it's multiplied by every term in the second sum. So, the coefficient becomes \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} \\times \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m}\\). \n\nCalculating that sum: \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} = 2^6 = 64\\), as I thought earlier. So, the total coefficient is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). \n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. Sometimes, when multiplying polynomials, the variables can interfere, but in this case, the variables \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), so they don't affect each other. So, when you multiply, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term is just carried through, multiplied by all the terms in the second polynomial, but since we're only looking for the coefficient, it's just the product of the coefficients.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem had asked for a term that involved \\(c\\) as well, like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), then we would have to find the specific coefficient in the second polynomial for \\(c^k\\) and multiply by 6. But since it's just \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, the coefficient is 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 64. So, 6*64 is indeed 384.\n\nLet me just confirm this with another approach. Let's compute the entire expansion, but that might be too time-consuming. Alternatively, think about the degrees. The first part has terms up to \\(a^4b^0\\) and \\(a^0b^4\\), and the second part has terms from \\(c^6\\) down to \\(c^{-6}\\). When multiplying, the variables \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are independent, so the term \\(a^2b^2\\) can be paired with any term from the second polynomial, but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, the coefficient is just 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 64. So, 6*64 is 384.\n\nWait, another thought: if I were to write the entire product, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 multiplied by each term in the second expansion, but since we're just collecting like terms for \\(a^2b^2\\), which are independent of \\(c\\), it's 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial. So yes, that's 6*64=384.\n\nI think that makes sense. So, the coefficient is 384.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{384}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem for both parts separately and then combine the results.\n\n1. **Expanding \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k} b^{k}\n   \\]\n   The term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\), so the coefficient is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\n   \\]\n\n2. **Expanding \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n   \\]\n   The sum of all coefficients in this expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\):\n   \\[\n   (1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\n   \\]\n\n3. **Combining the results:**\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the product of the coefficient from the first part and the sum of the coefficients from the second part:\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 64 = 384\n   \\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{384}\\)."

So, maybe I just need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and then, since the second part doesn't affect \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), the coefficient remains the same.

I need the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2. That would be when \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). So, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\nNow, looking at the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), I think this expansion will involve terms with different powers of \\(c\\), but since the problem is only asking about \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), maybe the coefficient remains 6 regardless of the second part. Wait, no, that doesn't make sense because the entire expression is the product of the two expansions. So, I might need to consider how the terms multiply.\n\nWait, actually, no. Because \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are in the first part, and \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) are in the second part, when you multiply the two expansions together, the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms are independent of the \\(c\\) terms. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would just be the same as the coefficient in the first part, because when you multiply by the second expansion, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But since we're only interested in \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in the second expansion that result in \\(c^0\\), because only those terms would multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term without introducing any \\(c\\) terms.\n\nWait, that seems more accurate. So, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because that's the only term that won't affect the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. So, let me find that.\n\nUsing the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\).\n\nWe want the exponent of \\(c\\) to be 0, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\).\n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion is 20. Therefore, when we multiply the two expansions together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the product of the coefficient from the first part (6) and the coefficient from the second part (20). So, 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake here. So, the first part gives 6 for \\(a^2b^2\\), and the second part, when expanded, has a term with \\(c^0\\) which is 20. So, when we multiply these two parts together, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part is multiplied by the 20 from the second part, so the overall coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should think of it as the entire expression being the product of the two expansions, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\) would be 6 * 20 = 120. But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, perhaps I need to consider that when multiplying, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term is multiplied by all the terms in the second expansion, but only the \\(c^0\\) term contributes to the \\(a^2b^2\\) coefficient without any \\(c\\) terms. Therefore, the coefficient is indeed 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but let me think again. If I have \\((a + b)^4\\) times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), and I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), then in the product, \\(a^2b^2\\) can be multiplied by any term from the second expansion, but only the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero will contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the overall expression. Because if you have \\(a^2b^2 \\times c^k\\), that would be a term \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), but the problem is only asking for \\(a^2b^2\\), so we're only interested in the terms where \\(k = 0\\). Therefore, the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but is that correct? Because in the product, every term from the first expansion is multiplied by every term from the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, but only the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero will result in a term that's just \\(a^2b^2\\). The other terms would have additional factors of \\(c^k\\), which we're not interested in. So, yes, the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of it as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6, and since the second part contributes a factor of 20 when \\(c^0\\) is considered, the overall coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120. So, I think that's correct.\n\nWait, but let me check if I've made a mistake in calculating the binomial coefficients. For the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). For the second part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\), because when m = 3, we have \\(c^{6 - 6} = c^0\\). So, that's correct.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 * 20 = 120. So, I think that's the answer.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me try expanding a bit more carefully. So, \\((a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6.\n\nThen, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15/c^2 + 6/c^4 + 1/c^6\\). So, the constant term is 20, which is the coefficient of \\(c^0\\). Therefore, when we multiply the two expansions, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, but only the 20 will contribute to the \\(a^2b^2\\) term without any \\(c\\) terms. So, the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but is that correct? Because when you multiply the two polynomials, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term is only multiplied by the constant term (20) in the second expansion to give \\(a^2b^2\\). All other terms would result in terms with \\(c\\) exponents, which we're not interested in. So, the coefficient is indeed 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of the entire expression as the product of two polynomials, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the product of the coefficients of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second polynomial, which is exactly what I did. So, 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nI think that's correct. So, the coefficient is 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break down the problem into two parts using the binomial theorem.\n\n1. **Expanding \\((a + b)^4\\):**\n   Using the binomial theorem, the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is:\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k} b^k\n   \\]\n   We need the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2.

Because if I have a term with \\(c^k\\) multiplied by a term with \\(c^{-k}\\), they would multiply to \\(c^0 = 1\\), which is a constant. So, maybe I do need to consider the second expansion after all, because the \\(c\\) terms can affect the overall term.\n\nWait, no, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is just \\(a^2b^2\\) times whatever comes from the second expansion that doesn't involve \\(c\\). But the second expansion only has terms with positive and negative powers of \\(c\\). So, unless I have a term in the second expansion that is a constant (i.e., \\(c^0\\)), multiplying it by \\(a^2b^2\\) will give me a term that includes \\(a^2b^2\\) times that constant. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because when you multiply the two expansions, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part can be multiplied by any term from the second part, but only the constant term (i.e., the term with \\(c^0\\)) will result in a term that is just \\(a^2b^2\\) times a constant. All other terms from the second expansion would introduce \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), which would change the term to something like \\(a^2b^2c\\) or \\(a^2b^2/c\\), which are not what we're looking for.\n\nSo, to clarify, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is equal to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Therefore, I need to compute both coefficients separately and then multiply them together to get the final answer.\n\nLet me start with the first part: finding the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\). I remember that the binomial theorem states that \\((a + b)^n = \\sum_{k=0}^{n} \\dbinom{n}{k} a^{n - k}b^k\\). In this case, \\(n = 4\\), and I want the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2, which means \\(a^2b^2\\). So, I need to find the value of \\(k\\) such that \\(n - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). Solving \\(n - k = 2\\) gives \\(k = 2\\), which is consistent. Therefore, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\).\n\nCalculating \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\), which is \\(\\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\nNow, moving on to the second part: finding the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Again, I can use the binomial theorem here. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying each term, we get \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m} = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\).\n\nWe're looking for the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so we set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\).\n\nCalculating \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\), which is \\(\\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). Wait, hold on, that doesn't seem right. Let me recalculate that. \\(6! = 720\\), and \\(3! = 6\\), so \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). Hmm, that's correct. So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20.\n\nNow, to find the overall coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), I need to multiply the two coefficients I found: 6 and 20. So, 6 multiplied by 20 is 120.\n\nWait a second, let me double-check to make sure I didn't make a mistake. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part is 20. Multiplying them together gives 6 * 20 = 120. That seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of the entire expression as a product of two separate expansions, and when you multiply them, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. However, only the constant term in the second expansion will result in a term that is just \\(a^2b^2\\) times a constant. All other terms would introduce a power of \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), which would change the term. Therefore, the only contribution to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the constant term in the second expansion, which we found to be 20. So, multiplying 6 by 20 gives 120.\n\nJust to be thorough, let me consider the entire expansion. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\), and the constant term from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 20. So, when you multiply these together, you get \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\) times \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient is indeed 120.\n\nI think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we need to consider the contributions from both parts of the product.\n\n1. **Finding the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\):**\n   Using the binomial theorem, the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is given by:\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\).

I'm not sure if I need to consider this part because the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, but since the entire expression is multiplied together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But the problem doesn't specify anything about \\(c\\), so maybe I just need the coefficient from the first part, and the second part doesn't affect it because \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\). \n\nWait, no, that doesn't make sense. If I have \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), then when I expand it, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) will be multiplied by terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). However, the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\). So, does that mean that the coefficient is just 6, regardless of the second part? Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by any term from the second expansion, it will still be part of a larger term that includes \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), but the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) itself would be 6 times the entire second expansion. Wait, no, that's not right because the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term in the product. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but since the problem is asking for the coefficient in the entire product, I think I need to consider that. \n\nWait, no, that's not correct. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but in the entire expression, each term will be of the form \\(a^kb^l c^m\\) or \\(a^kb^l c^{-m}\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by all possible terms from the second expansion, which are of the form \\(c^6\\), \\(c^4\\), \\(c^2\\), \\(c^0\\), \\(c^{-2}\\), \\(c^{-4}\\), \\(c^{-6}\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 times the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion. But wait, the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion is when \\(c = 1\\), so \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nWait, but that doesn't seem right because the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a specific term, not multiplied by any \\(c\\) terms. So, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think again. The expression is \\((a + b)^4\\) times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). When you expand this, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, which has various powers of \\(c\\). But since the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), because each term in the second expansion is a coefficient multiplied by some power of \\(c\\), and when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), it becomes a term like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2c^{-k}\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nWait, but that seems too large. Let me check again. Alternatively, maybe I should consider that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is only 6, because the other part doesn't affect it. But that can't be right because the entire expression is a product, so each term is multiplied by terms from both expansions. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, so the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the entire second expansion, but since it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), it's just 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nWait, but let me think differently. Maybe I should compute the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) separately and then multiply them, but since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are different variables, the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are independent of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient from the first expansion times the entire second expansion. But that would mean the coefficient is 6 * \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would then be 6 * \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but that doesn't make sense because coefficients are numbers, not expressions in \\(c\\). \n\nWait, I think I'm getting confused. Let me try to clarify. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). When you expand this, each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, which are of the form \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\times (1/c)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient from the first part (which is 6) multiplied by each term from the second expansion. But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a specific term, regardless of the power of \\(c\\), I think the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. \n\nWait, but the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion is when \\(c = 1\\), so \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just 6, because the other part doesn't affect it. But that can't be right because the entire expression is a product, so each term is multiplied by terms from both expansions. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nWait, but let me think again. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term in the product. So, each term in the product will be of the form \\(a^kb^l c^m\\) or \\(a^kb^l c^{-m}\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by all possible terms from the second expansion, which are \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nWait, but that seems too straightforward. Let me check with a smaller exponent to see if this approach works. Suppose instead of \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), let's take \\((a + b)^1 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^1\\). Then, the expansion is \\((a + b)(c + 1/c) = ac + a/c + bc + b/c\\). The coefficient of \\(a\\) is \\(c + 1/c\\), but since we're only interested in the coefficient, perhaps we should evaluate it when \\(c = 1\\), which would give 2. So, the coefficient of \\(a\\) would be 2. Similarly, in the original problem, if I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = 64\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nYes, that makes sense. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. Therefore, the final answer is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), whose sum of coefficients is 64 when \\(c = 1\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n\\boxed{384}"

Let me think.\n\nActually, the entire expression is a product of two binomials raised to powers. So, to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I need to consider how the terms from each expansion multiply together. But hold on, \\(a^2b^2\\) only involves \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the second part of the product involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). Since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\), and \\(1/c\\) are different variables, their exponents don't interfere with each other, right? So maybe I can treat the two parts separately and then multiply the coefficients?\n\nLet me break it down. First, I'll find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\). Then, I'll consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) and see how it affects the coefficient. Wait, but the problem only asks for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so maybe the second part doesn't affect it? Hmm, no, that doesn't make sense because the entire expression is a product. So, perhaps I need to consider all possible ways that \\(a^2b^2\\) can be multiplied by terms from the second expansion, but since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), the coefficient will just be the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all coefficients from the second part? Wait, that might not be right either.\n\nWait, no. Let me think again. When you multiply two expressions together, each term in the first expression is multiplied by each term in the second expression. So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which comes from the first part, I need to multiply it by the entire expansion of the second part. But since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), the coefficient will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, the terms involving \\(c\\) will just contribute their coefficients, and since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a scalar, it gets multiplied by each coefficient.\n\nBut wait, is that correct? Let me check. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^4 \\binom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\\). The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is when \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\), so that's \\(\\binom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n\nNow, the second part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me expand that. Using the binomial theorem, it's \\(\\sum_{m=0}^6 \\binom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^6 \\binom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\).\n\nSo, each term in the second expansion is \\(\\binom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\) for \\(m = 0\\) to \\(6\\). Now, when I multiply the two expansions together, each term \\(a^{4 - k}b^k\\) from the first part is multiplied by each term \\(\\binom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\) from the second part. But since we're only interested in terms where the variables are \\(a^2b^2\\), which don't involve \\(c\\), we need to find all terms in the product where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero because \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't have any \\(c\\) term.\n\nWait, so actually, I think I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion because when we multiply, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, and only the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero will contribute to \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part.\n\nSo, first, coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is \\(\\binom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n\nNext, coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). To find this, we set the exponent equal to zero: \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), so \\(6 = 2m\\), which means \\(m = 3\\). So, the coefficient is \\(\\binom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nWait, let me verify that. So, the first part gives 6, and the second part gives 20 when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. So, multiplying them gives 120. That seems correct. Alternatively, if I thought that the second part's entire expansion contributes to the coefficient, that would be adding all coefficients from the second expansion, which is \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\), but that would be if I was considering all terms, but since we only want the term where \\(c\\) cancels out, it's just 20. So, I think 120 is correct.\n\nWait, another way to think about it: when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, to get the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), we need to sum over all the coefficients from the second expansion because each term in the second expansion is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). But that can't be, because then the coefficient would be 6 * 64 = 384, which is different from what I thought earlier. Wait, so now I'm confused.\n\nWait, no, that's not right. Because \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term in the first expansion, and when you multiply it by each term in the second expansion, each term in the second expansion is a monomial in \\(c\\). So, when you write the entire product, \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each of the terms in the second expansion, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), etc. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term without any \\(c\\). So, the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) is if we multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by the term in the second expansion that has \\(c^0\\), which is the constant term. So, the coefficient is indeed 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, so the initial thought was correct. So, I think 120 is the right answer. Let me just recap:\n\n1. Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) and find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is \\(\\binom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n\n2.

    "text": " Similarly, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) can also be expanded using the binomial theorem. \n\nWait, but the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, I think I should focus on the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) first because that's where the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms come from. \n\nLet me recall the binomial theorem: \\((x + y)^n = \\sum_{k=0}^{n} \\binom{n}{k} x^{n - k} y^k\\). So, applying this to \\((a + b)^4\\), each term will be \\(\\binom{4}{k} a^{4 - k} b^k\\) for \\(k = 0\\) to \\(4\\). \n\nI need the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2, which means \\(a^2b^2\\). So, let's find the value of \\(k\\) that gives \\(b^2\\). Since the exponent of \\(b\\) is \\(k\\), setting \\(k = 2\\) gives \\(b^2\\), and then the exponent of \\(a\\) will be \\(4 - 2 = 2\\). \n\nSo, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is \\(\\binom{4}{2}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\binom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). \n\nOkay, so the coefficient from the first part is 6. Now, the problem is the product of two expressions: \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when we multiply these two, each term in the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. \n\nBut wait, the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) don't appear in the second expression \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), their coefficients won't be affected by the second expansion. That is, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product will just be the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire second expansion, but since we're only interested in the coefficient, not the variables, maybe I'm overcomplicating it.\n\nWait, actually, no. Let me think again. When you multiply two expressions, each term from the first is multiplied by each term from the second. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the sum of all the terms in the second part. But since the second part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial in \\(c\\), and we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term without \\(c\\), that would mean we're looking for the constant term in the second expansion. Because only then, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), it would result in a term that's just \\(a^2b^2\\) times a constant, hence the coefficient would be 6 times that constant term.\n\nWait, that makes sense. So, first, I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, as I found earlier. Then, I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because when I multiply 6 by that constant term, I'll get the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product. \n\nSo, let me work on finding the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Again, using the binomial theorem: \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\binom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\binom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\).\n\nWe need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, i.e., \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\): \\(6 = 2m\\) => \\(m = 3\\). So, the constant term is \\(\\binom{6}{3}\\).\n\nCalculating that: \\(\\binom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). Wait, that can't be right because 6! is 720, but 3! is 6, so 720/(6*6) is 720/36 = 20. Yeah, that's correct.\n\nSo, the constant term is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the second part), which is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, let me double-check that. So, the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) gives \\(a^2b^2\\) with coefficient 6, and the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) has a constant term 20. So when you multiply these two, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nHmm, that seems right. Alternatively, I can think of the entire product as the product of two independent expansions, so the coefficients multiply when the variables don't interfere. Since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), their coefficients just get multiplied by the constants from the other expansion. So, yeah, 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nI think that's the answer. Let me just recap to make sure I didn't miss anything. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product of two binomials. Since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are only in the first part, their coefficient is determined by the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6. The second part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), contributes a constant term, which is 20, so the overall coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in calculating the binomial coefficients. For \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed \\(\\binom{4}{2} = 6\\). For \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term where the exponent is zero is when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), so \\(m = 3\\), and the coefficient is \\(\\binom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, yes, 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nI think that's correct. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break down the problem into two parts using the binomial theorem.\n\n1. **Expanding \\((a + b)^4\\):**\n   Using the binomial theorem, the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is given by:\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\binom{4}{k} a^{4 - k} b^k\n   \\]\n   We need the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2, which is \\(a^2b^2\\). This corresponds to \\(k = 2\\), so the coefficient is:\n   \\[\n   \\binom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\n   \\]\n\n2. **Expanding \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   Using the binomial theorem, the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is given by:\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\binom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\binom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n   \\]\n   We need the constant term, which occurs when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. Solving \\(6 - 2m = 0\\) gives \\(m = 3\\). The coefficient is:\n   \\[\n   \\binom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\n   \\]\n\n3. **Combining the results:**\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the product of the coefficients from the two expansions:\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 20 = 120\n   \\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}."

    "text": " The binomial theorem says that \\((a + b)^n = \\sum_{k=0}^{n} \\dbinom{n}{k} a^{n - k}b^{k}\\). So, maybe I can apply that here.\n\nAlright, let's start with the first part: \\((a + b)^4\\). I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in this part. Using the binomial theorem, the general term is \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^{k}\\). I want the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2. So, that would be when \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). Let me check: if \\(k = 2\\), then the term is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} a^{2}b^{2}\\). The coefficient here is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\), which is 6. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\nNow, the second part of the expression is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I'm a bit confused about how this relates to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, which is \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) are separate variables from \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), does that mean that when we multiply the two expressions, the terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) don't affect the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\)?\n\nLet me think again. So, if I have \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by something else, say \\(X\\), then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire \\(X\\). Because \\(X\\) is just a constant with respect to \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). Wait, no, actually, \\(X\\) could have terms that are multiplied by other terms, but in this case, \\(X\\) is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\). So, when I expand the entire expression, the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) will be multiplied by terms involving \\(c\\). But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), maybe I just need to consider the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and then multiply it by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that doesn't make sense because the coefficient is a single number, not a polynomial.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some \\(k\\), but it just says \\(a^2b^2\\). Hmm. Let me check the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, it's only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). That means I can treat \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) as a constant when considering the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). But that doesn't seem right because the entire expression is a product, so the coefficients would actually be multiplied.\n\nWait, perhaps I should think of the entire expression as a product of two polynomials. So, when I expand \\((a + b)^4\\), I get terms like \\(a^4\\), \\(4a^3b\\), \\(6a^2b^2\\), \\(4ab^3\\), and \\(b^4\\). Then, when I expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), I get terms involving \\(c^6\\), \\(6c^5\\), \\(15c^4\\), \\(20c^3\\), \\(15c^2\\), \\(6c\\), and \\(1\\). So, when I multiply these two expansions together, each term in the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, in the product, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), that would mean that the coefficient is \\(6\\) times the sum of all the coefficients in the second expansion.\n\nWait, but that can't be right because the second expansion has a finite number of terms, and their coefficients add up to a certain value. Let me calculate the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). To find the sum of the coefficients, I can set \\(c = 1\\). So, substituting \\(c = 1\\), we get \\((1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\nWait, but that seems too straightforward. Let me double-check. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion has a coefficient of 6, and the second expansion, when evaluated at \\(c = 1\\), gives 64, which is the sum of all its coefficients. So, when you multiply the two, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would indeed be 6 times 64, which is 384.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should think of it as each term in the product contributing separately. So, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times each power of \\(c\\) would be 6 times the corresponding coefficient from the second expansion. But since the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), that would mean we're summing over all the coefficients from the second expansion, which is 64, and then multiplying by 6, giving 384.\n\nWait, but maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me try another approach. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). If I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), then I can consider the part of the product where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2 each, and the exponents of \\(c\\) can be anything. So, the coefficient would be the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Since the second part is a polynomial in \\(c\\), the sum of its coefficients is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives 64, as I did before. So, 6 times 64 is 384.\n\nWait, but let me confirm this with a different method. Suppose I expand both expressions fully. The first expansion gives terms up to \\(a^4\\) and \\(b^4\\), and the second expansion gives terms from \\(c^6\\) down to \\(c^{-6}\\). When I multiply them together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will come from the product of \\(6a^2b^2\\) in the first part and each term in the second part. So, each term in the second part will have a coefficient, say, \\(k\\), and the term will be \\(k \\times c^n\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^n\\) will be \\(6k\\). But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of \\(c^n\\), that would mean we're summing over all possible \\(n\\), which is the same as summing over all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64. So, 6 times 64 is indeed 384.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of it as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6, and the entire second part is a separate polynomial, so when you multiply, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the sum of the coefficients of the second polynomial, which is 64. So, 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. Sometimes, when you have multiple variables, you have to consider cross terms, but in this case, since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are in one part and \\(c\\) is in another, they don't interfere with each other's exponents. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would just be the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Because when you multiply, each term in the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part, so the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) times each \\(c\\) term would be 6 times each coefficient in the second part. But since we're just interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), we have to add up all those contributions, which is 6 times the sum of coefficients in the second part.\n\nSo, to recap: The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\(2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\nI think that makes sense. Let me just check if there's another way to approach this. Maybe using generating functions or something else, but I think the method I used is correct. So, I'm pretty confident that the coefficient is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 64. Multiplying these gives \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n\\boxed{384}"

The binomial coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\), which is \\(\\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\\). So, the term is \\(6a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient from the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), is 6.\n\nNow, moving on to the second part of the expression, which is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).

So, in the product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will multiply each term from the second expansion. But the second expansion is in terms of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), so the variables are different. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression will just be the coefficient from the first part, multiplied by the entire second expansion, because the variables are separate. But wait, no, that doesn't make sense. Wait, actually, when you multiply two polynomials, each term from the first polynomial multiplies each term from the second. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), then that term's coefficient will be the coefficient from the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), times the entire expansion of the second part, because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by any term from the second expansion, it just adds a factor involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), but the coefficient part is multiplied by all of them.\n\nWait, no, that can't be right. Because if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the powers of \\(c\\), then actually, the coefficient is the coefficient from the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), times the entire sum of coefficients from the second part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But wait, that's not correct either because each term in the second expansion has a coefficient and a variable part. So, when I multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, the coefficient for each term in the product will be the product of the coefficients from each part.\n\nBut wait, the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), without any restriction on the powers of \\(c\\). So, actually, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by every term in the second expansion, each contributing a different power of \\(c\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) part, we just need to find the sum of all the coefficients from the second expansion, because each term in the second expansion has a coefficient, and when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), it contributes that coefficient to the overall coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product.\n\nWait, no, that's not correct. Because the second expansion is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which when expanded, will have terms like \\(c^6\\), \\(6c^4\\), \\(15c^2\\), \\(20\\), \\(15c^{-2}\\), \\(6c^{-4}\\), \\(c^{-6}\\). Each of these terms has a coefficient. So, when we multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each of these terms, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^6\\) is 6*1=6, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^4\\) is 6*6=36, and so on. But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), we need to sum all these contributions. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in the second expansion.\n\nBut wait, the sum of all the coefficients in the second expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\). So, \\(\\left(1 + 1/1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me double-check that. Alternatively, I can think of it as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part is the middle term, which is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, when we multiply the two, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) times the constant term (c^0) would be 6*20=120. But that's only if we're looking for the term where the power of c is zero. But the problem doesn't specify any condition on c, so we have to consider all possible powers of c. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6*64=384.\n\nWait, but I'm confused now because I thought initially that the coefficient would just be 6 times the middle term, but that's only if we're considering the constant term. But the problem doesn't specify any condition on c, so we have to include all possible powers of c. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6*64=384.\n\nWait, but let me think again. When you have the product of two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in one polynomial is multiplied by all the terms in the other polynomial. So, in this case, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first polynomial will be multiplied by each term in the second polynomial, each of which has a coefficient. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be the coefficient from the first part (6) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part.\n\nThe sum of all coefficients in the second part is indeed when we set \\(c = 1\\), so \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, 6*64=384.\n\nAlternatively, if we didn't consider the sum of all coefficients, but instead thought that the variables are separate, then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the entire second expansion, but that doesn't make sense because the coefficient should be a scalar, not a polynomial. Therefore, the correct approach is to multiply the coefficient from the first part by the sum of the coefficients from the second part, which gives us 384.\n\nWait, but let me check with another approach. Let's expand both parts separately and then see.\n\nFirst, \\((a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6.\n\nNow, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) can be expanded using the binomial theorem as well. The general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(1/c\\right)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). The coefficients are \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}\\) for \\(k\\) from 0 to 6.\n\nSo, the expansion is:\n\n- \\(k=0\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{0}c^6 = 1c^6\\)\n- \\(k=1\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{1}c^4 = 6c^4\\)\n- \\(k=2\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{2}c^2 = 15c^2\\)\n- \\(k=3\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}c^0 = 20\\)\n- \\(k=4\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{4}c^{-2} = 15c^{-2}\\)\n- \\(k=5\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{5}c^{-4} = 6c^{-4}\\)\n- \\(k=6\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{6}c^{-6} = 1c^{-6}\\)\n\nNow, when we multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) (which has coefficient 6) will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^6\\) is 6*1=6, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^4\\) is 6*6=36, and so on. But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), we need to sum all these contributions.\n\nSo, the total coefficient is 6*(1 + 6 + 15 + 20 + 15 + 6 + 1) = 6*(64) = 384.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. The sum inside the parentheses is the sum of the coefficients of the second expansion, which is indeed 64, as calculated before. So, 6*64=384.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem had specified a particular power of \\(c\\), say \\(c^0\\), then we would only take the middle term, which is 20, and multiply by 6 to get 120. But since it's not specified, we have to consider all possible powers, hence summing all coefficients.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\(2^6 = 64\\). Multiplying these together, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n\\boxed{384}"

    "text": " The same goes for \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, the question is specifically asking about the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). That means I might not need to expand the entire expression, just focus on the parts that contribute to \\(a^2b^2\\).\n\nAlright, let me start by looking at the first part: \\((a + b)^4\\). I remember the binomial theorem states that \\((a + b)^n = \\sum_{k=0}^{n} \\dbinom{n}{k} a^{n - k}b^k\\). So, for \\((a + b)^4\\), each term will be \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\\) where \\(k\\) ranges from 0 to 4. Since I'm looking for \\(a^2b^2\\), I need the term where \\(a\\) is squared and \\(b\\) is squared. That means \\(4 - k = 2\\) for \\(a\\), so \\(k = 2\\). Therefore, the coefficient here is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\).\n\nLet me compute that: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. \n\nNow, the expression also has another part: \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I need to consider this part as well, but wait, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\), right? So, does that mean the entire coefficient from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) gets multiplied by the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\)?\n\nWait, maybe I should think of it differently. The entire expression is the product of two expansions: \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when I multiply these two expansions together, each term in the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But since I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), I should find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) because \\(c^0 = 1\\), and that's the only term that won't affect the \\(a^2b^2\\) term.\n\nSo, let me apply the binomial theorem to \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). I need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be 0, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), I get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\).\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). Wait, no, that's not right. Let me correct that. 6! is 720, but 3! is 6, so \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{720}{(6)(6)} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). Hmm, actually, that's correct because \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\) is indeed 20.\n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion is 20. Now, since the original expression is the product of the two expansions, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) will be the product of the coefficients from each part. That is, 6 (from \\((a + b)^4\\)) multiplied by 20 (from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)).\n\nCalculating that: 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120.\n\nWait, let me just make sure I didn't miss anything. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the first part, and since the second part contributes a constant term (in terms of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\)), it's just multiplying the coefficients together. So, yes, 6 * 20 = 120. I think that's correct.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Multiplying these gives 6 * 20 = 120.\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\boxed{120}."

    "text": " The binomial theorem says that \\((a + b)^n = \\sum_{k=0}^{n} \\dbinom{n}{k} a^{n - k} b^{k}\\). So, maybe I can apply that here.\n\nAlright, looking at \\((a + b)^4\\), I want to find the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2 because the problem is asking for \\(a^2b^2\\). So, I can set \\(n = 4\\) and find the term where \\(k = 2\\), because \\(b\\) will have the exponent \\(k\\), and \\(a\\) will have the exponent \\(4 - k\\).

So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. Okay, that's straightforward.\n\nNow, the other part of the expression is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I need to consider this part as well. But wait, the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so maybe the \\(c\\) terms won't affect that? Hmm, let me think. Since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would just be the product of the coefficients from each part, right? Because when you multiply two expressions, the coefficients multiply for the terms where the variables match.\n\nWait, but actually, I need to be careful here. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when you expand both parts, each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) don't appear in the second part, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression will just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, that doesn't seem right because when you multiply, each term from the first expansion is multiplied by each term from the second expansion. But since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would just be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), right? Because each term in the first expansion is multiplied by every term in the second, but since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second part.\n\nWait, but actually, no. Because in the entire expression, each term from \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, for the term \\(a^2b^2\\), it will be multiplied by every term in the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, that doesn't sound quite right because the sum of the coefficients in the second expression is when \\(c = 1\\). Let me check that.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will have a coefficient that is the product of the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) and the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't make sense because the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is a polynomial in \\(c\\), and \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term without \\(c\\). So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because each term in the second expansion is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), effectively making the coefficient 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second part.\n\nWait, but let me think again. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a term in one polynomial is multiplied by the sum of the coefficients of all terms in the other polynomial. So, yes, that makes sense.\n\nSo, first, I found that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. Now, I need to find the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The sum of the coefficients in a polynomial is found by setting all variables to 1. So, if I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = (2)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 64.\n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 64 (sum of coefficients from the second part), which is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. Is the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) really 64? Let's check that by expanding it a bit. Alternatively, maybe I can compute it using the binomial theorem.\n\nThe expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\).\n\nNow, the coefficients are \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}\\) for each term. So, the sum of the coefficients is when \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} = 2^6 = 64\\). Yes, that's correct. So, the sum of the coefficients is indeed 64.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\nWait, but hold on a second. Let me think if that's the correct approach. Because in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term without \\(c\\), that term would be \\(6a^2b^2\\) from the first part multiplied by the sum of all terms in the second part, but only the constant term (the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero) would contribute to \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms. Wait, that's a different approach. So, perhaps I was wrong earlier. Maybe the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), not the sum of all coefficients.\n\nOh, I think I made a mistake earlier. Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, only the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero will result in a term that is just \\(a^2b^2\\) times a constant. All other terms would have \\(c\\) raised to some power, so the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would only have a coefficient from the constant term in the second expansion.\n\nSo, that changes things. So, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is the constant term, and then multiply that by 6.\n\nOkay, let's find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial expansion, the general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\).\n\nWe want the exponent of \\(c\\) to be zero, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\).\n\nSo, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\), which is \\(\\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nWait, that makes more sense. Because if I had multiplied by the sum of all coefficients (64), that would include terms with \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), which would not be part of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, I was wrong earlier; I should only multiply by the constant term in the second expansion.\n\nSo, to recap:\n\n1. In \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6.\n2. In \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the constant term (coefficient of \\(c^0\\)) is 20.\n3. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nYes, that seems correct. Let me double-check my steps.\n\nFirst, the binomial expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) gives the term \\(a^2b^2\\) as \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\\). So, that's correct.\n\nNext, for \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the expansion is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^6 \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\times c^{-k}\\) which simplifies to \\(\\sum_{k=0}^6 \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). Setting \\(6 - 2k = 0\\) gives \\(k = 3\\), and the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20.\n\nTherefore, when multiplying the two expressions, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by the constant term 20 from the second part, giving \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nI think that's the correct answer. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem.\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k} b^{k}\n   \\]\n   The term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\):\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} a^2 b^2 = 6a^2b^2\n   \\]\n   So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\n2. **Find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   Using the binomial theorem:\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n   \\]\n   We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero:\n   \\[\n   6 - 2k = 0 \\implies k = 3\n   \\]\n   The coefficient is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\n   \\]\n\n3. **Combine the results:**\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) and the constant term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 20 = 120\n   \\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

    "text": " The same goes for \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), right? So maybe I can handle each part separately and then combine them.\n\nStarting with \\((a + b)^4\\). Using the binomial theorem, the expansion will be the sum from \\(k = 0\\) to \\(4\\) of \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^{k}\\). So each term is \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^{k}\\). I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which means I need the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2. So, \\(4 - k = 2\\) implies \\(k = 2\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\\). So the coefficient from the first part is 6.\n\nNow, moving on to the second part: \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).

So each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). \n\nWait, but in the original problem, we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Now, this second part is in terms of \\(c\\), so it doesn't directly affect the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). So, does that mean that the entire \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) part is being multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\)? So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), it's just the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), right?\n\nWait, no, that doesn't make sense. Because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, actually, the \\(c\\) terms are separate, so when I multiply the two expansions together, each term from \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since the problem is only asking about the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), I think I just need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and then multiply it by the entire sum of the second part, because the second part doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) exponents.\n\nWait, but that can't be right because the problem is asking for the coefficient in the product. So maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again.\n\nWait, no, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so when I expand the entire expression, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) only come from the first part, and the exponents of \\(c\\) come from the second part. So, when looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of what power of \\(c\\) it's multiplied by, I can just take the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) for \\(a^2b^2\\), which is 6, and then multiply it by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all terms in the second expansion, which is 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that can't be right because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, not an expression.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the question. It says, \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)\". So, perhaps it's considering all terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present, each multiplied by some power of \\(c\\), and then we need the sum of all those coefficients. But that seems complicated. Alternatively, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nWait, let's check that. The sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) would be when \\(c = 1\\), so substituting \\(c = 1\\), we get \\((1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, if I take the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, and multiply it by 64, I get 384. But that seems too straightforward, and I'm not sure if that's what the problem is asking for.\n\nWait, let me think again. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. So, when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by every term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial in \\(c\\), not a numerical coefficient. But the problem is asking for the coefficient, so maybe I'm misunderstanding.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where the exponents of \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are 2, 2, and 0 respectively. That would make more sense because otherwise, the coefficient would involve \\(c\\) terms. Let me check the original problem again: it says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\". It doesn't specify \\(c\\), so maybe it's considering all possible powers of \\(c\\), and the coefficient is just 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 64, as I thought earlier, giving 384. But I'm not sure if that's the correct interpretation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second part, which is 64, so 384. Alternatively, maybe it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would involve finding the term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, because then when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), it would give \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). That makes more sense because then the coefficient would be a number, not involving \\(c\\).\n\nSo, let me try that approach. First, find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, as before. Then, find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because when we multiply these two, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by the \\(c^0\\) term from the second part, resulting in \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion.\n\nSo, how do I find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)? Using the binomial expansion, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\), as I had earlier. So, we need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be 0, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which implies \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). So, the answer should be 120.\n\nWait, but let me confirm this because I might have made a mistake. So, in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0 is when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), so \\(m = 3\\). The coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\), which is indeed 20. So, that part is correct.\n\nThen, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, so when we multiply these together, we get 6 * 20 = 120. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 120.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought maybe the problem was asking for the coefficient without considering \\(c\\), but I think this approach is more accurate because it's considering the specific term where \\(c\\) cancels out, leaving \\(a^2b^2\\). So, I think 120 is the correct answer.\n\nLet me just recap to make sure I didn't miss anything. The problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is to take the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from \\((a + b)^4\\) and multiply it by the \\(c^0\\) term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The coefficient from the first part is 6, and from the second part, it's 20, so 6 * 20 = 120. That seems correct.\n\nI don't think I made any mistakes in the calculations. The binomial coefficients are correct, and the exponents add up properly. So, I'm confident that the coefficient is 120.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break the problem into two parts:\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   The general term is \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^{k}\\). For \\(a^2b^2\\), we need \\(k = 2\\), so the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n\n2. **Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) and find the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0:**\n   The general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). Setting \\(6 - 2m = 0\\) gives \\(m = 3\\), so the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n\nMultiplying these coefficients together gives the final coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) as \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer:** \\(\\boxed{120}\\)"

    "text": " The binomial theorem says that \\((a + b)^n = \\sum_{k=0}^{n} \\dbinom{n}{k} a^{n - k}b^k\\). So, maybe I can apply that here.\n\nAlright, let's start with the first part: \\((a + b)^4\\). Using the binomial theorem, this should expand to \\(\\dbinom{4}{0}a^4 + \\dbinom{4}{1}a^3b + \\dbinom{4}{2}a^2b^2 + \\dbinom{4}{3}ab^3 + \\dbinom{4}{4}b^4\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) here is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). I remember that \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) is calculated as \\(\\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient from the first part is 6.\n\nNow, the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I need to figure out how this affects the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait a minute, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is only from the first part, right? Because the second part involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), which are different variables. So, does that mean that the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part will be multiplied by every term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\n\nBut hold on, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and I think that term is only present in the first part. The second part doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), so when we multiply the two expressions together, the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) is by taking the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part and multiplying it by the entire second part. But wait, that would mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that can't be right because the question is asking for a coefficient, which is a number, not an expression with \\(c\\).\n\nHmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, actually, in the entire product, we're looking for the term that has \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). But since \\(a^2b^2\\) only comes from the first part, and the second part is multiplied by it, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that's not a single term; it's a polynomial in \\(c\\). So, maybe the question is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which would just be 6 times the entire expansion. But that doesn't make much sense because the coefficient is usually a number, not another polynomial.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, so the coefficient would include terms from the second expansion. But that would mean the coefficient is actually a polynomial in \\(c\\), which seems odd. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some \\(k\\), but the question doesn't specify.\n\nWait, no, the problem specifically says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\". So, maybe it's considering the entire product, and when you expand everything, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will have a coefficient that is a combination of terms from both expansions. But that would mean that the coefficient isn't a single number but a sum of terms involving \\(c\\). Hmm, that seems confusing. Let me think again.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, and not considering the second part. But that seems unlikely because the entire expression is the product of both parts.\n\nWait, maybe I need to consider that when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by every term in the second part, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), etc. But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would only come from the product where the power of \\(c\\) is zero, i.e., where \\(c^0\\). But wait, the second part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), so when expanded, the constant term (the term with \\(c^0\\)) would be the middle term. Let me calculate that.\n\nSo, the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) can be done using the binomial theorem as well. The general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - k}\\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\\). We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\), which is 20. So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part is 20.\n\nTherefore, when we multiply the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part, which has a coefficient of 6, by the constant term 20 from the second part, we get \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 120.\n\nWait, but I'm not sure if this is correct because the problem didn't specify anything about \\(c\\). Maybe I'm overcomplicating it by considering the \\(c\\) terms. Let me try another approach. Suppose we consider the entire product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). If we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then the coefficient would be the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and the entire second part. But that would mean the coefficient is 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial, not a number. But the problem is asking for a coefficient, which should be a number. So, maybe I was right the first time, that we need the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by the constant term in the second part, so that the overall term is \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is just \\(a^2b^2\\), and its coefficient is 120.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is only considering the coefficients in the combined expression, but I'm not sure. Let me think again. If we expand the entire expression, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will appear multiplied by all the terms from the second part. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in the second part. But the sum of the coefficients in the second part is found by setting \\(c = 1\\). So, \\(\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times 64, which is 384. But that seems too high.\n\nWait, but I think that's not correct because the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is only 6 multiplied by the entire second polynomial, not the sum of its coefficients. So, perhaps the coefficient is 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that's a polynomial, not a number. So, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and not considering the second part. But that seems odd because the entire expression is the product of both parts.\n\nI'm getting confused here. Let me try to clarify. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when we expand this product, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. Therefore, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), etc. However, the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would imply that we're looking for the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, i.e., the constant term. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the constant term in the second part, which we calculated as 20. Therefore, the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nYes, that makes sense now. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we first determine the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem, which is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Next, we identify the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which occurs when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. This term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying these coefficients together gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\boxed{120}"

So, each term in this expansion is \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k} b^k\\), where \\(k\\) goes from 0 to 4.\n\nNow, the problem asks for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, I need to find the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2. That means I need to find the value of \\(k\\) such that \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). Let me check that: if \\(k = 2\\), then \\(4 - 2 = 2\\), so yes, that's the term we want.

So, the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) for \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6.\n\nOkay, so that takes care of the first part. Now, the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Hmm, so does this affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)? Wait, the \\(c\\) terms are separate from \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), so when we multiply out the entire expression, the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) will be multiplied by the terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), the \\(c\\) terms don't directly affect that coefficient, right? Because \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), so when we multiply, the coefficient will just be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but since we're only looking for the term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), which would be the constant term, because \\(a^2b^2\\) is just a scalar multiple, so maybe I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) and then multiply it by 6.\n\nWait, let me think again. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, when we multiply them, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), that means we need to find all the terms in the second expansion that, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), result in \\(a^2b^2\\) times something. But wait, no, actually, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term is independent of \\(c\\), so when we multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by terms involving \\(c\\), we'll get terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some \\(k\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would only come from the term where the second factor is 1, i.e., the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, I think I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) and then multiply it by 6, the coefficient from the first part.\n\nWait, let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. If I have \\((a + b)^4\\) times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), then when I multiply them, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, for the term \\(a^2b^2\\) to appear in the product, it must be multiplied by a term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) that is a constant (i.e., \\(c^0\\)), because otherwise, you'd have \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2/c^k\\), which are different terms. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part. So, that makes sense.\n\nSo, now I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Let's use the binomial theorem again. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(1/c\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m} = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\).\n\nWe need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so we set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\).\n\nCalculating \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\): that's \\(6! / (3! * 3!) = (720) / (6 * 6) = 720 / 36 = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the coefficient from the first part (6) multiplied by the constant term from the second part (20), so 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, let me double-check that. So, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. In \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the constant term is 20. So, when we multiply the two expressions, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by 20, giving \\(20a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient is 20 * 6 = 120. Hmm, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider that the entire expression is a product, so the coefficients multiply. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is indeed the product of the coefficients from each part, provided that the other parts don't contribute any variables. Since the second part contributes a constant term, which is 20, then yes, the total coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but let me think again: when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficients of the terms multiply if the variables don't interfere. So, since in the first polynomial, we have \\(a^2b^2\\), and in the second polynomial, we have a constant term, then when we multiply them, the resulting term is \\(a^2b^2\\) times the constant, so the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120. That makes sense.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of it as the entire product being \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), and when looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), it's equivalent to taking the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and multiplying it by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term without \\(c\\), we need to find the part of the product where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by 1 (from the second expansion), which is the constant term.\n\nSo, yes, I think 120 is the correct coefficient.\n\nWait, just to make sure, maybe I can try expanding both parts and see.\n\nFirst, expanding \\((a + b)^4\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed \\(6a^2b^2\\). Then, expanding \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the constant term is 20, as we calculated. So, when we multiply these together, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by 20, giving \\(120a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient is 120.\n\nI think that's correct. So, the answer should be 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem.\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k} b^k\n   \\]\n   The term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\):\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} a^{2} b^{2} = 6a^2b^2\n   \\]\n   So, the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\n2. **Find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n   \\]\n   The constant term occurs when the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0:\n   \\[\n   6 - 2m = 0 \\implies m = 3\n   \\]\n   The constant term is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\n   \\]\n\n3. **Multiply the coefficients from both parts:**\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficients from each part:\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 20 = 120\n   \\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

That part seems straightforward.\n\nNow, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are only in the first part, and \\(c\\) is in the second part. So, does that mean that \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\) at all? Because the second part is multiplied by the first part, but \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are only in the first factor.\n\nLet me think about this. If I have \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), then each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).

That term doesn't involve \\(c\\) at all, right? Because \\(a^2b^2\\) is just a term with \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), no \\(c\\). So, in order for the product \\(a^k b^{4 - k} \\cdot c^{2m - 6}\\) to result in \\(a^2b^2\\), the exponent of \\(c\\) must be zero. That is, \\(2m - 6 = 0\\), which implies \\(m = 3\\).\n\nSo, when \\(m = 3\\), the term in the second expansion \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} c^3 \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^{3} = \\dbinom{6}{3} c^{0} = 20 \\cdot 1 = 20\\).\n\nTherefore, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion is multiplied by 20 from the second expansion.

Let me go through it again.\n\nFirst, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6. Then, in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the expansion is similar.

So, to get the term where \\(c^0\\), we set \\(2m - 6 = 0\\), so \\(m = 3\\). The coefficient here is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n\nSo, when we multiply the two expansions together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by 20 from the second part. So, the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but let me think if there's another way to approach this problem. Maybe I can consider the entire expression as a product and see if the coefficients multiply as I thought.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can consider that since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are only in the first factor, and \\(c\\) is only in the second, the variables are independent. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would just be the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and the constant term (i.e., the term with \\(c^0\\)) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nWait, that makes sense. Because when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term is the product of the coefficients from each polynomial, provided that the variables don't interfere. Since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is to take \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part and the constant term from the second part.\n\nSo, as I calculated before, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. So, 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nHmm, that seems consistent. Let me check the calculation for \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Yes, 6 choose 3 is 20, because 6! / (3!3!) = (720)/(6*6) = 720/36 = 20.\n\nAnd in the first part, 4 choose 2 is 6, which is correct.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nI think that makes sense. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning. So, the final answer should be 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem.\n\nFirst, consider the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k} b^k\n\\]\nThe term \\(a^2b^2\\) occurs when \\(k = 2\\), which gives:\n\\[\n\\dbinom{4}{2} a^2 b^2 = 6 a^2 b^2\n\\]\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\nNext, consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem:\n\\[\n\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^{6 - m} = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{2m - 6}\n\\]\nWe need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, which occurs when \\(2m - 6 = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\) gives \\(m = 3\\). The coefficient for this term is:\n\\[\n\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\n\\]\n\nSince the term \\(a^2b^2\\) does not involve \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficients from each part:\n\\[\n6 \\times 20 = 120\n\\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

    "text": " The binomial theorem says that \\((a + b)^n = \\sum_{k=0}^{n} \\binom{n}{k} a^{n - k}b^k\\). So, maybe I can apply that here.\n\nLet me start by expanding \\((a + b)^4\\). Using the binomial theorem, this would be \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\binom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\\). I need the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which means I need the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2. So, let's see, when \\(4 - k = 2\\), that means \\(k = 2\\). So the coefficient is \\(\\binom{4}{2}\\).\n\nCalculating \\(\\binom{4}{2}\\), that's \\(\\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. Got that part.\n\nNow, the expression also has \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I suppose this part doesn't affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) because \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) are separate variables from \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). So, when we multiply the two expressions together, the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) will be multiplied by terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), the \\(c\\) terms will just be coefficients themselves.\n\nWait, actually, no. Let me think again. When we multiply the two expressions, each term from \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the other part is in \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), the multiplication would just multiply the coefficients of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part by the coefficients of the terms in the second part.\n\nBut wait, no, that's not quite right. Let me clarify. The entire expression is a product of two polynomials, so when you multiply them, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second. However, since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\), and \\(1/c\\) are different variables, the only way the product will have a term with \\(a^2b^2\\) is if we take the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first polynomial and multiply it by any term from the second polynomial. But since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient would just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial multiplied by the entire second polynomial. Wait, that doesn't make sense because when you multiply, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try to structure it properly.\n\nThe original expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when you expand this, it's the product of two expansions. The expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) will give terms like \\(a^4\\), \\(a^3b\\), \\(a^2b^2\\), etc., and the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) will give terms like \\(c^6\\), \\(c^5 \\times \\dfrac{1}{c} = c^4\\), \\(c^3 \\times \\dfrac{1}{c^2} = c\\), and so on, down to \\(\\dfrac{1}{c^6}\\).\n\nNow, when you multiply these two expansions together, each term from the first expansion is multiplied by each term from the second. So, for the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion, which has a coefficient of 6, it will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), we're looking for how many times \\(a^2b^2\\) appears in the product. But actually, \\(a^2b^2\\) is just a term from the first part, and when multiplied by any term from the second part, it becomes \\(a^2b^2 \\times \\text{something}\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would actually be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part, because each term in the second part is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\).\n\nWait, that doesn't sound right because \\(a^2b^2\\) is just one term, and when you multiply it by each term in the second expansion, you get terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), etc. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not \\(a^2b^2c^6\\) or anything else. So, actually, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) itself doesn't involve \\(c\\), so the only way \\(a^2b^2\\) appears in the product is if it's multiplied by a term that is \\(c^0\\), which is 1, from the second expansion. Because if you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by \\(c^k\\), you get \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), which is a different term, not just \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) as a standalone term in the product is if you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by the constant term (i.e., \\(c^0\\)) from the second expansion.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is equal to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part.\n\nSo, first, we already found that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\nNow, we need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let's expand this using the binomial theorem as well.\n\nThe expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\binom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\binom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\).\n\nWe need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so we set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\).\n\nTherefore, the coefficient is \\(\\binom{6}{3}\\).\n\nCalculating that, \\(\\binom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\).\n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion is 20.\n\nNow, putting it all together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the second part), which is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nWait, but let me double-check that. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first part with coefficient 6, and the term \\(c^0\\) (which is just 1) comes from the second part with coefficient 20. So, when you multiply these two terms together, you get \\(6 \\times 20 \\times a^2b^2 \\times 1 = 120a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient is indeed 120.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should think of it as the entire product, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, but that doesn't make sense because only the constant term contributes to \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, no, because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by any term in the second expansion, you get a term like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), which isn't \\(a^2b^2\\) unless \\(k=0\\). So, only the constant term in the second expansion contributes to \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product.\n\nSo, yeah, I think 120 is the correct coefficient.\n\nWait, another way to think about it: The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). When you expand this, each term is a product of a term from the first expansion and a term from the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term from the second expansion, but only the term that is \\(c^0\\) will result in a term that's \\(a^2b^2\\). All other terms will have additional factors of \\(c^k\\), making them \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), which are different terms. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just the coefficient from the first part times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) from the second part, which is 6 times 20, giving 120.\n\nI think that makes sense. So, the final answer should be 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem.\n\nFirst, we expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\binom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n\\]\nWe need the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which occurs when \\(k = 2\\). The coefficient is:\n\\[\n\\binom{4}{2} = \\frac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\n\\]\n\nNext, we consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):\n\\[\n\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\binom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\binom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n\\]\nWe need the coefficient of \\(c^0\\), which occurs when \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(k = 3\\). The coefficient is:\n\\[\n\\binom{6}{3} = \\frac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\n\\]\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficients from the two expansions:\n\\[\n6 \\times 20 = 120\n\\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}."

So maybe I don't need to worry about the other part, or do I?\n\nWait, no, actually, the entire expression is the product of \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is part of the first part, and since the second part is in terms of \\(c\\), maybe the variables are separate. So, perhaps the coefficients for each part multiply together? Let me think.\n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is a certain number, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is another number because when you multiply the two expressions together, the only way to get a term with \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms is if the second part contributes a constant term (i.e., \\(c^0\\)). So, I need to find both coefficients and then multiply them together.\n\nLet me start with the first part: \\((a + b)^4\\). Using the binomial theorem, the expansion is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^4 \\binom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\\). So, the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) occurs is when \\(4 - k = 2\\), so \\(k = 2\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(\\binom{4}{2}\\), which is 6. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6.\n\nNow, moving on to the second part: \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) because when I multiply this by \\(a^2b^2\\), I don't want any \\(c\\) terms, just the constant term. So, using the binomial theorem again, the expansion is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^6 \\binom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying the exponents, that's \\(\\sum_{m=0}^6 \\binom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\).\n\nI need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be 0, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\).

So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part is 20.\n\nNow, since the original expression is the product of the two parts, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) (which comes from the first part) multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) (from the second part) will give me the overall coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression. So, that's 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. Is there any possibility that I need to consider cross terms or something else?

Since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), their coefficients multiply directly. So, I think 120 is correct.\n\nLet me just recap to make sure I didn't skip any steps. I found the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part, which is 20. Multiplying them gives 120, so that's the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression.

So, I need to multiply these two expansions together. However, since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I realize that the terms involving \\(c\\) don't affect the powers of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). That is, when I multiply the two expressions, each term in the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But since I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I can focus on the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion and multiply it by each term in the second expansion. However, since the problem doesn't specify any conditions on \\(c\\), I think the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would just be the coefficient from the first expansion times the entire second expansion. But wait, that doesn't make sense because when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually be \\(6\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of the second polynomial. But that can't be right because the problem is asking for a specific coefficient, not a polynomial. Hmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). That is, when you multiply the two expressions together, you'll have terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), etc., and the coefficient for each of these would be 6 times the corresponding coefficient from the second expansion. But the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), without specifying any particular power of \\(c\\). So, maybe I need to consider that the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by all the terms in the second expansion, each contributing to different powers of \\(c\\). Therefore, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), then it's just 6 times the entire expansion of the second polynomial. But that doesn't seem right because the problem is probably expecting a numerical coefficient, not a polynomial. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, considering all possible terms, but that would be a sum of coefficients from each term involving \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for various \\(k\\). Hmm, but the way the problem is phrased, \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", without specifying \\(c\\), might mean that we're to treat \\(c\\) as an independent variable and just find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which would actually be a polynomial in \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems too broad. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, considering only the terms where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out, i.e., the constant term. Wait, that might make sense. Maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, considering only the constant term with respect to \\(c\\). So, that would mean I need to find the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, i.e., the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), and then multiply it by the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion.\n\nLet me check that. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, as I found earlier. Now, the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. From the expansion I did earlier, the constant term is 20. So, if I multiply these together, 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, considering only the constant term with respect to \\(c\\), would be 120.\n\nWait, but let me think again. The problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\". It doesn't specify anything about \\(c\\), so perhaps it's just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). That is, when you multiply the two polynomials, each term in the first will be multiplied by each term in the second, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the sum of 6 times each coefficient in the second expansion. But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. Therefore, I think the intended interpretation is that we're to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by the constant term in the second expansion. So, that would be 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable, so the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would make the coefficient a polynomial, not a single number. Since the problem asks for \"the coefficient\", which is usually a single number, I think the correct interpretation is that we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, considering only the constant term with respect to \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but let me make sure. Let's consider the entire product:\n\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = (a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4)(c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15c^{-2} + 6c^{-4} + c^{-6})\n\\]\n\nWhen we multiply these two, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first polynomial will be multiplied by each term in the second polynomial, resulting in terms like \\(6a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(6a^2b^2c^4\\), \\(6a^2b^2c^2\\), \\(6a^2b^2\\), \\(6a^2b^2c^{-2}\\), etc. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would actually be the sum of all these coefficients, but since the problem doesn't specify any particular power of \\(c\\), it's ambiguous. However, if we interpret the problem as asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then it's the sum of all coefficients from each term involving \\(a^2b^2c^k\\). But that would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6*(1 + 6 + 15 + 20 + 15 + 6 + 1) = 6*64 = 384. But that seems too large, and I don't think that's what the problem is asking for.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where the exponents of \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are 2, 2, and 0 respectively, then that would be 6 * 20 = 120, as I thought earlier.\n\nGiven that the problem is phrased as \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", without mentioning \\(c\\), it's a bit ambiguous. However, in problems like this, when multiple variables are present and only some are specified in the term, it's often implied that the coefficient is with respect to those variables, treating the others as constants or considering the constant term. So, I think the intended answer is 120.\n\nWait, but to be thorough, let me check another approach. Suppose I consider the entire product and collect like terms. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) will appear multiplied by each term in the second expansion, so the coefficient would be 6 times each coefficient in the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^6\\) is 6*1=6, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^4\\) is 6*6=36, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^2\\) is 6*15=90, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6*20=120, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^{-2}\\) is 6*15=90, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^{-4}\\) is 6*6=36, and the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^{-6}\\) is 6*1=6. So, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then it's the sum of all these coefficients: 6 + 36 + 90 + 120 + 90 + 36 + 6. Let me add these up:\n\n6 + 36 = 42\n\n42 + 90 = 132\n\n132 + 120 = 252\n\n252 + 90 = 342\n\n342 + 36 = 378\n\n378 + 6 = 384\n\nSo, the total coefficient of all terms involving \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\) is 384. But that seems like a lot, and I'm not sure if that's what the problem is asking for. It's more likely that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, which would be 384. However, considering the way the problem is phrased, it's more probable that it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, so the coefficient would be the polynomial 6*(c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15c^{-2} + 6c^{-4} + c^{-6}) = 6c^6 + 36c^4 + 90c^2 + 120 + 90c^{-2} + 36c^{-4} + 6c^{-6}. But since the problem is asking for a coefficient, not a polynomial, I think the intended answer is 120, which is the coefficient when \\(c\\) is at the zero power, i.e., the constant term.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused now. Let me think again. The problem is: What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, in the product, each term is of the form \\(a^kb^{4 - k}c^{m}\\), where \\(k\\) ranges from 0 to 4 and \\(m\\) ranges from -6 to 6 in steps of 2. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be when \\(k = 2\\), so that's fixed. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would then be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient is 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial in \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the polynomial \\(6c^6 + 36c^4 + 90c^2 + 120 + 90c^{-2} + 36c^{-4} + 6c^{-6}\\). But the problem is asking for \"the coefficient\", which is a single number, not a polynomial. Therefore, perhaps the problem is expecting the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, regardless of \\(c\\), which would mean summing all the coefficients from each term involving \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), which is 384. But I think that's unlikely because the problem includes \\(c\\) in the expression, so it's more about the product of two polynomials, and the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the polynomial as above. However, since the problem is asking for \"the coefficient\", perhaps it's intended to consider only the constant term with respect to \\(c\\), which is 120.\n\nGiven that, I think the answer is 120. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 120 when considering the constant term with respect to \\(c\\).\n\nWait, but to make sure, let me think of another approach. Suppose I treat \\(c\\) as another variable and expand the entire product, then collect terms. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the sum over all possible exponents of \\(c\\) of the coefficients from each term. But that would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the sum of all coefficients is 64, so 6*64 = 384. So, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), it's 384. But if it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), it's 120.\n\nI think the problem is more likely asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, so the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial. However, since the problem is asking for \"the coefficient\", which is usually a single number, I think the intended answer is 120, considering only the constant term with respect to \\(c\\). Therefore, I'll go with 120 as the answer.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is found by considering the constant term with respect to \\(c\\). \n\n1. Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is 6.\n2. Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) and find the constant term, which is 20.\n3. Multiply the two coefficients: \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{120}"

    "text": " Similarly, the other part \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) can also be expanded using the binomial theorem. \n\nWait, but the problem is asking specifically for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). That means I might not need to expand the entire expression, but rather find the part that contributes to \\(a^2b^2\\) and then multiply it by the corresponding part from the second expansion. Let me think.\n\nSo, starting with the first part: \\((a + b)^4\\). I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in this expansion. Using the binomial theorem, the expansion is the sum from \\(k = 0\\) to \\(4\\) of \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\\). So, the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) occurs is when \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). So, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Let me compute that: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\\). So, the coefficient from the first part is 6.\n\nNow, moving on to the second part: \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I need to figure out how this part affects the term \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, but actually, \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), so when we multiply the two expansions together, the variables from each part are independent. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by some term from the second expansion, but since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) don't appear in the second part, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression will just be 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. Wait, no, that doesn't make sense because the second part doesn't have \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), so when we multiply, each term from the first expansion is multiplied by each term from the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but \\(c\\) is another variable. So, actually, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, which are in terms of \\(c\\). So, unless we're looking for a specific term in \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) as a standalone term would just be 6 times the entire second expansion. But that doesn't seem right because the question is probably expecting a numerical coefficient, not a polynomial in \\(c\\). Hmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem.\n\nWait, let me read the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)\". So, maybe it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in other words, when we multiply the two expansions, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, so the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, not a single number. That doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a coefficient, which is a number. So, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times some specific power of \\(c\\), but it's not specified. Alternatively, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and the second part is irrelevant because \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) don't appear there. But that seems odd because the problem includes both parts.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again. The expression is \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When we expand this product, each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part will be multiplied by every term in the second expansion, which are terms like \\(c^6\\), \\(6c^4\\), \\(15c^2\\), \\(20\\), \\(15c^{-2}\\), \\(6c^{-4}\\), and \\(c^{-6}\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product will be 6 multiplied by each of these terms, meaning the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2c^6\\) is 6, for \\(a^2b^2c^4\\) is 6*6=36, and so on. But the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), without specifying any power of \\(c\\). So, perhaps the answer is simply 6 times the entire expansion of the second part, but that would be a polynomial, not a single number. Alternatively, maybe the problem is expecting the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), which would mean summing over all coefficients from the second expansion. Wait, no, that doesn't make sense because each term is separate.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is actually just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and the second part is a separate expression that doesn't affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). But that seems unlikely because the two parts are multiplied together. So, perhaps the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 times the entire expansion of the second part, but that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. So, maybe the problem is miswritten or I'm misinterpreting it.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), that is, the term where the powers of \\(c\\) cancel out. That would make sense because then the coefficient would be a single number. Let me check that possibility. So, if I'm looking for the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\), which is 1, then the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nOkay, that seems plausible. So, let's go with that interpretation. So, first, I'll find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6. Then, I'll find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Then, multiply those two coefficients together to get the final coefficient for \\(a^2b^2c^0\\).\n\nSo, let's compute the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem, the expansion is the sum from \\(k = 0\\) to \\(6\\) of \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k\\). Simplifying the exponent, that's \\(c^{6 - 2k}\\). We want the term where the exponent is 0, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(k = 3\\). So, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\).\n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire expression is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake here. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\) with coefficient 6, and the term \\(c^0\\) comes from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) with coefficient 20. So, when we multiply these two terms together, the coefficient becomes 6 * 20 = 120, and the variables are \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is just \\(a^2b^2\\). So, yes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without any condition on \\(c\\), then the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which would be a polynomial in \\(c\\). But since the problem is asking for a coefficient, which is a number, it's more likely that it's asking for the coefficient when the powers of \\(c\\) cancel out, i.e., the constant term.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6. Then, we find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20. Multiplying these together gives 6 * 20 = 120.\n\n\\boxed{120}"

The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\), and it's multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). However, the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not any terms involving \\(c\\). That means that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression will be the same as the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because when you multiply by something else, it scales the coefficient.\n\nWait, no, that might not be correct. Let me clarify. If I have \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by another expression, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire sum of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But actually, no, that's not quite right either because each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), we can think of it as the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nWait, that might make sense. Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by every term in the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be \\(6\\) (from the first part) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nBut wait, the sum of all coefficients in a polynomial is found by plugging in \\(c = 1\\). So, if I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = (2)^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 64.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). Hmm, that seems straightforward, but let me double-check to make sure I didn't miss anything.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider that the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), each term in the second expansion will just scale the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the total coefficient would indeed be the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which is 64. So, 6 times 64 is 384.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Is there another way to approach this? Maybe expanding both expressions separately and then multiplying the specific terms. Let me try that.\n\nFirst, from \\((a + b)^4\\), as I found earlier, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6.\n\nNow, for \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), let's expand it using the binomial theorem: \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\).\n\nSo, each term in this expansion is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\), where \\(m\\) ranges from 0 to 6.\n\nNow, when we multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) (which is 6a^2b^2) is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, which includes various powers of \\(c\\). But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), that means we need to consider all the terms from the second expansion and sum their coefficients.\n\nWait, but that's exactly what I did earlier. The sum of all coefficients in the second expansion is 64, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but hold on. Let me make sure that's correct. Because in reality, when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term is the sum of the products of the coefficients of terms whose exponents add up to that term. But in this case, since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), any term in the second expansion will just multiply the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) by the coefficient of that term in the second expansion. So, the total coefficient is indeed the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part.\n\nAlternatively, if I think of it as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) being 6, and then the second part being a generating function where each term's coefficient is added together when multiplied by a constant term (which \\(a^2b^2\\) is, in terms of \\(c\\)), then yes, the total coefficient would be 6 times 64.\n\nWait, but let me confirm by a different approach. Let's consider that when you multiply two expressions, the coefficient of a term is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each expression, summed over all possible combinations that result in the desired term. But in this case, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is in the first expression, and the second expression doesn't affect \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), only \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expression multiplied by the entire sum of the coefficients in the second expression, because each term in the second expression is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), effectively scaling it by each of their coefficients.\n\nSo, if I denote \\(P(a, b) = (a + b)^4\\) and \\(Q(c) = \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), then the product \\(P(a, b) \\times Q(c)\\) will have the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) as \\([a^2b^2]P(a, b) \\times [c^0]Q(c)\\), but wait, no, because \\(Q(c)\\) doesn't have a \\(c^0\\) term. Wait, actually, \\(Q(c)\\) does have a constant term when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), so \\(m = 3\\). So, the constant term in \\(Q(c)\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(P(a, b)\\) multiplied by the constant term in \\(Q(c)\\), which is 20. So, that would be 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, now I'm confused because earlier I thought it was 384, but now I'm getting 120. Which one is correct?\n\nLet me think carefully. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product. Since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is by multiplying the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expression by a term that has \\(c^0\\) from the second expression. Because if you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by a term with \\(c^k\\), you'd get \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), which is not just \\(a^2b^2\\). So, to get exactly \\(a^2b^2\\), you need to multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by the constant term (i.e., \\(c^0\\) term) from the second expression.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part.\n\nSo, in the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6.\n\nIn the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term with \\(c^0\\) occurs when the exponents of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) cancel out. That happens when \\(m = 3\\), because each term is \\(c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, setting \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), we get \\(m = 3\\). The coefficient for that term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nWait, so earlier I thought it was 384, but now I'm getting 120. I must have made a mistake in the first approach. Let me see where I went wrong.\n\nIn the first approach, I considered that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second expression, which is 64. But that would be the case if we were looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^k\\) for any \\(k\\), but the problem is only asking for \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\). So, actually, only the term where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out (i.e., the constant term) would contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms. Therefore, the correct approach is to multiply the coefficient from the first part by the constant term in the second part, which is 20, giving 120.\n\nSo, I think my second approach is correct, and the first approach was incorrect because I mistakenly thought that all coefficients would contribute, but in reality, only the constant term in the second expression affects the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product.\n\nLet me double-check this reasoning. When you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum of the products of the coefficients of terms in each polynomial that combine to form that specific term. In this case, the specific term is \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\). Therefore, the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is by multiplying \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first polynomial by the constant term from the second polynomial. Any other term from the second polynomial would introduce a power of \\(c\\), making the term \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), which is not what we want.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient is indeed 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but let me confirm this by expanding both expressions and looking at the product. Let's see:\n\nFirst, \\((a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\).\n\nSecond, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15\\dfrac{1}{c^2} + 6\\dfrac{1}{c^4} + \\dfrac{1}{c^6}\\).\n\nNow, when we multiply these two, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expression will be multiplied by each term in the second expression. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), we need to find all terms in the product that result in \\(a^2b^2\\) times some power of \\(c\\), but since the problem doesn't specify any power of \\(c\\), it's just \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\). Wait, no, actually, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term in the product, but in the product, each term is a combination of powers of \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) can only come from multiplying \\(a^2b^2\\) by the constant term in the second expression. Because if you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by \\(c^k\\), you get \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), which is a different term. Therefore, the only contribution to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is from the constant term in the second expression.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Suppose I set \\(c = 1\\). Then, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = 64\\), as I calculated earlier. So, the entire expression becomes \\((a + b)^4 * 64\\). Then, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in this would be 6 * 64 = 384. But this is only true if we set \\(c = 1\\), which would make all the \\(c\\) terms disappear, effectively treating the second expression as a constant. But in reality, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, not when \\(c = 1\\). So, perhaps I'm confusing the concepts here.\n\nWait, no. When you set \\(c = 1\\), you're evaluating the entire expression at \\(c = 1\\), which gives you the sum of all coefficients in the second expression multiplied by the first expression. But the problem isn't asking for the value of the expression at \\(c = 1\\); it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term in the expanded form, regardless of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6 times the constant term in the second expression, which is 20, giving 120.\n\nAlternatively, if I consider that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then it's actually the sum of all coefficients in the second expression multiplied by the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expression. But that would give me 6 * 64 = 384. Wait, but that would be the case if the problem were asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times any power of \\(c\\). But the problem is just asking for \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), so only the constant term in the second expression contributes.\n\nTherefore, I think the correct answer is 120, not 384. I must have made a mistake in the first approach by incorrectly assuming that all coefficients contribute, when in fact only the constant term does.\n\nLet me try another approach to confirm. Let's denote the entire expression as \\(E = (a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). We can write \\(E\\) as:\n\n\\(E = (a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15\\dfrac{1}{c^2} + 6\\dfrac{1}{c^4} + \\dfrac{1}{c^6}\\right)\\).\n\nNow, when we expand this, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in the second expression. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in the second expression, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), \\(a^2b^2c^2\\), \\(a^2b^2\\), \\(a^2b^2\\dfrac{1}{c^2}\\), etc. However, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is the term where the exponents of \\(c\\) are zero. That is, only the term \\(a^2b^2 \\times 20\\) contributes to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). All other terms would have a power of \\(c\\) and thus wouldn't be part of the \\(a^2b^2\\) term.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(E\\) is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nWait, but I'm still a bit confused because earlier I thought about the sum of coefficients being 64, but that's when \\(c = 1\\), which isn't the same as the constant term. So, to clarify, the sum of coefficients in the second expression is 64, which is when you set \\(c = 1\\). But the constant term is when \\(c^0\\), which is 20. So, when you multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), you get \\(a^2b^2\\) times the sum of all coefficients, but that would be if you're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times any power of \\(c\\). But since the problem is only asking for \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\), it's only the constant term that contributes.\n\nWait, no, actually, if the problem had asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some \\(k\\), then you would multiply by the corresponding coefficient in the second expression. But since it's just \\(a^2b^2\\), the only way that can happen is if \\(k = 0\\), so you only take the constant term.\n\nTherefore, I'm confident now that the coefficient is 120.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Suppose I consider the entire product \\(E = (a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from multiplying the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in \\((a + b)^4\\) by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a scalar (with respect to \\(c\\)), multiplying it by each term in the second expression just gives \\(a^2b^2\\) times each coefficient, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), etc. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is actually zero because \\(a^2b^2\\) is not multiplied by a \\(c^0\\) term. Wait, that can't be right because we know that the constant term exists.\n\nWait, no, that's not correct. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term in the second expression, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the sum of all coefficients in the second expression multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). But \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), so when you multiply it by the entire second expression, you get \\(a^2b^2\\) times the sum of the coefficients of the second expression. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is indeed 6 times 64, which is 384.\n\nWait, now I'm really confused. Let me try to clarify this once and for all.\n\nWhen you have two polynomials multiplied together, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum of the products of the coefficients of terms in each polynomial that combine to form that specific term.\n\nIn this case, the specific term is \\(a^2b^2\\). To get \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, you need to multiply a term from the first polynomial by a term from the second polynomial such that the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) add up to 2 each, and the exponents of \\(c\\) add up to 0 (since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\)).\n\nBut wait, the first polynomial is \\((a + b)^4\\), which only involves \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). The second polynomial is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which only involves \\(c\\). Therefore, when you multiply them, the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) come from the first polynomial, and the exponents of \\(c\\) come from the second. Therefore, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product can only come from multiplying \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first polynomial by the constant term (i.e., \\(c^0\\)) from the second polynomial. Because if you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by any other term from the second polynomial, you'll end up with a term that has \\(c\\) raised to some power, which won't be \\(a^2b^2\\) but \\(a^2b^2c^k\\).\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second polynomial. That is, 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nSo, I think the correct answer is 120. My initial confusion came from considering the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 64, but that's only relevant if we were looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times any power of \\(c\\), but since we're only interested in \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\), only the constant term contributes.\n\nTo further confirm, let's consider a simpler example. Suppose we have \\((a + b)^1 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^1 = (a + b)(c + 1/c)\\). The coefficient of \\(a^1b^0\\) in this product would be the coefficient of \\(a\\) in the first polynomial times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second polynomial. Since the first polynomial is \\(a + b\\), the coefficient of \\(a\\) is 1. The second polynomial is \\(c + 1/c\\), which has a constant term of 0 (since there's no \\(c^0\\) term). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a\\) in the product would be 1 * 0 = 0. But wait, that's not correct because when you multiply \\(a\\) by \\(c\\) and \\(a\\) by \\(1/c\\), you get \\(ac\\) and \\(a/c\\), neither of which is \\(a\\). So, indeed, the coefficient of \\(a\\) in the product is 0, which matches the calculation.\n\nAnother example: \\((a + b)^2 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^2\\). The coefficient of \\(a^2b^0\\) would be the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) in the first polynomial (which is 1) times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second polynomial. The second polynomial is \\(c^2 + 2 + 1/c^2\\), so the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 2. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) in the product is 1 * 2 = 2. Let's check by expanding: \\((a + b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2\\), and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^2 = c^2 + 2 + 1/c^2\\). Multiplying these, the term \\(a^2\\) is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial, giving \\(a^2c^2 + 2a^2 + a^2/c^2\\). The coefficient of \\(a^2\\) is indeed 2, which comes from the constant term in the second polynomial. So, this confirms that the approach is correct.\n\nTherefore, applying this to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 * 20 = 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6. Then, we find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20. Multiplying these together gives 6 * 20 = 120.\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

    "text": " The same goes for \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, the problem is asking specifically for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, I think I can handle this by expanding each part separately and then combining them.\n\nLet me start with the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\). Using the binomial theorem, the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is the sum from \\(k = 0\\) to \\(4\\) of \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k} b^k\\). So, the general term is \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k} b^k\\). I need the term where the exponents of both \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2. That means I need \\(4 - k = 2\\) for \\(a\\), so \\(k = 2\\). Therefore, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Let me compute that: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\\). So, that part gives me 6 times \\(a^2b^2\\).\n\nNow, moving on to the second part, which is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I also need to expand this using the binomial theorem. The expansion will be the sum from \\(m = 0\\) to \\(6\\) of \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying each term, that becomes \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m} = \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). \n\nBut wait, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\). So, does that mean I need to consider the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)? Because if I have a constant term, then when I multiply it by \\(a^2b^2\\), it will contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). If there are other terms with \\(c\\) raised to some power, they won't contribute because we don't have any \\(c\\) terms in \\(a^2b^2\\).\n\nSo, I need to find the term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, meaning \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Let me solve for \\(m\\): \\(6 - 2m = 0\\) implies \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the term where \\(m = 3\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} c^{0} = \\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20.\n\nNow, putting it all together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is the product of the coefficients from each part. That is, 6 (from \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part) multiplied by 20 (the constant term from the second part). So, 6 times 20 is 120.\n\nWait, let me double-check to make sure I didn't make a mistake. So, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6. In \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the constant term is when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which gives \\(m = 3\\), and the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying 6 and 20 gives 120. Yeah, that seems correct.\n\nI think I might have confused myself earlier by thinking about other terms, but since we're only interested in \\(a^2b^2\\), the other terms involving \\(c\\) won't affect it. So, I was right to focus on the constant term in the second part.\n\nJust to recap: The coefficient comes from the product of the coefficients of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion and the constant term in the second expansion.

But wait, the problem is only asking about the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so maybe I don't need to expand the entire expression. Let me think.\n\nAlright, the expression is a product of two binomials raised to powers: \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Since these are multiplied together, the terms from each expansion will multiply term by term. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), maybe we can find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), and then multiply it by the entire expansion of the second part, because \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) don't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\). That makes sense, right?\n\nSo, let's start with the first part: \\((a + b)^4\\). Using the binomial theorem, the expansion is the sum from \\(k = 0\\) to \\(4\\) of \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\\). We're interested in the term where the powers of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2.

So, the coefficient here is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\).\n\nCalculating that, \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\nNow, since we're multiplying this by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the entire expansion of the second part will multiply the 6 we just found. But wait, the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so maybe I don't need to worry about the \\(c\\) terms because they don't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) coefficients. Hmm, that seems right because \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) are separate variables, so when we multiply, the coefficients for \\(a^2b^2\\) will just be multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part, but since we're only looking for the coefficient, not the entire term, perhaps I just need to consider that the coefficient is 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion.\n\nWait, no, that might not be correct. Let me think again. The expression is \\((a + b)^4\\) times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, when we expand both, each term in the first expansion will multiply each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would be the same as 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. But wait, no, because each term in the second expansion is a term involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), so when we multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each of those, the resulting term will have \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by some power of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product will be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, each term contributes a coefficient to \\(a^2b^2\\) times some power of \\(c\\), but since the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) part, we can consider that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion.\n\nWait, but that doesn't seem right. Let me clarify. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product. That means, in the expanded form, the coefficient of the term that has \\(a^2b^2\\) times any power of \\(c\\). So, actually, the coefficient will be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, because each term in the second expansion contributes a coefficient that, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), gives a term where the coefficient is 6 times that coefficient.\n\nBut wait, the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\). So, substituting \\(c = 1\\), we get \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 times 64, which is 384.\n\nWait, but that seems a bit high. Let me check again. Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is in the first part, and the second part is multiplied by it, but since the second part doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), every term in the second expansion will just multiply the entire \\(a^2b^2\\) term by their respective coefficients. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be the coefficient from the first part (which is 6) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part (which is 64). Therefore, 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me think differently. Maybe I should consider that the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first part, and when multiplied by any term from the second part, it's just \\(a^2b^2\\) times something with \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, the coefficient would just be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, because each term in the second expansion adds a multiple of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, yes, 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm supposed to consider that the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is only one term, and when multiplied by the entire second expansion, the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion's coefficients. But that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6*64=384.\n\nWait, but let me make sure. Let me consider a simpler example. Suppose I have (a + b)^2 * (c + 1/c)^1. The coefficient of a^2b^2 would be zero because (a + b)^2 only goes up to a^2b^0 and b^2a^0, but wait, no, in (a + b)^2, the terms are a^2, 2ab, and b^2. So, the coefficient of a^2 is 1, and the coefficient of b^2 is 1. So, if I multiply by (c + 1/c), the coefficient of a^2 would be 1*(1 + 1) = 2, and similarly for b^2. But in this case, the term a^2b^2 doesn't exist in (a + b)^2, so the coefficient would be zero. Hmm, maybe my approach is wrong.\n\nWait, in the original problem, (a + b)^4 has a term a^2b^2 with coefficient 6. Then, when multiplied by (c + 1/c)^6, each term in (c + 1/c)^6 is a coefficient times c^k, where k ranges from -6 to +6 in steps of 2. So, when we multiply 6a^2b^2 by each term in the second expansion, we get terms like 6 * (coefficient) * a^2b^2c^k. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of a^2b^2, regardless of the c terms. So, in effect, the coefficient of a^2b^2 in the entire product is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, because each term in the second expansion contributes a multiple of a^2b^2. So, the sum of coefficients in the second expansion is when c=1, which is 2^6=64, so 6*64=384.\n\nWait, but in my earlier example, when I had (a + b)^2*(c + 1/c), the coefficient of a^2 would be 1*(1 + 1)=2, and similarly for b^2, but in that case, a^2b^2 doesn't exist, so maybe my approach is correct.\n\nWait, but in the original problem, the term a^2b^2 is present in (a + b)^4, so when multiplied by each term in the second expansion, each term contributes a coefficient to a^2b^2 times some power of c. Therefore, the coefficient of a^2b^2 in the entire product is the sum over all coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by 6. So, the sum of coefficients in the second expansion is 64, so 6*64=384.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should think of it as the product of the two expansions. The coefficient of a^2b^2 in the first part is 6, and the entire second part is a polynomial in c, so when you multiply 6a^2b^2 by the second polynomial, the coefficient of a^2b^2 in the product is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial, because each term in the second polynomial adds a multiple of a^2b^2. So, yes, 6*64=384.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Suppose I have (a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4. Then, when I multiply this by (c + 1/c)^6, each term in (a + b)^4 will be multiplied by each term in (c + 1/c)^6. So, the term 6a^2b^2 will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, resulting in terms like 6a^2b^2c^6, 6a^2b^2c^4, etc., all the way down to 6a^2b^2c^{-6}. Therefore, in the entire product, the coefficient of a^2b^2 is 6 times the sum of the coefficients of each term in the second expansion. Because each term in the second expansion contributes a coefficient that, when multiplied by 6a^2b^2, gives a term with coefficient 6*(coefficient from second expansion). Therefore, the total coefficient of a^2b^2 is 6*(sum of coefficients in second expansion).\n\nSince the sum of coefficients in the second expansion is when c=1, which is (1 + 1)^6=64, then the total coefficient is 6*64=384.\n\nWait, but let me verify this with a smaller exponent. Suppose instead of 6, the exponent is 2. Then, (c + 1/c)^2 = c^2 + 2 + 1/c^2. The sum of coefficients is 1 + 2 + 1 = 4. So, if I have (a + b)^2*(c + 1/c)^2, the coefficient of a^2b^0 would be 1*(sum of coefficients in second expansion) = 1*4=4, and similarly for b^2. But wait, in (a + b)^2, the coefficient of a^2 is 1, so when multiplied by the second expansion, the coefficient of a^2 times c^2, a^2 times 2, a^2 times 1/c^2, etc. So, the coefficient of a^2 in the product would be 1*(1 + 2 + 1)=4, which is correct because the product would have terms like a^2c^2, 2a^2, a^2/c^2, etc., so the coefficient of a^2 (regardless of c) is 4. Similarly, the coefficient of b^2 would be 4.\n\nSo, applying the same logic, in our original problem, the coefficient of a^2b^2 is 6*(sum of coefficients in second expansion) = 6*64=384.\n\nWait, but another way to think about it is that when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum of the products of the coefficients of terms whose variables multiply to that specific term. But in this case, since a and b are separate from c, the variables don't interfere. So, the coefficient of a^2b^2 in the product is the coefficient of a^2b^2 in the first polynomial multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial. Because when you multiply a^2b^2 by each term in the second polynomial, each term contributes its coefficient to a^2b^2 times some power of c. So, the total coefficient is 6*64=384.\n\nTherefore, I think the coefficient is 384.\n\nWait, but let me check once more. Alternatively, maybe I should compute the expansion of the second part and then multiply by 6, but that seems unnecessary because the sum of coefficients is 64.\n\nYes, I think that's correct. So, the coefficient is 384.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{384}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem for both parts of the expression.\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   The general term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is given by:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k} b^k\n   \\]\n   We are interested in the term where the powers of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2. This occurs when \\(k = 2\\):\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} a^2 b^2 = 6 a^2 b^2\n   \\]\n   Thus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\n2. **Consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   The sum of all coefficients in this expansion can be found by setting \\(c = 1\\):\n   \\[\n   \\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\n   \\]\n   Therefore, the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 64.\n\n3. **Combine the results:**\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is the product of the coefficient from the first part and the sum of the coefficients from the second part:\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 64 = 384\n   \\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{384}\\)."

    "text": " The binomial theorem says that \\((a + b)^n = \\sum_{k=0}^{n} \\dbinom{n}{k} a^{n - k} b^k\\). So, maybe I can apply that here.\n\nWait, but the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). That means I need to find the specific term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2. Let me write that down. So, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the general term is \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k} b^k\\). I need the term where \\(a^2b^2\\), so I can set up the exponents: \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). That makes sense because \\(4 - 2 = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\).\n\nCalculating that, \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. But wait, the original expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Does that mean I need to consider the entire expression, including the \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) part?\n\nHmm, let me think. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\). But the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when I multiply these two expansions together, each term from \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I need to see if multiplying by the other expansion affects this term.\n\nWait, no. Because \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, when I expand the entire expression, the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) will be multiplied by terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). But the term \\(a^2b^2\\) itself doesn't involve \\(c\\), so when I multiply by the other expansion, I'm essentially multiplying \\(a^2b^2\\) by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since I'm only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I think that the coefficient will remain the same because \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by all the terms in the other expansion, but each of those terms is multiplied by different powers of \\(c\\), which don't affect the \\(a^2b^2\\) term's coefficient.\n\nWait, no, that doesn't sound right. Let me think again. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when I expand this, each term from the first expansion is multiplied by each term from the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion is multiplied by each term from the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would actually be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part, because each term in the second expansion is a multiple of \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), which doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\).\n\nWait, but the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, in the entire product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by each term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but since we're only interested in the term \\(a^2b^2\\), and not any terms involving \\(c\\), maybe the coefficient remains 6 because the other terms involve \\(c\\), which aren't part of \\(a^2b^2\\).\n\nWait, that doesn't make sense. Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), you get \\(a^2b^2\\) times a sum of terms involving \\(c\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) itself is just one term, but multiplied by all the terms in the second expansion. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nWait, but that would mean the coefficient is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, then the coefficient would be 6 times 64, which is 384. But that seems too large, and I'm not sure if that's correct.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is present only in the \\((a + b)^4\\) part, and when multiplied by the other part, it's multiplied by all the terms in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would appear multiplied by each term from the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nBut let me think again. Alternatively, maybe I'm supposed to consider that the entire expression is a product, so each term in the product is a combination of terms from both expansions. So, to get the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I need to consider all possible ways to get \\(a^2b^2\\) from the product, which would involve taking the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion and multiplying it by each term from the second expansion. But since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term without \\(c\\), the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * (sum of coefficients), which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but maybe that's not the right approach. Let me try another way. Let me think of the entire expression as a product of two polynomials. The first polynomial is \\((a + b)^4\\), and the second is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second, and the coefficients multiply. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial.\n\nBecause when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second polynomial, you get terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), etc., but the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) itself would be the sum of all the coefficients from the second polynomial multiplied by the coefficient from the first. So, yes, that would make the coefficient 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but I'm not sure if that's correct because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not considering any \\(c\\) terms. So, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Alternatively, perhaps the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is only present in the first part, and when you multiply by the second part, it's just multiplied by each term, but the coefficient remains 6 because each term in the second expansion is a separate term. But that doesn't seem right because when you multiply, the coefficients add up.\n\nWait, no. Let me think of it this way: The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When you expand this, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, which are of the form \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, each of these terms is a separate term in the product.\n\nBut the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would be the sum of all the coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by the coefficient from the first. Because each time you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by a term from the second expansion, you're effectively adding a term with \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by that coefficient. So, the total coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion.\n\nAs I thought earlier, the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), so it becomes \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me check that again. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). And \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) expands to terms involving \\(c^6, c^4, c^2, c^0, c^{-2}, c^{-4}, c^{-6}\\), each with their own coefficients. When I multiply these two, each term from the first is multiplied by each term from the second. So, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, resulting in \\(6a^2b^2c^6 + 6a^2b^2c^4 + \\dots + 6a^2b^2c^{-6}\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is indeed 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but I'm not sure if that's correct because when you multiply by \\(c^6\\), \\(c^4\\), etc., you're changing the variables, but the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms would just be the coefficient when multiplied by the constant term in the second expansion. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake here.\n\nLet me think again. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, if I'm looking for the term \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by any power of \\(c\\), then the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nBut wait, no, that can't be right because the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is just a single term, but when multiplied by the entire expansion, it becomes multiple terms, each with a different power of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) itself, without any \\(c\\) terms, would only be the term where the second expansion contributes a constant term, i.e., where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero.\n\nSo, maybe I should instead find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), and then multiply that by the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion.\n\nThat makes more sense. Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term from the second expansion, the only term that contributes to \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) is when the second term is \\(c^0\\), which is the constant term. So, the coefficient would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nOkay, so let me calculate that. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\).\n\nWe need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\).\n\nCalculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 * 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\).\n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, that makes more sense. Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by the constant term 20, you get \\(20a^2b^2\\), and when you multiply it by other terms like \\(c^6\\) or \\(c^{-6}\\), those become terms like \\(6a^2b^2c^6\\) or \\(6a^2b^2c^{-6}\\), which are different terms. So, the only term that contributes to \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) is the constant term, which is 20, so the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was 384, but that was when I considered the sum of all coefficients, which is 64. But now I realize that only the constant term contributes to \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\), so the correct coefficient is 120.\n\nLet me double-check this. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) has terms where the exponent of \\(c\\) is even numbers from -6 to 6. The term with \\(c^0\\) is when \\(k = 3\\), as I found earlier, and its coefficient is 20. So, when I multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by this term, I get \\(20a^2b^2\\). All other terms from the second expansion would introduce a power of \\(c\\), so they don't contribute to the term \\(a^2b^2\\) itself. Therefore, the coefficient is indeed 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but let me think again. If the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then I might have misread the problem. Because if it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) irrespective of \\(c\\), then it's 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. But if it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it's 120.\n\nWait, the problem says: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, it's just \\(a^2b^2\\), without any \\(c\\) terms. Therefore, it's only the term where \\(c\\) is raised to the zero power. So, the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So, the correct coefficient is 120.\n\nWait, but let me confirm this another way. Let's expand both parts separately and then see how they multiply.\n\nFirst, \\((a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\).\n\nSecond, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Let's expand that:\n\n\\[\n\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n\\]\n\nSo, the terms are:\n\n- \\(k=0\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{0}c^6 = 1 \\times c^6\\)\n- \\(k=1\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{1}c^4 = 6c^4\\)\n- \\(k=2\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{2}c^2 = 15c^2\\)\n- \\(k=3\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}c^0 = 20\\)\n- \\(k=4\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{4}c^{-2} = 15c^{-2}\\)\n- \\(k=5\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{5}c^{-4} = 6c^{-4}\\)\n- \\(k=6\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{6}c^{-6} = 1c^{-6}\\)\n\nNow, when we multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, resulting in:\n\n- \\(6a^2b^2c^6\\)\n- \\(6a^2b^2c^4\\)\n- \\(6a^2b^2c^2\\)\n- \\(6a^2b^2\\)\n- \\(6a^2b^2c^{-2}\\)\n- \\(6a^2b^2c^{-4}\\)\n- \\(6a^2b^2c^{-6}\\)\n\nSo, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms comes from multiplying \\(6a^2b^2\\) by the constant term \\(20\\), giving \\(6 \\times 20 a^2b^2 = 120a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient is 120.\n\nWait, but the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). So, perhaps the problem is only considering the term \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. In that case, the coefficient would be the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by 6, which is 6 * 64 = 384. But that seems contradictory because when you have variables involved, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, each with a different power of \\(c\\), so each of those would be separate terms.\n\nWait, but in reality, when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second, and the resulting terms are the product of the variables. So, if you're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, then you have to consider all the terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present, which would be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but that doesn't seem right because each multiplication by a term in the second expansion would create a new term with \\(a^2b^2\\) and some power of \\(c\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) itself would only be present when multiplied by the constant term in the second expansion, which is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nI think I'm confusing two different interpretations here. Let me clarify: the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term in the product. But in the product, \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term from the second expansion, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), etc. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) itself, without any \\(c\\) terms, only comes from multiplying \\(a^2b^2\\) by the constant term in the second expansion, which is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem had asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), that would also be 120. But if it's just \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\), then it's 6 * 64 = 384. However, in standard algebraic expressions, when you're asked for the coefficient of a specific term, it's understood to be the term with exactly those variables and exponents, regardless of other variables. So, in this case, since \\(a^2b^2\\) is part of the product, and the other part involves \\(c\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would only exist when multiplied by the constant term in the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient is 120.\n\nWait, but I'm still a bit confused because in the product, \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by all the terms from the second expansion, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), etc. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the sum of all the coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by 6, which is 6 * 64 = 384. But that would be the case if we were considering the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times any power of \\(c\\). However, if we're only interested in \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms, then it's 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nI think the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, meaning that it's looking for the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\). Therefore, the coefficient is 120.\n\nWait, but let me check this with a smaller example to make sure. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Let's compute this.\n\nFirst, \\((a + b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2\\).\n\nSecond, \\((c + 1/c)^1 = c + 1/c\\).\n\nMultiplying these together:\n\n\\(a^2(c + 1/c) + 2ab(c + 1/c) + b^2(c + 1/c)\\).\n\nExpanding, we get:\n\n\\(a^2c + a^2/c + 2abc + 2ab/c + b^2c + b^2/c\\).\n\nNow, let's look for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, in this expansion, there is no term with both \\(a^2\\) and \\(b^2\\), so the coefficient is zero. But according to the earlier logic, the coefficient would be the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) in the first part times the coefficient of \\(b^2\\) in the second part, but that doesn't apply here because \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are in separate terms.\n\nWait, perhaps my approach is flawed. Let me try a different example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^1 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, expanding, I get \\(ac + a/c + bc + b/c\\). There is no \\(a^2b^2\\) term here, so the coefficient is zero.\n\nWait, but in the original problem, the exponent on \\((a + b)\\) is 4, so there is an \\(a^2b^2\\) term. But in my smaller example, the exponent is 1, so no \\(a^2b^2\\) term exists. So, in the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion, which is 20, so 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nAlternatively, if I have \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^2\\), let's see. \\((a + b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2\\). \\((c + 1/c)^2 = c^2 + 2 + 1/c^2\\). Multiplying these together:\n\n\\(a^2(c^2 + 2 + 1/c^2) + 2ab(c^2 + 2 + 1/c^2) + b^2(c^2 + 2 + 1/c^2)\\).\n\nExpanding:\n\n\\(a^2c^2 + 2a^2 + a^2/c^2 + 2abc^2 + 4ab + 2ab/c^2 + b^2c^2 + 2b^2 + b^2/c^2\\).\n\nNow, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be present only if there's a term with both \\(a^2\\) and \\(b^2\\), but in this case, there isn't any such term. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is zero. But according to the earlier logic, the coefficient would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion. But in this case, the first expansion doesn't have an \\(a^2b^2\\) term, so the coefficient is zero, which matches.\n\nWait, but in the original problem, the first expansion does have an \\(a^2b^2\\) term, and the second expansion has a \\(c^0\\) term, so the coefficient should be 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nTherefore, I think the correct answer is 120.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought that when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by the entire second expansion, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, giving 384. But that's only if you're considering all terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any power of \\(c\\). However, if you're only looking for the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\), then it's 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nGiven that the problem asks for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I think it's referring to the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\), so the coefficient is 120.\n\nWait, but let me check this with another example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^3\\). Let's compute the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\).\n\nFirst, \\((a + b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2\\). The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) here is zero because it's a binomial expansion of degree 2, so the highest degree for both \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) is 2 each, but \\(a^2b^2\\) would require degree 4, which isn't present.\n\nWait, no, in \\((a + b)^2\\), the terms are \\(a^2\\), \\(2ab\\), and \\(b^2\\). There's no \\(a^2b^2\\) term. So, the coefficient is zero. Now, the second expansion is \\((c + 1/c)^3\\). The coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in this is \\(\\dbinom{3}{1} = 3\\), because when \\(k=1\\), \\(3 - 2*1 = 1\\), which isn't zero. Wait, no, let's compute it properly.\n\nWait, \\((c + 1/c)^3 = c^3 + 3c + 3/c + 1/c^3\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is zero because there's no constant term. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be zero, which makes sense because there's no \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first expansion.\n\nWait, but in the original problem, the first expansion does have an \\(a^2b^2\\) term, so the coefficient would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion, which is 20, giving 120.\n\nTherefore, I think the correct answer is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression is found by considering the term from \\((a + b)^4\\) and the constant term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\n1. Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is 6.\n2. Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) and find the constant term, which is 20.\n3. Multiply the two coefficients: \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\boxed{120}."

That means I probably don't need to expand the entire expression, just focus on the parts that will give me \\(a^2b^2\\).\n\nLet me start by looking at the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\). Using the binomial theorem, the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is the sum from \\(k = 0\\) to \\(4\\) of \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\\). So, the general term is \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\\). I'm interested in the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2, so that would be when \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). Let me compute that coefficient: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). \n\nCalculating \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\), which is \\(\\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. \n\nNow, the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product will be 6 multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because when we multiply the two parts together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will only be affected by the constant term (i.e., the term with \\(c^0\\)) from the second part. If there were other terms, they would introduce powers of \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), which we don't want since we're only looking for \\(a^2b^2\\).\n\nSo, now I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Again, using the binomial theorem, the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is the sum from \\(m = 0\\) to \\(6\\) of \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying the exponents, each term becomes \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). \n\nI need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be 0, so I set up the equation \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the term where \\(m = 3\\) will be the constant term. The coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\).\n\nCalculating \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\), which is \\(\\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20.\n\nNow, going back to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the two coefficients I found. That is, 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the second part). So, 6 times 20 is 120. \n\nWait a second, let me just make sure I didn't make a mistake. So, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6, and in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the constant term is 20. Multiplying them together gives 120. Hmm, that seems right. I don't think I missed anything here. So, yeah, the coefficient should be 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we start by expanding each part using the binomial theorem.\n\nFirst, consider the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\).

So maybe I don't need to worry about the second part when finding the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). \n\nLet me think. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) would come from the expansion. Using the binomial theorem, the general term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}a^{4 - k}b^k\\), where \\(k\\) goes from 0 to 4. So I need the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2. That would be when \\(4 - k = 2\\), which means \\(k = 2\\). So the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\), which is 6. \n\nWait, but the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Does that affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)? Hmm, I think not because \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) are separate variables from \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). So when we multiply the two expressions, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\), maybe the coefficient is just 6 times whatever the coefficient is in the second expansion when considering all terms. Wait, no, that doesn't make sense because the second expansion is separate. \n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, but \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), so when we expand the product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by the sum of all terms in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But actually, no, because each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\), it would just be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, that can't be right because the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) would be when we set \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So then, the coefficient would be 6 * 64 = 384. But that seems too high, and I'm not sure if that's the correct approach.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. It says the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term in the expansion. But in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term would be something like \\(a^kb^{4 - k} \\times c^m \\times (1/c)^{6 - m}\\), which simplifies to \\(a^kb^{4 - k}c^{m - (6 - m)}\\) = \\(a^kb^{4 - k}c^{2m - 6}\\). So the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would come from \\(k = 2\\) in the first part, which gives \\(a^2b^2\\), and then multiplied by each term in the second part. So the coefficient would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, because \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by every term in the second expansion. But wait, that's not exactly right because the problem might only be asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So perhaps the coefficient is just 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. But I'm not sure if that's what the problem is asking for.\n\nWait, another way to think about it: when you have two separate expressions multiplied together, the coefficient of a specific term in one part is multiplied by the entire expansion of the other part. So if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is 6 from the first part, then in the product, this term will be multiplied by every term from the second expansion. So the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * (1 + 1)^6 = 6 * 64 = 384. But that seems too straightforward, and I'm not sure if that's the correct approach because the problem might be expecting something else.\n\nWait, maybe I'm making a mistake here. Let me think again. The problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So when we expand this product, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, which is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\). So the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the sum of all coefficients from the second part, which is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^6 \\dbinom{6}{m} = 2^6 = 64\\). So the total coefficient would be 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but that seems too large, and I'm not sure if that's correct. Alternatively, maybe the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the powers of \\(c\\), so it's 6 multiplied by the entire expansion, which would indeed be 6 * 64 = 384. But I'm a bit confused because sometimes when you have products, the coefficients can interfere, but in this case, since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), I think that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are in one part and \\(c\\) is in another, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, and the second part doesn't affect it because it's multiplied by all terms involving \\(c\\). But that doesn't make sense because the entire product is considered, so the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion.\n\nWait, let me check with an example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^2 (c + 1/c)^1\\). The expansion would be \\((a^2 + 2ab + b^2)(c + 1/c)\\). The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be zero because in the first expansion, the highest power of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) is 2 and 2, but in the product, when you multiply by \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), you can't get \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), which would be needed for \\(a^2b^2\\) alone. Wait, but in this case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually be zero because you can't have \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms. Hmm, so maybe in the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is zero because you can't have \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms. But that contradicts my earlier thought.\n\nWait, no, in the original problem, the expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So when you expand it, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part would be multiplied by each term in the second part, which would give terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), etc. So the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would actually be the sum of all the coefficients from the second part multiplied by 6. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some \\(k\\). So maybe the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the powers of \\(c\\), which would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. But in reality, each term in the product would have \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by some power of \\(c\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) alone, without any \\(c\\) terms, would be zero because there's no term with \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion that's being multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, but that's not correct because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, you get terms with different powers of \\(c\\), but the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms would be zero because the second expansion doesn't have a constant term (i.e., \\(c^0\\)).\n\nWait, let me check that. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^6 \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - m} \\times (1/c)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^6 \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\). So the exponents of \\(c\\) would be \\(6, 4, 2, 0, -2, -4, -6\\). Wait, when \\(m = 3\\), we get \\(c^{6 - 6} = c^0\\). So there is a constant term in the second expansion, which is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So when we multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by this constant term, we get \\(a^2b^2 \\times 20\\). So the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (the constant term from the second part), giving 120.\n\nWait, that makes more sense. So I think I made a mistake earlier by considering the sum of all coefficients, but actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is only affected by the constant term in the second expansion because that's the only term that doesn't change the power of \\(c\\). So, to clarify, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part, but only the constant term (where \\(c^0\\)) will result in a term that's just \\(a^2b^2\\). All other terms would have \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by some power of \\(c\\), so they wouldn't contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) alone. Therefore, the coefficient is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part), which equals 120.\n\nWait, let me verify that again. In the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero is when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), so \\(m = 3\\). The coefficient for that term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So when we multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by this term, we get \\(20a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 * 20 = 120. That seems correct.\n\nSo, to recap, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 20. Multiplying these together gives 120, which is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product. I think that's the correct approach and answer.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by considering the binomial expansions of each part. \n\n1. In \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n2. In \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term with \\(c^0\\) (constant term) occurs when \\(m = 3\\), giving a coefficient of \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n3. Multiplying these coefficients together gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

Since the original problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), I think that the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) will be multiplied by the terms from \\((a + b)^4\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is independent of \\(c\\), the coefficient from the first part (6) will be multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part, but we need to consider if any terms in the second expansion would affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, actually, since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient from the second part should just be 1 because it's a constant term. But is that the case?\n\nWait, no. Let me think again. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So when you multiply these two, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), that would mean that the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because if you have \\(a^2b^2\\) times some power of \\(c\\), that would create a term with \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2/c^k\\), which isn't just \\(a^2b^2\\). So, to get the term \\(a^2b^2\\), it must be multiplied by the constant term in the second expansion.\n\nTherefore, I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let's compute that. Using the binomial theorem again, the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) will have terms of the form \\(\\binom{6}{k}c^{6 - k}\\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\binom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\\). The constant term occurs when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\binom{6}{3}\\), which is 20. So, the constant term is 20.\n\nNow, going back to the original expression, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) (which is 6) multiplied by the constant term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) (which is 20). So, 6 multiplied by 20 is 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120.\n\nWait, let me double-check that. So, \\((a + b)^4\\) gives 6 for \\(a^2b^2\\), and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) has a constant term of 20. Multiplying these together gives 120, which should be the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. That seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, another way to think about it is that since the two parts are multiplied together, the coefficients multiply as well for the terms that don't involve the other variables. So, yeah, 6 times 20 is 120. I think that's right.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break down the problem into two parts using the binomial theorem.\n\nFirst, consider the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\). Using the binomial theorem, the term with \\(a^2b^2\\) is given by:\n\\[\n\\binom{4}{2}a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\n\\]\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\nNext, consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). We need the constant term, which occurs when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. Using the binomial theorem, the general term is:\n\\[\n\\binom{6}{k}c^{6 - k}\\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\binom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\n\\]\nSetting the exponent equal to zero, we solve for \\(k\\):\n\\[\n6 - 2k = 0 \\implies k = 3\n\\]\nThe constant term is:\n\\[\n\\binom{6}{3} = 20\n\\]\n\nFinally, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficients from each part:\n\\[\n6 \\times 20 = 120\n\\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}."

    "text": " The binomial theorem says that \\((a + b)^n = \\sum_{k=0}^{n} \\dbinom{n}{k} a^{n - k} b^{k}\\). So, maybe I can use that here for the \\((a + b)^4\\) part.\n\nAlright, so for \\((a + b)^4\\), the expansion will have terms from \\(a^4\\) down to \\(b^4\\). The general term in the expansion is \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k} b^{k}\\) where \\(k\\) goes from 0 to 4. I'm specifically looking for the term where \\(a^2b^2\\), so that would be when \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). Let me check: if \\(4 - k = 2\\), then \\(k = 2\\), so yes, that's the term I need. The coefficient for that term would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\).\n\nCalculating \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\), which is \\(\\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6. But wait, the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), so I need to consider how that affects the coefficient.\n\nHmm, so the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\). But since the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), I need to consider whether the \\(c\\) terms will influence the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. Wait, actually, no. Because \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), so when we multiply the two expansions together, the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) will be multiplied by terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), we can ignore the \\(c\\) part because it doesn't affect the \\(a^2b^2\\) term's coefficient. Is that right?\n\nWait, no, maybe not. Because when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. So, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by every term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, I think that means we just need to consider the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, because when you multiply by the second part, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will be multiplied by 1 (if we consider the entire expression as a product, but actually, it's not just 1 because the second part has multiple terms). Wait, no, actually, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term is part of the product, but the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would just be the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the entire second part, because the second part is a separate variable. Wait, no, that doesn't make sense.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again. The expression is \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when you expand this, each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But since we're only asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, that means we need to find how many times \\(a^2b^2\\) appears in the product, considering all possible multiplications. But actually, since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), the \\(a^2b^2\\) term is only affected by the first part, and the second part doesn't influence the exponent of \\(a\\) or \\(b\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the entire second part, which is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, that doesn't make sense because the second part isn't a scalar; it's a polynomial in \\(c\\). So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, perhaps the problem is considering all terms, and the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). But that doesn't make much sense because \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by various powers of \\(c\\), so the coefficient would actually be a sum over all the terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by some power of \\(c\\). But that seems complicated. Alternatively, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, so the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\). But that seems unlikely because usually, when asking for a coefficient, you specify the terms in all variables.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where the exponents of \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are 2, 2, and 0, respectively. That would make sense because otherwise, the coefficient would involve \\(c\\) terms. So, maybe the problem is implicitly asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). Let me assume that for now.\n\nSo, to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), I need to consider the product of the two expansions: \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\), which we already found has a coefficient of 6. Now, we need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because when we multiply the two expansions, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) will be 6 multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion.\n\nSo, let's find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Again, using the binomial theorem, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\).\n\nWe need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be 0, so we set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\).\n\nCalculating \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\), which is \\(\\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire expression is the product of the two coefficients: 6 (from \\(a^2b^2\\)) and 20 (from \\(c^0\\)), so 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. So, in the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. In the second part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. So, when we multiply these two parts together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by the term \\(c^0\\) from the second part, giving \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) with coefficient 6 * 20 = 120. So, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem was just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without considering \\(c\\), then the answer would just be 6, but that seems unlikely because the entire expression includes \\(c\\) terms. So, I think the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nWait, but let me make sure. Another way to think about it is that when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each polynomial. So, in this case, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term is only from the first polynomial, and the \\(c^0\\) term is from the second polynomial. So, their product gives the term \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), and the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem was asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), that would mean summing over all possible \\(c\\) exponents, but that would be a different approach. But I think that's not the case here because usually, when asking for a specific coefficient, you specify all the exponents.\n\nWait, but let me consider that possibility. If the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which seems odd because the question is asking for a numerical coefficient. So, I think it's more likely that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nSo, to summarize, the steps are:\n\n1. Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is 6.\n\n2. Expand \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\), which is 20.\n\n3. Multiply these two coefficients together to get the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire expression, which is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplying it by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20. Thus, the final coefficient is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\boxed{120}"

    "text": " The same goes for \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), right?\n\nSo, starting with the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\). Using the binomial theorem, the expansion is the sum from \\(k = 0\\) to \\(4\\) of \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\\). I'm looking for the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2. That means \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\).\n\nLet me calculate that. \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) is \\(\\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). Okay, so the coefficient from the first part is 6.\n\nNow, moving on to the second part: \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I need to expand this as well. Using the binomial theorem again, the expansion is the sum from \\(m = 0\\) to \\(6\\) of \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying that, it becomes \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\).\n\nWait, so each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). Now, I'm supposed to multiply this by the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\), which has a term \\(6a^2b^2\\). But actually, when we multiply two polynomials, each term in the first polynomial multiplies each term in the second polynomial. However, since the second polynomial only involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), and the first polynomial only involves \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), the variables are different. So, the product will be a sum of terms where each term is a product of a term from the first expansion and a term from the second expansion.\n\nBut wait, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first part multiplied by each term in the second part. Since the second part is a polynomial in \\(c\\), each term will have a coefficient and a power of \\(c\\). However, the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). Wait, no, actually, I think I need to clarify that.\n\nWait, no, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but since the entire expression is a product of two polynomials, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term from the second polynomial. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would actually be the sum of the coefficients from each term in the second polynomial multiplied by the coefficient from the first part.\n\nWait, but that doesn't seem right because each term in the product would be something like \\(6a^2b^2 \\times \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by each term in the second polynomial, each with its own coefficient. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would actually be the sum of all the coefficients from the second polynomial multiplied by 6.\n\nBut wait, no, that's not correct because the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is just one term in the product. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients in the second polynomial. But that doesn't make sense because the second polynomial is in terms of \\(c\\), and the first is in terms of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). So, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this.\n\nWait, no, I think I'm misunderstanding the problem. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product. But since the second part is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which is separate from \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually be the coefficient from the first part, 6, multiplied by the entire second polynomial. But that can't be right because the second polynomial is a sum of terms, each with their own coefficients.\n\nWait, I think I'm getting confused here. Let me try to approach this differently. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When you expand this, each term in the expansion will be of the form \\( \\dbinom{4}{k}a^{4 - k}b^k \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - m}\\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m \\). Simplifying the second part, that becomes \\( \\dbinom{4}{k}\\dbinom{6}{m} a^{4 - k}b^k c^{6 - 2m} \\).\n\nNow, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, we need to find all terms where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2. That means \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). So, \\(k = 2\\), as I found earlier, and the coefficient from the first part is 6. Now, for each such term, the exponent of \\(c\\) will be \\(6 - 2m\\), but since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), I think we need to sum over all possible \\(m\\) the coefficients from the second part multiplied by 6.\n\nWait, but no, that's not quite right. Because each term in the product will have a specific power of \\(c\\), but the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the sum of all the coefficients from the second polynomial multiplied by 6.\n\nWait, but that can't be right because the second polynomial is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which when expanded has terms with different powers of \\(c\\). So, when we multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), each term will be \\(6 \\times \\dbinom{6}{m} a^2b^2 c^{6 - 2m}\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is actually 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in the second polynomial.\n\nBut wait, the sum of the coefficients in the second polynomial is found by setting \\(c = 1\\). So, substituting \\(c = 1\\), we get \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 \u00d7 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but that seems too straightforward. Let me check that again. If I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = (2)^6 = 64\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 \u00d7 64 = 384. Hmm, that seems correct, but I want to make sure I'm not missing anything.\n\nAlternatively, another way to think about it is that when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum of the products of the coefficients of terms that multiply to give that specific term. In this case, since \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial multiplied by each term in the second polynomial, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial, which is indeed 6 \u00d7 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me make sure that the second polynomial's coefficients sum to 64. Let me compute \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) at \\(c = 1\\): yes, that's \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of the coefficients is 64.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 \u00d7 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Is that the correct interpretation? Because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but in the product, each term is \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by a term from the second polynomial. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would indeed be the sum of all the coefficients from the second polynomial multiplied by 6.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem had asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some specific \\(k\\), then we would have to find the specific term where \\(6 - 2m = k\\), but since it's just \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), the coefficient is the sum over all possible \\(m\\) of the coefficients from the second polynomial multiplied by 6.\n\nSo, I think my initial conclusion is correct: the coefficient is 384.\n\nWait, but let me check with another approach. Let's compute the product step by step.\n\nFirst, \\((a + b)^4\\) expanded is:\n\n\\(a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\).\n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6.\n\nNow, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) can be expanded as:\n\n\\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\times (1/c)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\).\n\nSo, each term in this expansion is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\).\n\nNow, when we multiply the two expansions together, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, resulting in:\n\n\\(6a^2b^2 \\times \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\).\n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients from the second expansion. Since the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\).\n\nTherefore, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression is found by expanding each part separately and then considering the product. \n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\)**:\n   - The term with \\(a^2b^2\\) has a coefficient of \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n\n2. **Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)**:\n   - The sum of the coefficients is obtained by setting \\(c = 1\\), giving \\(2^6 = 64\\).\n\n3. **Multiply the coefficients**:\n   - The total coefficient is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\boxed{384}."

    "text": " The same goes for \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, the problem is asking specifically for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). That means I need to focus on the terms in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) that have \\(a^2b^2\\), and then see how it interacts with the other part of the expression.\n\nLet me start by expanding \\((a + b)^4\\). Using the binomial theorem, each term in the expansion is of the form \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}a^{4 - k}b^{k}\\) where \\(k\\) ranges from 0 to 4. So, the expansion would be:\n\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\dbinom{4}{0}a^4 + \\dbinom{4}{1}a^3b + \\dbinom{4}{2}a^2b^2 + \\dbinom{4}{3}ab^3 + \\dbinom{4}{4}b^4\n\\]\n\nCalculating the binomial coefficients:\n\n- \\(\\dbinom{4}{0} = 1\\)\n- \\(\\dbinom{4}{1} = 4\\)\n- \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\)\n- \\(\\dbinom{4}{3} = 4\\)\n- \\(\\dbinom{4}{4} = 1\\)\n\nSo, the expansion becomes:\n\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\n\\]\n\nGreat, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) here is 6. But wait, the original expression isn't just \\((a + b)^4\\); it's multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I need to consider the expansion of that part as well.\n\nLet me expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem. Each term will be \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - m}\\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the expansion is:\n\n\\[\n\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\n\\]\n\nCalculating the coefficients:\n\n- \\(\\dbinom{6}{0} = 1\\)\n- \\(\\dbinom{6}{1} = 6\\)\n- \\(\\dbinom{6}{2} = 15\\)\n- \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\)\n- \\(\\dbinom{6}{4} = 15\\)\n- \\(\\dbinom{6}{5} = 6\\)\n- \\(\\dbinom{6}{6} = 1\\)\n\nSo, the terms are:\n\n- \\(c^6\\)\n- \\(6c^{4}\\)\n- \\(15c^{2}\\)\n- \\(20c^{0} = 20\\)\n- \\(15c^{-2}\\)\n- \\(6c^{-4}\\)\n- \\(c^{-6}\\)\n\nBut wait, when I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I need to consider how this term interacts with the other part. However, since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), their exponents won't affect the exponents of \\(c\\). So, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think.\n\nWait, no, actually, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but in the entire expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when we multiply these two expansions together, each term from \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). However, since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), the exponents of \\(c\\) won't interfere with the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). Therefore, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion will be multiplied by every term in the second expansion, but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), we can treat the two expansions as separate and just multiply the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part by the entire second expansion. Wait, no, that doesn't make sense because we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). Hmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, but since \\(c\\) is separate, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, leading to terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), etc. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would include all the coefficients from the second expansion, because \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term. Wait, no, that's not correct. Let me clarify.\n\nWait, actually, no. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, when we expand this, each term from the first expansion is multiplied by each term from the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part (which has a coefficient of 6) is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, which has terms like \\(c^6\\), \\(6c^4\\), etc. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each of these, resulting in terms like \\(6a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(36a^2b^2c^4\\), and so on. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). Wait, no, that's not right either because \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term in the product, but it's multiplied by terms involving \\(c\\). So, actually, in the entire product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is actually the sum of all the coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by 6. Wait, that can't be right because the problem is probably asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, but considering all the terms, so the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion. But wait, the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion is when \\(c = 1\\), so \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 * 64 = 384. But that seems high. Alternatively, maybe I'm misinterpreting the problem.\n\nWait, no, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think again. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in one part (like \\(a^2b^2\\)) will be the product of its coefficient in the first polynomial and the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial. Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second polynomial, each term contributes to the overall coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times some power of \\(c\\). But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. Wait, no, that's not correct because in the product, each term will have both \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) exponents and \\(c\\) exponents. So, actually, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, leading to terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), etc. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would require that the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, because otherwise, it's not just \\(a^2b^2\\), but \\(a^2b^2c^k\\). So, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where \\(c\\) is raised to the zero power. That makes more sense.\n\nSo, in that case, I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), then multiply them together. Because when you multiply the two expansions, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part and \\(c^0\\) from the second part will combine to give \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), whose coefficient is the product of the two individual coefficients.\n\nSo, first, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, as we found earlier.\n\nNext, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). To find this, we can look at the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). The general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - m} \\times (1/c)^m = \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\). We need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be zero, so:\n\n\\(6 - 2m = 0\\)\n\nSolving for \\(m\\):\n\n\\(2m = 6\\)\n\n\\(m = 3\\)\n\nSo, the term where \\(m = 3\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}c^{0} = 20\\).\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20.\n\nNow, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire product is the product of the two coefficients: 6 (from \\(a^2b^2\\)) and 20 (from \\(c^0\\)), which is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nWait, but let me double-check. Is the problem asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), or specifically when \\(c\\) is to the zero power? If it's regardless of \\(c\\), then the coefficient would be 6 times the entire sum of coefficients in the second expansion, which is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). But that seems unlikely because the problem specifies \\(a^2b^2\\), which would typically mean without any \\(c\\) terms, i.e., \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). So, I think the correct approach is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nBut let me make sure. Let me consider the entire expression. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\), and it's multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, each term contributes to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times some power of \\(c\\). But if we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) exponents, then it's the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by 6.\n\nWait, but that would mean the coefficient is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion. The sum of the coefficients in the second expansion is when \\(c = 1\\), so \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). So, the coefficient would be \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). But I'm confused now because I thought earlier it was 120.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, meaning that we consider all possible powers of \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, giving 384. But that seems like a lot. Alternatively, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it's 6 times 20, which is 120.\n\nWait, the problem says: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" It doesn't specify any condition on \\(c\\), so perhaps it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). But in that case, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, so the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nBut wait, that doesn't seem right because in the product, each term would have both \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) exponents and \\(c\\) exponents. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would appear multiplied by each term in the second expansion, leading to terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), etc. So, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), without any restriction on \\(c\\), then it's 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, so 384.\n\nBut I'm not entirely sure. Let me think again. If I have two polynomials, P(a, b) and Q(c), then the coefficient of a certain term in P(a, b) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in Q(c) would give the coefficient of that term in P(a, b) times any term in Q(c). But in this case, Q(c) is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which has terms with positive and negative exponents. So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then it's 6 times the sum of all coefficients in Q(c). But the sum of coefficients in Q(c) is when c = 1, so \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). So, 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nBut wait, another way to think about it is that in the product, each term from P(a, b) is multiplied by each term from Q(c). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in P(a, b) is multiplied by each term in Q(c), leading to terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), etc. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the sum of all coefficients from Q(c) multiplied by 6. So, yes, that would be 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nBut now I'm confused because earlier I thought it was 120, considering only the \\(c^0\\) term. Let me see which interpretation is correct.\n\nLooking back at the problem: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" The way it's phrased, it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which could mean the coefficient regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, in that case, it's 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, so 384.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem had said \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\)\", then it would be 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nBut since it's just asking for \\(a^2b^2\\), without any condition on \\(c\\), I think it's 384.\n\nWait, but let me check with an example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Let's compute the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, no, in that case, \\((a + b)^2\\) has terms up to \\(a^2b^0\\), so \\(a^2b^2\\) isn't present. Let me take a different example.\n\nSuppose I have \\((a + b)^1 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). The coefficient of \\(a^1b^0\\) would be 1 times the sum of coefficients in the second expansion, which is 2. So, the coefficient of \\(a^1b^0\\) in the product is 2.\n\nSimilarly, in our problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, so 384.\n\nTherefore, I think the correct answer is 384.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was 120. Let me make sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, considering all possible \\(c\\) exponents. So, that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, so 384.\n\nBut let me think again: when you have two polynomials multiplied together, the coefficient of a term in one polynomial is the product of its coefficient and the sum of the coefficients in the other polynomial. So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, it's 6 times the sum of coefficients in the second polynomial.\n\nYes, that makes sense. Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second polynomial, each term contributes to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times some power of \\(c\\). So, the total coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) across all powers of \\(c\\) is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second polynomial.\n\nTherefore, the sum of coefficients in the second polynomial is \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). So, 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me confirm this with a small example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^1 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). The expansion is \\((a + b)(c + 1/c)\\). The coefficient of \\(a\\) is 1 times the sum of coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 2. So, the coefficient of \\(a\\) in the product is 2, which is correct because the terms are \\(ac\\), \\(a/c\\), \\(bc\\), \\(b/c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a\\) is indeed 2.\n\nSimilarly, in our problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times 64, which is 384.\n\nBut wait, I'm now doubting myself because earlier I thought it was 120. Let me check again.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where \\(a\\) is squared, \\(b\\) is squared, and \\(c\\) is to the zero power. In that case, the coefficient would be 6 (from \\(a^2b^2\\)) times 20 (from \\(c^0\\)), which is 120.\n\nBut the problem doesn't specify \\(c^0\\), just \\(a^2b^2\\). So, perhaps the answer is 384.\n\nWait, let me think about how the product works. When you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), etc. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the sum of all these coefficients, which is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, giving 384.\n\nBut wait, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) exponent, then it's 384. If it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), it's 120.\n\nSince the problem doesn't specify \\(c^0\\), I think the correct interpretation is that it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), which would be 384.\n\nBut I'm still a bit unsure. Let me check the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" It doesn't mention \\(c\\), so perhaps it's considering the entire expression as a polynomial in \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\), and \\(1/c\\), and it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would include all the possible \\(c\\) exponents. Therefore, the coefficient is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, so 384.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is only considering the term where \\(c\\) is raised to the zero power, in which case it's 120. But without more context, it's hard to say. However, in standard problems like this, when they ask for the coefficient of a term without specifying other variables, they usually mean the coefficient when considering all possible exponents of the other variables. So, I think 384 is the correct answer.\n\nWait, but let me think again. If the problem had asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), it would have specified. Since it's just \\(a^2b^2\\), perhaps it's considering the term without any \\(c\\) factors, meaning \\(c^0\\). So, in that case, it's 6 times 20, which is 120.\n\nBut I'm now more confused because I don't know the exact intention of the problem. Let me try to find a source or a similar problem.\n\nWait, perhaps I can think about the problem differently. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). If I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and when multiplied by 64, gives 384. So, if I set \\(c = 1\\), the entire expression becomes \\((a + b)^4 \\times 64\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, if I set \\(c\\) such that \\(c^k = 1\\), but that's not necessary here.\n\nSo, I think the correct answer is 384.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was 120. I need to resolve this confusion.\n\nLet me consider that when you have two polynomials multiplied together, the coefficient of a specific term in one polynomial is the product of its coefficient and the sum of the coefficients in the other polynomial. So, in this case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial is 6, and the sum of the coefficients in the second polynomial is 64, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nYes, that makes sense because when you expand the product, every term in the second polynomial is multiplied by every term in the first polynomial, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by considering the binomial expansions of each part. \n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\)**:\n   - The term \\(a^2b^2\\) has a coefficient of 6.\n\n2. **Sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)**:\n   - The sum of the coefficients is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), resulting in \\(2^6 = 64\\).\n\n3. **Multiply the coefficients**:\n   - The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{384}\n\\]"

So maybe I don't need to worry about the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\). Let me think about that.\n\nSo, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), that term comes only from the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\), correct? Because \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) are separate variables, and their expansion won't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms.

Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem.\n\nWait, no, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, in other words, we need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, considering all possible terms, but since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are separate variables, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be the product of the coefficients from each part.

But the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so perhaps I'm overcomplicating this.\n\nWait, no, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. Maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, but since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient would just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't make sense because the coefficient should be a numerical value, not a polynomial. Hmm, maybe I need to approach this differently.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me try to break it down.\n\nFirst, let's consider \\((a + b)^4\\). Using the binomial theorem, the expansion is:\n\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\binom{4}{k} a^{4 - k} b^k\n\\]\n\nSo, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) occurs when \\(4 - k = 2\\), which means \\(k = 2\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(\\binom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n\nNow, the other part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let's expand this using the binomial theorem as well:\n\n\\[\n\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\binom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\binom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n\\]\n\nSo, each term in this expansion is \\(\\binom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\) for \\(m = 0\\) to \\(6\\).\n\nNow, when we multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the product is:\n\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\left(\\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\binom{4}{k} a^{4 - k} b^k\\right) \\left(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\binom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\right)\n\\]\n\nNow, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). From the first part, we know that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, as we found earlier. But when we multiply by the second expansion, each term in the first sum is multiplied by each term in the second sum. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 multiplied by the entire second sum, which is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is \\(6 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But that can't be right because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, not a polynomial.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. That would make sense because then we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), which is just a numerical coefficient. Let me check that.\n\nIf that's the case, then in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero is when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which gives \\(m = 3\\). So, the coefficient for that term is \\(\\binom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, considering only the terms where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, would be the product of the coefficients from each part, which is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nWait, but the problem didn't specify anything about \\(c\\), just \\(a^2b^2\\). So, maybe I was correct initially that the coefficient is just 6, but that seems too simple. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which would mean that the coefficient is 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but that would make the coefficient a polynomial, which doesn't seem right. So, perhaps the problem is indeed asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be 120.\n\nWait, let me think again. The problem is stated as: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\).\" So, it's possible that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). But in that case, the coefficient would be a sum over all possible exponents of \\(c\\), which would make it a polynomial in \\(c\\), but that seems unlikely because the problem is asking for a coefficient, which is typically a number.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, treating \\(c\\) as a variable, but that would mean that the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which again doesn't make sense because the problem is likely expecting a numerical value.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me go back.\n\nThe expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, when you multiply these two expressions, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is \\(6 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't seem right because the problem is asking for a coefficient, which is a number.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, but without considering \\(c\\), meaning that it's just the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and the other part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), is irrelevant because it doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. But that seems incorrect because when you multiply two polynomials, each term in one affects all terms in the other.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is miswritten, and it's supposed to be \\((a + b + c + 1/c)^4\\) or something else, but as it is, I have to work with \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\).\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, considering all possible terms, but since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are separate variables, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the same as the coefficient in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which would make the coefficient a sum involving \\(c\\). But that doesn't make sense because the problem is expecting a numerical coefficient.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me think differently. Perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, but since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient would just be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the problem is expecting a numerical value.\n\nWait, maybe I'm missing something. Let me check the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\).\" Hmm, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the sum over all terms in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which would be 6 times \\(2^6 = 64\\), but that's not correct because \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) isn't a constant; it's a sum of terms with different powers of \\(c\\).\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is expecting just the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and the rest is irrelevant. But that seems too simple, and the problem includes both \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), so it's likely that both parts contribute to the coefficient.\n\nWait, maybe I need to consider that when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficients multiply. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by \\(c^0\\), you get \\(a^2b^2\\), which is the term we're interested in. So, that makes sense.\n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\binom{6}{3} = 20\\), because as I calculated earlier, when \\(m = 3\\), the exponent of \\(c\\) is \\(6 - 2*3 = 0\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nWait, that seems plausible. So, to recap:\n\n1. Find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\): that's 6.\n2. Find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\): that's 20.\n3. Multiply them together to get the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product: 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So, the final answer should be 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is found using the binomial theorem: \\(\\binom{4}{2} = 6\\). For the term \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the coefficient is \\(\\binom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying these gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}."

So, for \\((a + b)^4\\), I can write this as \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\\).\n\nNow, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). That means I need to find the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2. So, in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\), I should look for the term where \\(a^{4 - k}b^k\\) becomes \\(a^2b^2\\). \n\nLet me set up the equation: \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). Solving for \\(k\\), I subtract 2 from both sides: \\(4 - 2 = k\\), so \\(k = 2\\). That means the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). \n\nCalculating that, \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) part is 6.\n\nNow, the other part of the expression is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I need to figure out how this part affects the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, actually, since the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms are in the first part, and \\(c\\) is in the second part, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term doesn't involve \\(c\\) at all. So, the coefficient from the second part should be the entire expansion, but since we're only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), maybe I just need to consider the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) because \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term without \\(c\\).\n\nWait, let me think again. The expression is the product of two expansions: \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when we multiply them together, each term in the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), we need to find the term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) that is a constant, i.e., \\(c^0\\), because when we multiply it by \\(a^2b^2\\), it won't affect the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). \n\nSo, I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). \n\nWe want the exponent of \\(c\\) to be zero, so set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). \n\nCalculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20.\n\nNow, putting it all together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficient from the first part and the constant term from the second part. So, that's 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the second part). \n\nCalculating that, 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nWait, but let me double-check that. So, the first part gives 6 for \\(a^2b^2\\), and the second part gives 20 for the constant term. When you multiply these together, it's 6 * 20 = 120. So, the coefficient should be 120.\n\nHmm, does that make sense? Let me think if there's another way to approach this. Alternatively, maybe I can consider the entire expansion as a product and see how the terms combine, but I think the approach I took is correct because \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), so the only way it can come up is if we multiply it by a constant term from the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient should indeed be 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nSo, I think I'm confident that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem.\n\nFirst, consider the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n\\]\nWe need the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2.

But that doesn't make sense because the sum of all terms in the second expansion would just be a constant, which would then multiply the coefficient from the first part.\n\nWait, no, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me try to approach this step by step.\n\nFirst, let's consider \\((a + b)^4\\). Using the binomial theorem, the expansion is:\n\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\binom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n\\]\n\nSo the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is when \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\), so the coefficient is \\(\\binom{4}{2}\\), which is 6.\n\nNow, the other part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let's expand this using the binomial theorem as well:\n\n\\[\n\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\binom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\binom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n\\]\n\nSo each term in this expansion is \\(\\binom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\).\n\nNow, when we multiply the two expansions together, each term from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term from the second expansion. So the product is:\n\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\left(\\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\binom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\\right) \\times \\left(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\binom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\right)\n\\]\n\nNow, when we multiply these two sums, each term will be of the form \\(\\binom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k \\times \\binom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\).\n\nBut the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So we need to find all terms in the product where the powers of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2 and 2, respectively. That is, \\(a^2b^2\\).\n\nLooking at the first expansion, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\(k = 2\\), as we determined earlier, with coefficient \\(\\binom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n\nNow, when we multiply this term by each term in the second expansion, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product will be 6 multiplied by the sum of all terms in the second expansion. Wait, no, that can't be right because the second expansion has terms in \\(c\\), which are separate from \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). So actually, when we multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, each of those products will have a term \\(a^2b^2c^{6 - 2m}\\) for each \\(m\\). But the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would be the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part, because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, each of those will contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, but only if we're considering the product as a polynomial in \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\). Wait, no, that doesn't make sense because \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), so when you multiply it by each term in the second expansion, each of those will be separate terms involving \\(c\\), but the term \\(a^2b^2\\) itself would only appear when multiplied by the constant term in the second expansion, which is when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion.\n\nWait, that makes more sense. Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, only the term where \\(c^0\\) (i.e., the constant term) will result in a term that is just \\(a^2b^2\\), without any \\(c\\) terms. All other terms will have \\(c\\) raised to some power, so they won't contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) alone.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is equal to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nSo first, let's find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which we already found to be 6.\n\nNext, let's find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). From the expansion earlier, we have:\n\n\\[\n\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\binom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n\\]\n\nWe want the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so we set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which gives \\(m = 3\\).\n\nTherefore, the coefficient is \\(\\binom{6}{3}\\), which is 20.\n\nNow, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the second part), which equals 120.\n\nWait, but let me double-check that. So, in the first expansion, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) has a coefficient of 6. In the second expansion, the term \\(c^0\\) has a coefficient of 20. When we multiply these two, we get 6 * 20 = 120. So the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 120.\n\nBut let me make sure I didn't make a mistake. Another way to think about it is that when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each polynomial, provided that the variables match appropriately. In this case, since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are only in the first polynomial, the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is by multiplying the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first polynomial by the constant term (i.e., \\(c^0\\)) from the second polynomial. So yes, that would be 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nAlternatively, if I consider the entire product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would come from all possible combinations where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any term from the second expansion, but since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the only way it can appear in the product is when it's multiplied by a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), which is only the constant term. So yes, that confirms it.\n\nWait, but another thought: Maybe I'm supposed to consider all possible terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any term from the second expansion, but since \\(a^2b^2\\) is separate from \\(c\\), the coefficient would just be the product of the coefficients, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. But that's not quite right because each term in the product would be \\(a^2b^2c^{6 - 2m}\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the sum over all \\(m\\) of \\(\\binom{4}{2} \\times \\binom{6}{m}\\) where \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Wait, no, that's not correct because \\(6 - 2m = 0\\) only when \\(m = 3\\), so that's the only term contributing to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So yes, the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but another way to think about it: The entire product is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So when you expand this, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that's not correct because the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) would be when you set \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\(2^6 = 64\\). So then, the coefficient would be 6 * 64 = 384. But that contradicts my earlier result of 120. Hmm, so which one is correct?\n\nWait, no, that approach is wrong because when you set \\(c = 1\\), you're effectively summing all the coefficients, but in the product, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So if you set \\(c = 1\\), you get the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, but that would give you the total sum of coefficients in the product, not just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So that approach isn't helpful here.\n\nWait, so going back, I think the correct approach is that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is equal to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but let me confirm by actually expanding both parts.\n\nFirst, \\((a + b)^4\\) has terms:\n\n- \\(a^4\\), coefficient 1\n- \\(4a^3b\\), coefficient 4\n- \\(6a^2b^2\\), coefficient 6\n- \\(4ab^3\\), coefficient 4\n- \\(b^4\\), coefficient 1\n\nNow, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) has terms:\n\nFor \\(m = 0\\): \\(\\binom{6}{0}c^6 = 1 \\times c^6\\)\nFor \\(m = 1\\): \\(\\binom{6}{1}c^4 = 6c^4\\)\nFor \\(m = 2\\): \\(\\binom{6}{2}c^2 = 15c^2\\)\nFor \\(m = 3\\): \\(\\binom{6}{3}c^0 = 20\\)\nFor \\(m = 4\\): \\(\\binom{6}{4}c^{-2} = 15c^{-2}\\)\nFor \\(m = 5\\): \\(\\binom{6}{5}c^{-4} = 6c^{-4}\\)\nFor \\(m = 6\\): \\(\\binom{6}{6}c^{-6} = 1c^{-6}\\)\n\nSo the constant term is 20.\n\nNow, when we multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in the first will multiply each term in the second. So the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first will multiply each term in the second, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), \\(a^2b^2c^2\\), \\(a^2b^2\\), \\(a^2b^2c^{-2}\\), etc.\n\nBut the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0. So only when the second term is \\(c^0\\), which has coefficient 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So the final answer is 120.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me think if there's another way this could be approached. Maybe using generating functions or considering the product as a whole. But I think the approach I took is correct. The key insight is that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the product of the coefficients of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and the constant term in the second part. So 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nI think that's solid. So I'm confident the answer is 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem for both parts of the expression.\n\nFirst, consider the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\binom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n\\]\nThe term \\(a^2b^2\\) occurs when \\(k = 2\\), so the coefficient is:\n\\[\n\\binom{4}{2} = 6\n\\]\n\nNext, consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem:\n\\[\n\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\binom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n\\]\nWe need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, which occurs when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), giving \\(m = 3\\). The coefficient is:\n\\[\n\\binom{6}{3} = 20\n\\]\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is the product of the coefficients from each expansion:\n\\[\n6 \\times 20 = 120\n\\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

    "text": " Similarly, the other part \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) can also be expanded using the binomial theorem. But wait, the problem is only asking about the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is part of the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\). So maybe I don't need to worry about the second part when looking for \\(a^2b^2\\), but I'm not entirely sure yet. Let me think.\n\nAlright, so let me break it down. The entire expression is the product of two binomials raised to powers: \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Since these are multiplied together, the expansion will involve terms from both expansions multiplied by each other. But the term \\(a^2b^2\\) only comes from the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), right? Because the second part involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), so those terms wouldn't contribute to \\(a\\) or \\(b\\). So maybe I can just find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and then multiply it by the entire expansion of the second part, but that doesn't make sense because the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not multiplied by anything else. Wait, no, actually, when you multiply two expressions together, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression. So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I need to consider that term from the first part and then multiply it by the entire second part, but since the second part doesn't have \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), maybe the coefficient just comes from the first part. Hmm, I'm getting confused.\n\nLet me try another approach. Let's first expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem. The binomial theorem says that \\((a + b)^n = \\sum_{k=0}^{n} \\dbinom{n}{k} a^{n - k}b^k\\). So for \\(n = 4\\), the expansion is \\(\\dbinom{4}{0}a^4b^0 + \\dbinom{4}{1}a^3b^1 + \\dbinom{4}{2}a^2b^2 + \\dbinom{4}{3}a^1b^3 + \\dbinom{4}{4}a^0b^4\\). So the term with \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}a^2b^2\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\), so that term is \\(6a^2b^2\\).\n\nNow, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So when we multiply these two, each term from the first expansion gets multiplied by each term from the second expansion. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), we can consider the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) from the first part and then multiply it by the entire expansion of the second part. However, that would mean the coefficient is \\(6 \\times\\) the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term in the entire product, but in reality, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by various terms from the second expansion. Wait, no, actually, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) itself is just a term in the product, and it's multiplied by all the terms from the second expansion. So the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be \\(6 \\times\\) the sum of all the coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that can't be right because that would make the coefficient a very large number, and I don't think that's what the problem is asking.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but in the entire product, each term is a combination of terms from both expansions. So, for example, \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part would be multiplied by \\(c^6\\) from the second part, or \\(c^5 \\times \\dfrac{1}{c}\\), and so on. But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\), I think that the coefficient would just be \\(6\\) multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients from the second expansion. But that doesn't seem right either because the problem is likely expecting a numerical coefficient, not a polynomial.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, considering all possible terms, but that would mean that the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by different powers of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), but since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the same regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, in other words, the coefficient would just be \\(6\\) times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But let me check that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and since the second part doesn't affect \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), the coefficient remains 6. But I'm not sure because the problem includes both parts multiplied together, so perhaps I need to consider that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 times the entire expansion of the second part, but that would make the coefficient a polynomial, which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and the second part is just a distraction. But that seems unlikely because the problem includes both parts. Maybe I should consider that the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), and when you multiply these, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term from the second expansion, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in the second expansion.\n\nWait, but the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\). So, let's calculate that. The sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So then, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). Is that correct?\n\nWait, but that seems too straightforward. Let me think again. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes with a coefficient of 6 from the first part, and the second part, when expanded, has various terms. But when you multiply \\(6a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, each of those products will have a term like \\(6a^2b^2c^k\\) where \\(k\\) ranges from -6 to 6 in steps of 2, I think. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so regardless of the powers of \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients in the second expansion. Because each term in the second expansion, when multiplied by \\(6a^2b^2\\), would contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times that term's coefficient. So, yes, the total coefficient would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, so 6*64=384.\n\nBut wait, let me confirm. The sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is indeed \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\), as I thought. So, each term in the second expansion has a coefficient, and when multiplied by \\(6a^2b^2\\), each of those terms contributes to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. So, the total coefficient would be 6 times 64, which is 384.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of it as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) being 6, and since the second expansion has 64 as the sum of its coefficients, the total coefficient is 6*64=384.\n\nWait, but I'm not sure if that's the correct approach. Maybe I should instead consider that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is just 6, because the second part doesn't affect \\(a\\) or \\(b\\). But that seems contradictory because the second part is being multiplied, so it should affect the overall coefficient.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Let me consider that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, which means that term \\(a^2b^2\\) is present in the first part, and when multiplied by the second part, which is a series in \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in the second expansion. Because each term in the second expansion, when multiplied by \\(6a^2b^2\\), would result in a term like \\(6a^2b^2c^k\\), but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), the coefficient would be the sum of all the coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by 6.\n\nSo, sum of coefficients in the second part is 64, so 6*64=384. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 384.\n\nWait, but let me check this with another approach. Let's consider the entire product:\n\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\left(\\sum_{k=0}^4 \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\\right) \\times \\left(\\sum_{m=0}^6 \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\right)\n\\]\n\nSimplifying the second sum:\n\n\\[\n\\sum_{m=0}^6 \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n\\]\n\nSo, the entire product is:\n\n\\[\n\\sum_{k=0}^4 \\sum_{m=0}^6 \\dbinom{4}{k} \\dbinom{6}{m} a^{4 - k}b^k c^{6 - 2m}\n\\]\n\nNow, we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, set \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\), which gives \\(k=2\\). So, the coefficient from the first sum is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Now, the term from the second sum is \\(c^{6 - 2m}\\), but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the sum over all \\(m\\) of \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\), because each term in the second sum contributes its coefficient when multiplied by \\(6a^2b^2\\). So, the total coefficient is \\(6 \\times \\sum_{m=0}^6 \\dbinom{6}{m}\\).\n\nBut \\(\\sum_{m=0}^6 \\dbinom{6}{m} = 2^6 = 64\\), so the total coefficient is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\nYes, that makes sense. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 384.\n\nWait, but let me confirm once more. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\(k=2\\) in the first expansion, and then for each \\(m\\) in the second expansion, the term is multiplied by \\(6 \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}\\). So, the total coefficient is \\(6 \\times \\sum_{m=0}^6 \\dbinom{6}{m} = 6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is found using the binomial coefficient \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). When multiplied by the sum of the coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is \\(2^6 = 64\\), the total coefficient becomes \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{384}."

    "text": " The same goes for \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, the question is specifically asking about the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). That term comes from the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\), right? So maybe I don't need to worry about the other part involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) because \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't have any \\(c\\) terms. Let me think about that.\n\nOkay, so the expression is the product of two separate binomial expansions: one involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the other involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). Since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), maybe the coefficient from the first part is independent of the second part. That is, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, that doesn't quite make sense because when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first polynomial gets multiplied by each term in the second. But since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term without \\(c\\), perhaps when we multiply it by terms from the second expansion, we need to consider how they interact. Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating this.\n\nWait, perhaps I should treat the two parts separately. Since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term from \\((a + b)^4\\), and the other part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), maybe the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems odd because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which should be a coefficient without any \\(c\\) terms. So maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem.\n\nWait, no, perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So in other words, when you multiply out the entire expression, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by various powers of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), but the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) itself would be the sum of all the coefficients from the \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) expansion multiplied by the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) for \\(a^2b^2\\). So that makes sense because when you multiply two polynomials, each term in one is multiplied by each term in the other, so the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Wait, but the sum of all coefficients in the second part would be when \\(c = 1\\), right? Because substituting \\(c = 1\\) into \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) gives the sum of all coefficients, which is \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So then, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be the coefficient from the first part times 64.\n\nBut let me verify that. So, first, let me find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\). Using the binomial theorem, the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{k}b^{4 - k}\\). So the term where \\(k = 2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}a^2b^2\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\), so the coefficient is 6.\n\nNow, for the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The sum of all coefficients in this expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), so substituting \\(c = 1\\) gives \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, when we multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\nWait, but let me think again. Is that correct? Because when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each polynomial. But in this case, \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term from the first polynomial, and any term from the second polynomial will have some power of \\(c\\). So when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by, say, \\(c^3\\), you get \\(a^2b^2c^3\\), which is a different term. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part, because each term in the second part contributes a multiple of \\(a^2b^2\\).\n\nWait, that makes sense. So, for example, if I have \\( (a + b)^4 = 6a^2b^2 + \\text{other terms} \\) and \\( \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = 64 + \\text{other terms involving } c \\), then when I multiply them together, the \\(6a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\), as I thought earlier.\n\nWait, but let me check with a small example to make sure. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). So \\((a + b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2\\), and \\((c + 1/c)^1 = c + 1/c\\). Now, if I multiply them, the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) would be 1 times (c + 1/c), so the term is \\(a^2c + a^2/c\\). So the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) in the product is (1)(1) for the \\(a^2\\) term, but since we're considering the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, it's actually the sum of the coefficients from the second polynomial, which is \\(1 + 1 = 2\\). So the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) in the product would be 1 * 2 = 2. Similarly, the coefficient of \\(ab\\) would be 2 * 2 = 4, and the coefficient of \\(b^2\\) would be 1 * 2 = 2. That seems to check out.\n\nSo applying that logic to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 64, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but I should also consider whether there are any other terms that might contribute to \\(a^2b^2\\). For instance, could there be terms from the second expansion that, when multiplied by other terms from the first expansion, result in \\(a^2b^2\\)? But no, because \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term from the first expansion, and the second expansion only has terms with \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), which are separate variables. So when you multiply, each term from the first expansion is multiplied by each term from the second expansion, but \\(a^2b^2\\) can only come from the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first expansion multiplied by any term from the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient is indeed 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, another way to think about it is that the entire expression is a product of two polynomials, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the coefficient in the first polynomial times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial. Since the second polynomial's sum of coefficients is 64, as we found earlier, that gives us 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me just confirm that the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is indeed 64. To find the sum of coefficients, we can substitute \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So that's correct.\n\nTherefore, putting it all together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is 384.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{384}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break down the problem into two parts:\n\n1. **Finding the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\):**\n   Using the binomial theorem, the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is given by:\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\binom{4}{k} a^k b^{4-k}\n   \\]\n   The term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\), so the coefficient is:\n   \\[\n   \\binom{4}{2} = 6\n   \\]\n\n2. **Finding the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   The sum of the coefficients in a polynomial is found by substituting \\(c = 1\\).

So, maybe I can apply that here.\n\nLet me start by looking at the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\). Using the binomial theorem, the expansion of this would be:\n\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\dbinom{4}{0}a^4b^0 + \\dbinom{4}{1}a^3b^1 + \\dbinom{4}{2}a^2b^2 + \\dbinom{4}{3}a^1b^3 + \\dbinom{4}{4}a^0b^4\n\\]\n\nCalculating the binomial coefficients, that would be:\n\n- \\(\\dbinom{4}{0} = 1\\)\n- \\(\\dbinom{4}{1} = 4\\)\n- \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\)\n- \\(\\dbinom{4}{3} = 4\\)\n- \\(\\dbinom{4}{4} = 1\\)\n\nSo, the expansion is:\n\n\\[\n1 \\cdot a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + 1 \\cdot b^4\n\\]\n\nAlright, so in this expansion, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. That's straightforward.\n\nNow, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I think I need to consider how the terms from \\((a + b)^4\\) interact with the terms from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nWait, but hold on. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) is only from \\((a + b)^4\\), right? Because when you multiply two expressions together, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression. So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), that term doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\). So, does that mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is just the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\)? Because when you multiply by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which only affects the terms with \\(c\\), the \\(a^2b^2\\) term would be multiplied by every term in the second expansion, but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), the other factors must contribute a constant term.\n\nWait, that might not be correct. Let me think again. When you multiply two polynomials, each term from the first polynomial is multiplied by each term from the second. So, if I have a term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, it will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, which are powers of \\(c\\). But since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms is if the second factor contributes a term that is \\(c^0\\), which is 1. So, I think I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero.\n\nLet me check that. So, if I expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), using the binomial theorem again, it would be:\n\n\\[\n\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n\\]\n\nSo, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). The exponent on \\(c\\) is \\(6 - 2k\\). I need the exponent to be zero because I'm looking for the constant term. So, let's set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\):\n\n\\[\n6 - 2k = 0 \\implies 2k = 6 \\implies k = 3\n\\]\n\nSo, the constant term is when \\(k = 3\\). The coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\), which is 20. So, the constant term is 20.\n\nTherefore, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by 20 from the second part. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 (from the first expansion) multiplied by 20 (from the second expansion).\n\nWait, but hold on. Let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\) as 6, and then when I multiply by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which has a constant term 20. So, the total coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 * 20 = 120. Is that correct?\n\nWait, but let me think again. When I multiply two polynomials, the coefficients multiply. So, if I have \\( (P(a, b)) \\times (Q(c)) \\), then each term in \\(P(a, b)\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(Q(c)\\). So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), that term in \\(P(a, b)\\) is 6, and in \\(Q(c)\\), the term that doesn't affect \\(a\\) or \\(b\\) is the constant term, which is 20. So, when I multiply these together, the coefficient becomes 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but is there any other term in \\(Q(c)\\) that could contribute to \\(a^2b^2\\)? No, because \\(Q(c)\\) only involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), so when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), it's just scaling that term by the coefficients from \\(Q(c)\\). So, the only way \\(a^2b^2\\) remains as \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms is if it's multiplied by the constant term in \\(Q(c)\\), which is 20. Therefore, the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't miss anything. Let's consider the entire product:\n\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\left( \\text{terms involving } a \\text{ and } b \\right) \\times \\left( \\text{terms involving } c \\right)\n\\]\n\nSo, when I multiply these together, each term from the first part is multiplied by each term from the second part. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by every term in the second expansion. But when considering the overall expression, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), that would include all the terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by a term in the second expansion that doesn't affect \\(a\\) or \\(b\\). But since the second expansion only involves \\(c\\), the only way \\(a^2b^2\\) remains as \\(a^2b^2\\) is if it's multiplied by the constant term in the second expansion, which is 20. Therefore, the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but let me check if I'm not overcomplicating this. Another way to think about it is that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the product of the coefficients of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and the constant term in the second part. So, yes, 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nAlternatively, I could think of it as the entire product being equal to:\n\n\\[\n\\sum_{i=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{i} a^{4 - i} b^i \\times \\sum_{j=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{j} c^{6 - 2j}\n\\]\n\nSo, when multiplying these two sums, each term is \\(\\dbinom{4}{i} \\dbinom{6}{j} a^{4 - i} b^i c^{6 - 2j}\\). Now, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), that means I need \\(4 - i = 2\\) and \\(i = 2\\). So, \\(i = 2\\), which gives \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Then, for the exponent of \\(c\\), since we're looking for terms where \\(c^0\\), we need \\(6 - 2j = 0\\), which gives \\(j = 3\\), as before. So, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because sometimes when you multiply two polynomials, the variables can interact, but in this case, since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), the exponents don't interfere. So, I think my reasoning is correct.\n\nLet me recap:\n\n1. Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is 6.\n\n2. Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem to find the constant term, which is when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, which happens at \\(k = 3\\), giving a coefficient of 20.\n\n3. Multiply these two coefficients together to get the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, which is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nI think that makes sense. Let me just check if I've made any miscalculations.\n\nCalculating \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\): 4! / (2! * 2!) = (24)/(2 * 2) = 24/4 = 6. Correct.\n\nCalculating \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\): 6! / (3! * 3!) = (720)/(6 * 6) = 720/36 = 20. Correct.\n\nSo, 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Is there any other term in the second expansion that could contribute to \\(a^2b^2\\)? For example, if there was a term with \\(c^0\\), that's the only one that would multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) without introducing any \\(c\\) terms. So, I think that's the only contribution. Therefore, 120 is the correct coefficient.\n\nI think I've considered all the steps and checked my work, so I'm confident that the coefficient is 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem for both parts of the expression.\n\nFirst, we expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k} b^k\n\\]\nThe term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\), so the coefficient is:\n\\[\n\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\n\\]\n\nNext, we expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem:\n\\[\n\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n\\]\nWe need the constant term (where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero). Setting \\(6 - 2k = 0\\) gives \\(k = 3\\). The coefficient is:\n\\[\n\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\n\\]\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficients from each part:\n\\[\n6 \\times 20 = 120\n\\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

    "text": " The binomial theorem says that \\((a + b)^n = \\sum_{k=0}^{n} \\dbinom{n}{k} a^{n - k} b^k\\). So, maybe I can apply that here.\n\nLooking at \\((a + b)^4\\), I can expand this part first. Let me write out the expansion. The general term will be \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k} b^k\\), where \\(k\\) goes from 0 to 4. So, the expansion would be:\n\n\\[\n\\dbinom{4}{0}a^4b^0 + \\dbinom{4}{1}a^3b^1 + \\dbinom{4}{2}a^2b^2 + \\dbinom{4}{3}a^1b^3 + \\dbinom{4}{4}a^0b^4\n\\]\n\nCalculating the coefficients, that's:\n\n\\[\n1 \\cdot a^4 + 4 \\cdot a^3b + 6 \\cdot a^2b^2 + 4 \\cdot ab^3 + 1 \\cdot b^4\n\\]\n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. But wait, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, which is \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nHmm, so I need to consider how multiplying by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) affects the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Let me think. When I multiply two polynomials, the coefficients multiply term by term. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion will be multiplied by every term from the second expansion \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, no, actually, when you multiply two polynomials, each term from the first is multiplied by each term from the second, but the variables are also multiplied. However, in this case, the variables in the first part are \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), while in the second part, they are \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). Since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are different variables, their exponents don't interfere with each other. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product will just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire second expansion, because the second expansion doesn't contain \\(a\\) or \\(b\\) at all. \n\nWait, is that right? Let me double-check. The first part is \\((a + b)^4\\), which only has terms with \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the second part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which only has terms with \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So when you multiply them together, each term from the first expansion is multiplied by each term from the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by every term from the second part, which are powers of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression will be the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients in the second part. Because each term in the second part will multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term, contributing their coefficients to the overall coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\).\n\nWait, no, that's not quite right. Let me think again. When you multiply two expressions, say \\(P(a, b)\\) and \\(Q(c)\\), then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\(P(a, b) \\cdot Q(c)\\) is just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(P(a, b)\\) multiplied by the entire \\(Q(c)\\), because \\(Q(c)\\) doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. But actually, when you multiply, each term in \\(P(a, b)\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(Q(c)\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(P(a, b)\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(Q(c)\\). Because each term in \\(Q(c)\\) contributes its coefficient to the multiplication with \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nWait, but \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is a Laurent polynomial, meaning it can have negative exponents as well. So, when we talk about the sum of its coefficients, we usually consider substituting \\(c = 1\\), because that makes each term equal to its coefficient. So, if I substitute \\(c = 1\\) into \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), I get \\((1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the sum of the coefficients in the second part is 64. \n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 64 (the sum of coefficients in the second part), which gives 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. Is it correct to just multiply the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) by the sum of the coefficients of the second polynomial? Let me think about a simpler case. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^1 \\cdot (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, expanding, it's \\((a + b)(c + 1/c)\\). The coefficient of \\(a\\) would be 1 (from \\(a\\)) multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. So, the coefficient of \\(a\\) in the product is \\(c + 1/c\\), which is not just 1 multiplied by the sum of coefficients of the second polynomial. Wait, that contradicts my earlier conclusion. So maybe my approach is wrong.\n\nWait, no, in that case, the coefficient of \\(a\\) in the product is actually the same as the coefficient of \\(a\\) in the first polynomial times the entire second polynomial, but when considering coefficients, we usually look for specific terms. Wait, maybe I'm confusing the concepts here.\n\nLet me clarify: when we're looking for the coefficient of a specific term, say \\(a^2b^2\\), in the product of two polynomials, we need to consider how the variables interact. In this case, since the second polynomial only involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), and the first polynomial only involves \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), the variables are independent. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is simply the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial times the entire second polynomial, because the second polynomial doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) variables. \n\nBut wait, that doesn't make sense because the second polynomial is a separate entity. Let me think differently. When you multiply two polynomials, each term from the first is multiplied by each term from the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion will be multiplied by every term in the second expansion, which are terms like \\(c^6\\), \\(6c^4\\), \\(15c^2\\), \\(20\\), \\(15c^{-2}\\), \\(6c^{-4}\\), and \\(c^{-6}\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part (which is 6) multiplied by each of these terms. But wait, no, because each term in the second expansion has a coefficient and a variable part. So, when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term, you get terms like \\(6c^6a^2b^2\\), \\(36c^4a^2b^2\\), etc. So, each of these will contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when considering the entire product, but only if we're considering the coefficient without any \\(c\\) terms. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). Wait, no, actually, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so it's just the coefficient, without considering \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Because each term in the second part contributes its coefficient to the multiplication with \\(a^2b^2\\), thus summing up all the coefficients from the second part and multiplying by 6.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought that substituting \\(c = 1\\) into the second polynomial gives the sum of its coefficients, which is 64. So, if I substitute \\(c = 1\\), \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\), which is the sum of the coefficients. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nBut wait, let me think again. If I have two polynomials, P and Q, then the coefficient of a specific term in P * Q is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in P and Q that multiply to give that term. But in this case, since \\(a^2b^2\\) is only in P, and Q doesn't have \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), then when you multiply, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in P * Q is the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in P multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in Q. Because each term in Q will multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term, effectively adding their coefficients to the overall coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\).\n\nWait, but that seems a bit off. Let me test it with a smaller example. Suppose P = (a + b)^1 = a + b, and Q = (c + 1/c)^1 = c + 1/c. Then, P * Q = (a + b)(c + 1/c) = a c + a/c + b c + b/c. The coefficient of \\(a\\) in this product is c + 1/c, which is not just the coefficient from P times the sum of coefficients from Q. Similarly, the coefficient of \\(b\\) is also c + 1/c. So, in this case, the coefficient of \\(a\\) is not 1 * 2 = 2, but rather it's c + 1/c, which is a Laurent polynomial. So, in this case, the coefficient of \\(a\\) is not a number, but another polynomial. Therefore, in the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is not a number, but a Laurent polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient, which suggests it's a numerical coefficient, implying that perhaps the problem is considering terms where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out, i.e., the constant term.\n\nWait, that might be the case. So, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, considering all possible terms, but specifically the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, i.e., the constant term. Because otherwise, the coefficient would be a Laurent polynomial, which doesn't make much sense in this context. So, maybe I misinterpreted the problem. Let me re-read it.\n\nThe problem says: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which could mean the coefficient regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, but that doesn't make sense because the coefficient would then be a polynomial in \\(c\\). Alternatively, it might mean the coefficient of the term \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the constant term in \\(c\\). That would make sense, as the problem is likely expecting a numerical coefficient.\n\nSo, perhaps I need to find the term in the product where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out, so that the term is \\(a^2b^2\\) times a constant. So, in that case, I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\).\n\nOkay, that makes more sense. So, let's approach it that way. So, first, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, as we found earlier. Now, we need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). The constant term is the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero.\n\nSo, let's expand \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem. The general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(1/c\\right)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be zero, so we set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\), which is 20.\n\nTherefore, the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 20. So, when we multiply the two expansions together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by the constant term 20 from the second part, resulting in the term \\(20a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 20.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was 6 * 64 = 384, but that was when considering all coefficients in the second polynomial. But if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), which would be the sum of all coefficients multiplied by 6, that would give 384. But if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where \\(c\\) cancels out, then it's 6 * 20 = 120. Wait, no, wait, no. Wait, no, actually, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the sum over all coefficients in the second expansion multiplied by 6. But if we're only considering the term where \\(c\\) is zero, i.e., the constant term, then it's 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but let's clarify. The problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\". If we're considering the entire expression, which includes terms with different powers of \\(c\\), then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually be a polynomial in \\(c\\), because each term in the second expansion would multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term, contributing their coefficients. So, the coefficient would be \\(6 \\times \\left(c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15c^{-2} + 6c^{-4} + c^{-6}\\right)\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient, which is usually a number, so perhaps it's asking for the coefficient when considering all possible \\(c\\) terms, but that doesn't make sense because it's a polynomial. Alternatively, it might be asking for the coefficient of the term \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the constant term in \\(c\\). \n\nGiven that the problem is from a math competition or a textbook, it's more likely that it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by a constant (with no \\(c\\) terms). So, in that case, the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nBut let me check again. Let's think about how the multiplication works. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6a\u00b2b\u00b2. When we multiply this by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which expands to \\(c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15c^{-2} + 6c^{-4} + c^{-6}\\), the product will have terms:\n\n6a\u00b2b\u00b2c\u2076 + 36a\u00b2b\u00b2c\u2074 + 90a\u00b2b\u00b2c\u00b2 + 120a\u00b2b\u00b2 + 90a\u00b2b\u00b2c^{-2} + 36a\u00b2b\u00b2c^{-4} + 6a\u00b2b\u00b2c^{-6}\n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, without considering \\(c\\), would be the sum of all these coefficients, which is 6 + 36 + 90 + 120 + 90 + 36 + 6 = let's calculate that:\n\n6 + 36 = 42\n\n42 + 90 = 132\n\n132 + 120 = 252\n\n252 + 90 = 342\n\n342 + 36 = 378\n\n378 + 6 = 384\n\nSo, the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial is 64, as we found earlier, and 6 * 64 = 384, which matches the total sum here.\n\nBut the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which, as we saw, is a Laurent polynomial in \\(c\\). However, the problem likely expects a numerical coefficient, which suggests that it's asking for the coefficient when the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out, i.e., the constant term. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is 120.\n\nBut wait, let me check the problem statement again. It says: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, it's not specifying any particular power of \\(c\\), just \\(a^2b^2\\). So, in the entire expansion, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be a sum of terms, each multiplied by different powers of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient is not a single number, but a Laurent polynomial. However, the problem is likely expecting a numerical answer, so perhaps it's considering the term where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out, i.e., the constant term.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is considering the coefficient in the sense of the entire expression, which would be the sum of all coefficients from the second polynomial multiplied by 6, giving 384. But that seems too large, and usually, such problems expect a specific term, not the sum.\n\nWait, let's look for similar problems. If the problem was just \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. If it's multiplied by another polynomial, say, in \\(c\\), and the problem asks for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), it's ambiguous. But in most cases, unless specified, it's asking for the coefficient when considering the entire expression, which would include all powers of \\(c\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, which doesn't make sense for a numerical answer. Therefore, the problem is likely asking for the coefficient of the term \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the constant term in \\(c\\).\n\nTherefore, the coefficient is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (the constant term from the second part), giving 120.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought that when you multiply the two polynomials, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the entire second polynomial, but that's not the case because each term in the second polynomial contributes to different terms in the product. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is actually \\(6a^2b^2\\) multiplied by each term in the second polynomial, which gives all the terms I listed before. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is actually a polynomial in \\(c\\), which is 6 times the second polynomial. But the problem is asking for the coefficient, which is a number, so perhaps it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is considering the entire product and wants the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\), which would mean summing over all coefficients in the second polynomial, giving 6 * 64 = 384. But that seems too high, and usually, such problems expect a specific term.\n\nWait, let me think differently. Maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, considering all possible terms, but that would mean the coefficient is a Laurent polynomial, which isn't a number. Therefore, the problem must be asking for the coefficient of the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by a constant term, i.e., the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). Therefore, the answer is 120.\n\nBut to be thorough, let me calculate both possibilities:\n\n1. If the problem wants the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), it's 6 * 64 = 384.\n\n2. If it wants the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), it's 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nGiven that the problem is likely expecting a numerical answer, and considering that in such contexts, they usually ask for the constant term when multiple variables are involved, I think the answer is 120.\n\nBut wait, let me check another approach. Let's consider that when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each polynomial that multiply to give that term. But in this case, since \\(a^2b^2\\) is only in the first polynomial, and the second polynomial has no \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial multiplied by the entire second polynomial. But that doesn't make sense because the coefficient should be a number, not a polynomial.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think about it differently. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\cdot \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the first part, and when you multiply it by the second part, which is a Laurent polynomial in \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 multiplied by the entire Laurent polynomial. Therefore, the coefficient is 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that's a Laurent polynomial, not a number. Therefore, the problem must be asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 6 times the constant term of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 120.\n\nBut let me confirm once more. Let's compute the product step by step.\n\nFirst, \\((a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\).\n\nSecond, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15c^{-2} + 6c^{-4} + c^{-6}\\).\n\nNow, when we multiply these two, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, resulting in:\n\n6a\u00b2b\u00b2c\u2076 + 36a\u00b2b\u00b2c\u2074 + 90a\u00b2b\u00b2c\u00b2 + 120a\u00b2b\u00b2 + 90a\u00b2b\u00b2c^{-2} + 36a\u00b2b\u00b2c^{-4} + 6a\u00b2b\u00b2c^{-6}.\n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is a Laurent polynomial: 6c\u2076 + 36c\u2074 + 90c\u00b2 + 120 + 90c^{-2} + 36c^{-4} + 6c^{-6}.\n\nBut the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is this entire expression. However, since the problem is presented in a way that expects a numerical answer, it's likely that it's asking for the coefficient of the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, i.e., the constant term. Therefore, the coefficient is 120.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6. Then, we find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20. Multiplying these together gives 6 * 20 = 120.\n\n$\\boxed{120}$"

    "text": " The same goes for \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since I'm only asked about the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), maybe I don't need to worry about the \\(c\\) terms at all? Wait, no, because the entire expression is the product of both expansions. So, I think I'll need to consider both parts, but perhaps the \\(c\\) terms won't affect the \\(a^2b^2\\) term directly. Let me think more carefully.\n\nFirst, let's tackle \\((a + b)^4\\). Using the binomial theorem, the expansion will be the sum from \\(k = 0\\) to \\(4\\) of \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\\). I'm looking for the term where \\(a^2b^2\\), so that would correspond to \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). So, the coefficient here is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Let me compute that: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6.\n\nNow, the second part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me expand this as well. Using the binomial theorem again, it's the sum from \\(m = 0\\) to \\(6\\) of \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying that, each term becomes \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the exponent of \\(c\\) in each term is \\(6 - 2m\\).\n\nNow, since the entire expression is the product of \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), when I multiply them together, each term from the first expansion will multiply each term from the second expansion. But I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, I need to find all terms in the product where the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) parts are \\(a^2b^2\\), and then the \\(c\\) parts can be anything, but since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), maybe the \\(c\\) terms will just contribute a factor that multiplies the coefficient from the first part. Wait, no, that doesn't seem right because the \\(c\\) terms are separate. So, perhaps I'm overcomplicating.\n\nWait, no, actually, when you multiply two expressions together, each term from the first expression multiplies each term from the second. But since the first expression is in terms of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the second is in terms of \\(c\\), the product will have terms that are products of \\(a^kb^{4 - k}\\) and \\(c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first expression is \\(6a^2b^2\\), and when multiplied by each term in the second expansion, which is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\), the product will have terms like \\(6a^2b^2 \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\).\n\nBut wait, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). That is, in the entire product, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). But that doesn't make sense because each term in the product will have both \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) parts and \\(c\\) parts. So, actually, I think the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by any power of \\(c\\). So, in other words, the coefficient is 6 multiplied by the entire second expansion, but that can't be right because the coefficient would then be a polynomial in \\(c\\), not a single number. Hmm, maybe I misinterpreted the problem.\n\nWait, no, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, so the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\). But that seems a bit odd. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by some specific power of \\(c\\), but the problem doesn't specify, so perhaps I need to clarify.\n\nWait, let me read the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, it's just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in other words, when you multiply out the entire expression, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by a sum of terms involving powers of \\(c\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the sum of all the coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by the coefficient from the first expansion.\n\nWait, that makes sense. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient from the first part (which is 6) multiplied by the entire second expansion. But that would make the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) equal to \\(6 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems like it's not a constant; it's another polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient, which is usually a number, so maybe I'm misunderstanding.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, considering all possible terms. But that would mean that the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which is a bit unusual. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some specific \\(k\\), but it's not specified. Hmm.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Maybe the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, so the coefficient would be the coefficient from the first expansion times the entire second expansion. So, the coefficient would be \\(6 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems like the answer would be a polynomial in \\(c\\), not a single number. So, maybe I'm misinterpreting the question.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is actually to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, so that the entire term is \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), which is 1. So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). That would make sense because then the coefficient would be a number, not a polynomial.\n\nSo, perhaps that's the correct interpretation. Let me proceed with that assumption. So, first, find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, as I found earlier. Then, find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), and then multiply those two coefficients together to get the final coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\).\n\nSo, let's compute the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem, the expansion is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^6 \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^6 \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\).\n\nWe want the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\).\n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire expression is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nWait, but let me double-check that. Is there another way to approach this? Alternatively, maybe I should consider that when you multiply the two expansions, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will multiply each term from the second part, but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, perhaps the coefficient is just 6 times the entire second expansion. But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, which doesn't make sense for a coefficient. Therefore, I think my initial approach is correct: the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), so the answer is 120.\n\nWait, but just to be thorough, let me consider another approach. Let's expand both expressions and see how the terms multiply.\n\nFirst, \\((a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\).\n\nSecond, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = c^6 + 6c^5 \\times \\dfrac{1}{c} + 15c^4 \\times \\dfrac{1}{c^2} + 20c^3 \\times \\dfrac{1}{c^3} + 15c^2 \\times \\dfrac{1}{c^4} + 6c \\times \\dfrac{1}{c^5} + \\dfrac{1}{c^6}\\).\n\nSimplifying each term:\n\n- \\(c^6\\)\n- \\(6c^4\\)\n- \\(15c^2\\)\n- \\(20c^0 = 20\\)\n- \\(15c^{-2}\\)\n- \\(6c^{-4}\\)\n- \\(c^{-6}\\)\n\nNow, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion will multiply each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion will multiply each term in the second expansion, resulting in:\n\n- \\(6a^2b^2c^6\\)\n- \\(6a^2b^2 \\times 6c^4 = 36a^2b^2c^4\\)\n- \\(6a^2b^2 \\times 15c^2 = 90a^2b^2c^2\\)\n- \\(6a^2b^2 \\times 20 = 120a^2b^2\\)\n- \\(6a^2b^2 \\times 15c^{-2} = 90a^2b^2c^{-2}\\)\n- \\(6a^2b^2 \\times 6c^{-4} = 36a^2b^2c^{-4}\\)\n- \\(6a^2b^2 \\times c^{-6} = 6a^2b^2c^{-6}\\)\n\nSo, in the entire expansion, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is present in multiple terms, each multiplied by different powers of \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would be the coefficient when the power of \\(c\\) is zero. From the above, the only term with \\(a^2b^2\\) and \\(c^0\\) is \\(120a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient is 120.\n\nWait, but let me check again. So, in the product, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\) is indeed \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). So, that seems consistent.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem had asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^2\\), it would have been 90, but since it's just \\(a^2b^2\\), I think the intended interpretation is that the coefficient is 120.\n\nWait, but another thought: perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), meaning that the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\). But that seems unlikely because coefficients are usually constants, not polynomials. So, I think the correct interpretation is that it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nTherefore, after all this thinking, I believe the coefficient is 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break down the problem into two parts using the binomial theorem.\n\n1. **Expanding \\((a + b)^4\\):**\n   Using the binomial theorem, the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is:\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4-k}b^k\n   \\]\n   We need the term where \\(a^2b^2\\), which corresponds to \\(k = 2\\).

So, I think I should focus on expanding the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), and then see how it interacts with the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nLet me start by expanding \\((a + b)^4\\). Using the binomial theorem, which states that \\((x + y)^n = \\sum_{k=0}^{n} \\dbinom{n}{k} x^{n - k} y^k\\), I can write:\n\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k} b^k\n\\]\n\nI need the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2, so \\(a^2b^2\\).

So, the coefficient from the first part is 6.\n\nNow, the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I need to consider how this multiplication affects the term \\(a^2b^2\\). Since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), it's just a scalar multiple when multiplied by the second expression. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression will be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nWait, no, that's not quite right. Actually, when I multiply two polynomials, each term from the first polynomial gets multiplied by each term from the second polynomial. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term without \\(c\\), I'm actually looking for the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because only the constant term will result in a term that doesn't have \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\).

So, the constant term is 20.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the constant term in the second part), which is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nWait, but let me double-check to make sure I didn't make a mistake. So, the first part's coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, and the second part's constant term is 20. Multiplying them gives 120. That seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider if the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is only from the first part, and when multiplied by the entire second part, but since the second part includes terms with \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), unless we're combining terms, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term would just be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, but since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Wait, no, actually, the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term in the product, but since the second part has variables \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, but the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would include all the terms from the second expansion multiplied by 6. Wait, that doesn't make sense because \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term without \\(c\\), so when multiplied by the second expression, each term in the second expression would have a \\(c\\) term, so the product would have terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2 \\cdot \\dfrac{1}{c^k}\\), but not just \\(a^2b^2\\). So, actually, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would only appear once in the product when multiplied by the constant term from the second expression, which is 20. So, the coefficient is 6 times 20, which is 120.\n\nWait, but hold on, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product. But in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the variables \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\). So, when you multiply them, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, but since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), it's only the part that comes from the product where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by the constant term in the second expansion. So, yes, that would be 6 times 20, which is 120.\n\nWait, but let me think again. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). When you expand this, each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, actually, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be present in the product for each term in the second expansion, but each multiplied by a different power of \\(c\\). However, the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would include all the coefficients from each term in the second expansion, but that's not the case because \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term independent of \\(c\\). Therefore, to get \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms, it must be multiplied by the constant term in the second expansion. So, the coefficient is 6 times 20, which is 120.\n\nWait, but another way to think about it is that the entire expression is a product of two polynomials, and when you multiply them, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the sum of the products of the coefficients of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial and each term in the second polynomial. But since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term without \\(c\\), the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is by multiplying \\(a^2b^2\\) by the constant term in the second polynomial. So, that's why it's 6 times 20, which is 120.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider that the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, so it's 6 times the entire second expansion, but that doesn't make sense because the second expansion includes terms with \\(c\\). So, no, I think my initial reasoning is correct: it's 6 times the constant term in the second expansion, which is 20, giving 120.\n\nWait, but let me check another approach. Suppose I consider the entire product as a product of two polynomials, and I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in the first polynomial, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, and in the second polynomial, every term is a multiple of some power of \\(c\\), but since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), it's just 6 times the entire second polynomial, but that's not correct because when you multiply, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial. But wait, the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times 64, which is 384. But that can't be right because that would mean the coefficient includes all powers of \\(c\\), but the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not considering \\(c\\). So, I think that approach is incorrect.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm confusing the variables. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so regardless of what happens with \\(c\\), we just need to find how much \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by. But in reality, \\(a^2b^2\\) is being multiplied by each term in the second expansion, each of which has a different power of \\(c\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be \\(a^2b^2 \\times\\) (each term in the second expansion). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Because each term in the second part contributes to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\).\n\nWait, that makes sense. Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, each term has a coefficient, and all those coefficients add up to the total coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. So, the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion is indeed found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 times 64, which is 384.\n\nBut wait, this contradicts my earlier reasoning where I thought it was 120. So, which one is correct?\n\nLet me clarify: the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). In the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, which includes terms like \\(c^6\\), \\(c^4\\), ..., \\(c^0\\), ..., \\(c^{-6}\\). Therefore, in the product, \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each of these terms, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), ..., \\(a^2b^2\\), ..., \\(a^2b^2c^{-6}\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the sum of the coefficients from each term in the second expansion multiplied by 6.\n\nWait, but actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, because each term in the second expansion contributes its coefficient to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion is when \\(c = 1\\), which is 64, so 6 times 64 is 384.\n\nBut earlier, I thought it was 120, which was 6 times the constant term. So, which is correct?\n\nI think I made a mistake earlier by only considering the constant term. Actually, since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), it's the sum of all the coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by 6. Therefore, the correct answer should be 6 times 64, which is 384.\n\nWait, but let me think again. If I have two polynomials, P(a, b) and Q(c), then the coefficient of a specific term in P(a, b) times Q(c) is the coefficient of that term in P(a, b) times the sum of all coefficients in Q(c). Because when you multiply, each term in P is multiplied by each term in Q, so the coefficient of a specific term in P is scaled by each coefficient in Q, and all those contributions add up.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So, in this case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). The sum of all coefficients is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me check this with a smaller example to make sure. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^1 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). The expansion would be \\((a + b)(c + 1/c)\\). The coefficient of \\(a^1b^0\\) would be 1 times the sum of coefficients in \\((c + 1/c)\\), which is 2, so 1 * 2 = 2. Indeed, when you expand, you get \\(ac + a/c + bc + b/c\\). The coefficient of \\(a\\) is 2, which is correct.\n\nSimilarly, if I take \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^0\\) would be \\(\\dbinom{2}{2} = 1\\) times the sum of coefficients in \\((c + 1/c)\\), which is 2, so 1 * 2 = 2. Expanding, \\((a^2 + 2ab + b^2)(c + 1/c)\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) is 2, which is correct.\n\nTherefore, applying this to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times 64, which is 384.\n\nWait, but in my initial approach, I considered only the constant term, which gave me 120, but now with this smaller example, it seems that the correct approach is to multiply by the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial, which gives 384.\n\nSo, I think I made a mistake earlier by only considering the constant term. The correct approach is to multiply the coefficient from the first part by the sum of all coefficients in the second part because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\).\n\nTherefore, the coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me check again with another example. Suppose \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^2\\). The coefficient of \\(a^2b^0\\) would be \\(\\dbinom{2}{2} = 1\\) times the sum of coefficients in \\((c + 1/c)^2\\), which is \\((1 + 1)^2 = 4\\). So, the coefficient would be 1 * 4 = 4. Expanding, \\((a^2 + 2ab + b^2)(c^2 + 2 + 1/c^2)\\). The coefficient of \\(a^2\\) is indeed 4 (from \\(a^2c^2 + 2a^2 + a^2/c^2\\)), so that's correct.\n\nTherefore, applying this to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but in the original problem, the second polynomial is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). The sum of its coefficients is indeed \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nSo, I think my initial approach was incorrect because I only considered the constant term, but the correct approach is to consider all coefficients in the second polynomial because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\).\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 384.\n\nWait, but let me double-check one more time. Let's consider the expansion:\n\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\n\\]\n\nand\n\n\\[\n\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15/c^2 + 6/c^4 + 1/c^6\n\\]\n\nNow, when we multiply these two, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, resulting in:\n\n\\[\n6a^2b^2c^6 + 36a^2b^2c^4 + 90a^2b^2c^2 + 120a^2b^2 + 90a^2b^2/c^2 + 36a^2b^2/c^4 + 6a^2b^2/c^6\n\\]\n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120, but that's only the term where \\(c\\) is raised to the zero power. However, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would include all terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any power of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by 6, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but in the expanded form, each term like \\(6a^2b^2c^6\\) has a coefficient of 6, but in reality, the coefficients from the second expansion are 1, 6, 15, 20, 15, 6, 1. So, when multiplied by 6, they become 6, 36, 90, 120, 90, 36, 6. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^6\\) is 6, \\(a^2b^2c^4\\) is 36, \\(a^2b^2c^2\\) is 90, \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120, \\(a^2b^2/c^2\\) is 90, \\(a^2b^2/c^4\\) is 36, and \\(a^2b^2/c^6\\) is 6.\n\nBut the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is specifically the term without any \\(c\\) terms. So, in that case, the coefficient is 120. Wait, now I'm confused again.\n\nWait, the problem says: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)\". So, it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in the product, \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), etc. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the sum of all the coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by 6, because each term in the second expansion contributes to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\).\n\nBut when I look at the expanded form, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) only appears once, with a coefficient of 120, which is 6 times 20. So, why is that?\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, in the product, \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, each of which has a different power of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the sum of all the coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by 6, because each term in the second expansion contributes to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\).\n\nBut when I expanded it, I saw that \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, resulting in terms like \\(6a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(36a^2b^2c^4\\), etc., but the term \\(a^2b^2\\) itself is only present once, with a coefficient of 120. So, perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when it's multiplied by \\(c^0\\), which is 120. But the wording is a bit ambiguous.\n\nWait, let me read the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)\". It doesn't specify anything about \\(c\\), so I think it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient would be the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by 6, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nBut when I expanded the product, I saw that the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is only present once, with a coefficient of 120, because it's multiplied by the constant term. So, perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when it's multiplied by \\(c^0\\), which is 120. But that depends on the interpretation.\n\nWait, maybe I should consider that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, which includes all terms. So, \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, each with their own coefficients, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the sum of all those products, which is 6 * (1 + 6 + 15 + 20 + 15 + 6 + 1) = 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nBut in the expanded form, the term \\(a^2b^2c^6\\) has a coefficient of 6, \\(a^2b^2c^4\\) has 36, \\(a^2b^2c^2\\) has 90, \\(a^2b^2\\) has 120, \\(a^2b^2/c^2\\) has 90, \\(a^2b^2/c^4\\) has 36, and \\(a^2b^2/c^6\\) has 6. So, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), it would include all these terms, but each has a different power of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by 6, which is 384.\n\nBut in reality, each term like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\) is a separate term, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) specifically (without any \\(c\\) terms) is 120. So, I think the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when it's multiplied by \\(c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nWait, but the problem didn't specify any condition on \\(c\\), so it's ambiguous. But in the context of such problems, usually, when they ask for the coefficient of a term like \\(a^2b^2\\), they are referring to the term where the variables are exactly \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of other variables. So, in this case, since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would only appear when multiplied by the constant term in the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nBut earlier, when I thought about the sum of coefficients, I considered that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, giving 384. But that would mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 384, which includes all the terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any power of \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term without \\(c\\), so it's only the constant term.\n\nWait, but no, actually, in the product, \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, which includes terms with \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, the product will have terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), etc. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by 6, because each term in the second expansion contributes to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nBut in reality, when you look at the expanded product, each term \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) has a coefficient, and the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) specifically (without \\(c\\)) is only 120. So, I'm getting conflicting interpretations.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, regardless of the power of \\(c\\). That is, it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the combined expression, which would include all the terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present, each multiplied by different powers of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the sum of all the coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by 6, which is 384.\n\nBut when I expand the product, I see that each term \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) has its own coefficient, and the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) specifically is 120. So, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when it's not multiplied by any \\(c\\) terms, which is 120.\n\nI think the confusion arises from whether the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\) or specifically when it's multiplied by \\(c^0\\). In the absence of additional context, I think it's more likely that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when it's multiplied by \\(c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nWait, but in the expansion, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is only multiplied by the constant term, giving 120. So, I think that's the answer intended by the problem.\n\nTherefore, after this lengthy thought process, I conclude that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by expanding each part separately and then identifying the relevant terms.\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\)** using the binomial theorem:\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k} b^k\n   \\]\n   The term with \\(a^2b^2\\) occurs when \\(k = 2\\), giving the coefficient:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\n   \\]\n\n2. **Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)** using the binomial theorem:\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n   \\]\n   The constant term (where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0) occurs when \\(m = 3\\), giving the coefficient:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\n   \\]\n\n3. **Combine the coefficients**: The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the product of the two coefficients:\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 20 = 120\n   \\]\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

Let me break it down.\n\nStarting with the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\). Using the binomial theorem, the expansion is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k} b^{k}\\). I'm looking for the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2. So that would be when \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). So the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in this part is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Let me compute that: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\\). So the coefficient from the first part is 6.\n\nNow, looking at the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I need to figure out how this part affects the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, actually, the second part involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), so when I multiply the two expansions together, the terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) might not directly affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again.\n\nWait, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first expansion will be multiplied by every term in the second expansion. But since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), maybe the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the entire second expansion. But wait, that can't be right because the second expansion includes terms with different powers of \\(c\\), but we're only interested in the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. Hmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding.\n\nWait, actually, no. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, so when you multiply the two expansions, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, but the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, each term contributes its own coefficient, but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, the coefficients from the second expansion will just add up.\n\nWait, but that might not be accurate. Let me clarify: when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum of the products of the coefficients of terms whose variables multiply to give that specific term. But in this case, since the second polynomial doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), the only way \\(a^2b^2\\) can come about is from the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first expansion multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, each term contributes its coefficient, and since \\(a^2b^2\\) is being multiplied by each of those, the total coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the product of the coefficients.\n\nWait, but actually, no. Because when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial, and the coefficients are multiplied. But since the second polynomial is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial in \\(c\\), and the first polynomial is in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), the variables are different. So when you multiply them, the terms will be products of terms from each polynomial. So, for example, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first polynomial will be multiplied by each term in the second polynomial, each contributing their own coefficients and powers of \\(c\\). However, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but it doesn't specify any condition on \\(c\\). So perhaps the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is just the coefficient from the first part times the entire expansion of the second part. But that doesn't make sense because the coefficient should be a single number, not a polynomial.\n\nWait, maybe I misread the problem. Let me check again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, actually, the expression is a product of two polynomials, one in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the other in \\(c\\). So when you multiply them, the resulting expression will have terms that are products of terms from each polynomial. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial will be multiplied by each term in the second polynomial, each of which is a term in \\(c\\). So the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial. Because each term in the second polynomial contributes its coefficient when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), so the total coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second polynomial.\n\nWait, but the sum of the coefficients in the second polynomial \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\). Let me compute that. If \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(1 + 1/1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So the sum of the coefficients in the second polynomial is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. Alternatively, maybe I should consider that when you multiply the two polynomials, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in the second polynomial, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is indeed the coefficient from the first part times the sum of the coefficients from the second part. Because each term in the second polynomial contributes its own coefficient when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), so the total coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me think again: when you have two polynomials multiplied together, the coefficient of a term like \\(a^2b^2\\) is the product of the coefficients of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial and the coefficients of the terms in the second polynomial, but since the second polynomial doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) is by taking the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first polynomial and multiplying it by each term in the second polynomial. So the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is indeed the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all coefficients in the second part. So that would be 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me confirm this by expanding a bit more. The first expansion is \\((a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). The second expansion is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Let me compute that. Using the binomial theorem, it's \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(1/c\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So the terms are from \\(c^6\\) down to \\(c^{-6}\\) in steps of 2. The sum of the coefficients in this expansion is when \\(c = 1\\), which is 2^6 = 64, as I thought before.\n\nNow, when I multiply the two expansions, each term in the first will be multiplied by each term in the second. So the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, which has coefficients from 1 to 64 when summed. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be \\(6 * 64 = 384\\). So I think that's the answer.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me think of another approach. Alternatively, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the product of the coefficients of \\(a^2b^2\\) in each part, but since the second part doesn't have \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), the coefficient is just 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second part, which is 64, giving 384. So yeah, that seems correct.\n\nI don't think I made any mistakes here. So the coefficient is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Next, the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), giving \\(2^6 = 64\\). Multiplying these together gives \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n\\boxed{384}"

So, maybe I don't need to worry about the second part because it's multiplied by the first, but I'm not sure yet. Let me think.\n\nAlright, let's start with the first part: \\((a + b)^4\\). Using the binomial theorem, the expansion is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^4 \\binom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\\). So, the general term is \\(\\binom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\\). I need the term where the exponents of both \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2, right? So, that would be when \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). Let me check: if \\(4 - k = 2\\), then \\(k = 2\\). So, the coefficient here is \\(\\binom{4}{2}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\binom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6.\n\nNow, the expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, does this affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)? Hmm, I think so because when you multiply two expressions, each term from the first is multiplied by each term from the second. But wait, since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), maybe I just need to consider the coefficient from the first part and then multiply it by the entire expansion of the second part, but that doesn't make sense because \\(a^2b^2\\) wouldn't have any \\(c\\) terms. Wait, that can't be right. Let me think again.\n\nWait, no, when you multiply two polynomials, each term from the first is multiplied by each term from the second. So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), that term would be present in the first part, and when multiplied by any term from the second part, it would become \\(a^2b^2\\) times some term from the second expansion. But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I think it's actually considering the entire expression, so the coefficient would be the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all terms from the second part, but that doesn't seem right because \\(a^2b^2\\) isn't multiplied by anything else except the second expansion. Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this.\n\nWait, actually, no. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the first part, and when you multiply it by the entire second part, it's just \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, that's not correct because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term in the product. But in the product, each term from the first expansion is multiplied by each term from the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the entire second expansion. But that doesn't make sense because the second expansion has terms with \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), so \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by each of those, making terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), etc. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which in the entire product would only be the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero because otherwise, it's not just \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, that makes more sense.\n\nSo, actually, I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\) in the product. Because if I'm looking for the term \\(a^2b^2\\), it's when the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out, so \\(c^0\\). So, the coefficient would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). That makes sense because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by \\(c^0\\), you just get \\(a^2b^2\\), and the coefficient would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion.\n\nSo, now I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let's expand that using the binomial theorem. The expansion is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^6 \\binom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^6 \\binom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, each term is \\(\\binom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be 0, so we set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). So, the coefficient is \\(\\binom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\binom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\).\n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the second part), which is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but let me double-check to make sure I didn't make a mistake. So, the first part: \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6. The second part: \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. So, 6 * 20 = 120. That seems correct. I don't think I made any mistakes here. So, the final answer should be 120.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break down the problem into two parts using the binomial theorem.\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\):**\n   The general term in the expansion is \\(\\binom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\\).

We seek the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, which occurs at \\(m = 3\\), giving the coefficient \\(\\binom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n\n3. **Multiply the coefficients:**\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

So, applying this to \\((a + b)^4\\), each term will be \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k} b^k\\). I need the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2. That means \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Let me calculate that: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\\). So, the coefficient is 6.\n\nBut wait, the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, does this affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)? Hmm, let me think. Since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), when I multiply the two expansions, the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) will be multiplied by terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). However, the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\). That means I'm only interested in the part of the product where the \\(a^2b^2\\) term is multiplied by the constant term (i.e., the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero) in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because if it's multiplied by any other term involving \\(c\\), the resulting term would have \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or something like that, which isn't what we're looking for.\n\nSo, I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me apply the binomial theorem again here. The expansion is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the exponent of \\(c\\) is \\(6 - 2m\\). I need this exponent to be zero because that's the constant term. So, setting \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Let me compute that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20.\n\nNow, going back to the original expression, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by this constant term 20 from the second part. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nWait, let me double-check that. So, the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the constant term from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 20. Multiplying them together gives 120. That seems right.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of the entire expansion as the product of two expansions: one in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and another in \\(c\\). Since the variables are independent, the coefficients multiply when you take the product of terms from each expansion. So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6, and since we're only interested in the terms where the \\(c\\) terms cancel out (i.e., the constant term), which is 20, the total coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nI don't think I made any mistakes here. The steps seem logical: find the coefficient in each relevant part and then multiply them because they're independent terms.

Or maybe I need to multiply the coefficients from both parts? Let me think.\n\nActually, since the entire expression is a product of two binomials, \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), when expanded, each term will be a product of a term from the first binomial and a term from the second.

But wait, that doesn't seem right because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by some terms in \\(c\\). Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating this.\n\nLet me clarify: when you have two separate expressions multiplied together, each term in the expansion is a product of a term from each part. So, if I'm looking for a term that has \\(a^2b^2\\), that term must come from multiplying a term in \\((a + b)^4\\) that has \\(a^2b^2\\) by a term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) that has \\(c^0\\), because \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\). Wait, but \\(c^0\\) is 1, so maybe the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). That makes sense because when you multiply the two terms together, you get \\(a^2b^2 \\times 1\\), so the coefficient would be the product of the two coefficients.\n\nSo, first, let me find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\). Using the binomial theorem, the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^{k}\\). So, the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) occurs is when \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient from the first part is 6.\n\nNext, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Again, using the binomial theorem, the expansion is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying each term, that becomes \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m - m} = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We want the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so we set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\) so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). Wait, is that right? Let me double-check: 6! is 720, 3! is 6, so 720/(6*6) is 720/36, which is indeed 20. So, the coefficient from the second part is 20.\n\nNow, since the two parts are multiplied together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the two coefficients we found. So, that's 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient should be 120.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't miss anything. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\) with coefficient 6, and the term \\(c^0\\) comes from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) with coefficient 20. So, when you multiply these two terms, you get \\(6 \\times 20 \\times a^2b^2 \\times 1\\), which is \\(120a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient is indeed 120. I think that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of the entire expression as \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, when you expand both, each term is a product of a term from each expansion. So, to get a term with \\(a^2b^2\\), you need to take the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part and multiply it by any term from the second part. But since the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), but wait, no, actually, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would be the sum of all terms where the product includes \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by any power of \\(c\\). Wait, but that's not possible because \\(a^2b^2\\) is a separate variable from \\(c\\). So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion, which doesn't make sense because the coefficient should be a number, not a polynomial.\n\nWait, I think I made a mistake earlier. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, when you expand this product, each term will be a product of a term from \\((a + b)^4\\) and a term from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, to get a term that is \\(a^2b^2\\), you need to take the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part and multiply it by a term from the second part that is a constant (i.e., \\(c^0\\)), because otherwise, you'd have \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2/c^k\\), which aren't just \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 20 = 120. So, that seems correct.\n\nWait, but let me check again. Suppose I expand \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) separately. The first expansion has terms like \\(a^4\\), \\(4a^3b\\), \\(6a^2b^2\\), \\(4ab^3\\), \\(b^4\\). The second expansion has terms like \\(c^6\\), \\(6c^5\\), \\(15c^4\\), \\(20c^3\\), \\(15c^2\\), \\(6c\\), \\(1\\), \\(6/c\\), \\(15/c^2\\), \\(20/c^3\\), \\(15/c^4\\), \\(6/c^5\\), \\(1/c^6\\). Now, when you multiply these two expansions together, each term from the first is multiplied by each term from the second. So, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, resulting in terms like \\(6a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(6a^2b^2 \\times 6c^5\\), and so on, down to \\(6a^2b^2 \\times 1\\), which is \\(6a^2b^2\\). Similarly, the term \\(4a^3b\\) will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, resulting in terms like \\(4a^3bc^6\\), etc.\n\nBut the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). That means we're only interested in the terms where the variables are exactly \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). Wait, no, actually, no. Because \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term, but when you multiply it by terms from the second expansion, you get terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^5\\), etc., but none of these are just \\(a^2b^2\\). The only way to get a term that is exactly \\(a^2b^2\\) is if it's multiplied by \\(c^0\\), which is 1. So, the only term that contributes to \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is \\(6a^2b^2 \\times 1\\), which gives \\(6a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient is 6. Wait, but that contradicts my earlier conclusion of 120. Hmm, so which is correct?\n\nWait, no, that can't be right because the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, when you expand it, each term is a product of a term from \\((a + b)^4\\) and a term from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, if you're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), you need to consider all terms where the product results in \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). But that's not possible because \\(a^2b^2\\) is separate from \\(c\\). Wait, no, that's not correct. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) can be multiplied by any power of \\(c\\), so in the entire expansion, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is actually present as \\(a^2b^2 \\times c^k\\) for various \\(k\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would be the sum of all coefficients where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any \\(c^k\\). But that's not correct because \\(a^2b^2\\) is a separate term; the coefficient would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion. Wait, no, that's not right either.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question. The problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\)\". So, in the entire expression, each term is a product of a term from the first expansion and a term from the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would only appear as \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by some term from the second expansion. But since the second expansion includes terms with \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) itself isn't present unless it's multiplied by \\(c^0\\), which is 1. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part, which is 6 * 20 = 120. So, that seems correct.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought that the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would only appear as \\(a^2b^2 \\times 1\\), so the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120. Alternatively, if the problem was asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some \\(k\\), then it would be different. But since it's just \\(a^2b^2\\), it's only when \\(k=0\\), so the coefficient is 120.\n\nWait, but to make sure, let's think of it differently. Suppose I consider the entire expression as a product of two polynomials: one in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and one in \\(c\\). So, when you multiply them, the variables are independent. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial and the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial. Wait, no, that's not correct because the second polynomial is in \\(c\\), so the sum of all coefficients would be when \\(c = 1\\), but that's not what we're doing here.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let's go back. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). When expanded, each term is of the form \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}a^{4 - k}b^k \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) occurs when \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\), so \\(k = 2\\). The coefficient from the first part is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Now, for the second part, we can have any term \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be \\(6a^2b^2 \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^{6 - 2m}\\) is \\(6 \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would require that the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, i.e., \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times \\dbinom{6}{3} = 6 \\times 20 = 120\\). So, that's correct.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just 6, but that's only if we're considering the term \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by \\(c^0\\). But in the entire expression, \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by all terms from the second expansion, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would actually be the sum of all coefficients where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any power of \\(c\\). But that's not possible because \\(a^2b^2\\) is a separate term. Wait, no, that's not correct. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) is just \\(a^2b^2\\), and in the product, it's multiplied by each term from the second expansion, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part. But that's not correct because the sum of all coefficients in the second part would be when \\(c = 1\\), which is \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). But that can't be right because that would mean that \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by the entire expansion, which would give a term \\(384a^2b^2\\), but that's not the case because each term in the second expansion is multiplied by each term in the first.\n\nWait, I think I'm confusing the concepts here. Let me try to clarify: when you have two polynomials multiplied together, say \\(P(a, b) \\times Q(c)\\), then each term in the product is a term from \\(P\\) multiplied by a term from \\(Q\\). So, if you're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, you need to consider all terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any term from \\(Q(c)\\). But since \\(Q(c)\\) is a polynomial in \\(c\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in \\(Q(c)\\), resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^5\\), etc. However, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would only include the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\), which is 1. Therefore, the coefficient is just \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nWait, but that seems contradictory because if I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = (1 + 1)^6 = 64\\), and the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, so the coefficient in the product would be \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). But that's not correct because when \\(c = 1\\), all terms in \\(Q(c)\\) become 1, so the product would have \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by 64, giving a coefficient of 384. But the problem is not asking for the value when \\(c = 1\\), it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, which is a polynomial in \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would only appear as \\(a^2b^2 \\times 1\\), so the coefficient is 120.\n\nWait, but let me think again. If I have the product \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), and I want the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), that would mean I'm looking for all terms in the expansion where the variables are \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by any power of \\(c\\). But \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term, and in the product, it's multiplied by each term from the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) itself isn't present unless it's multiplied by \\(c^0\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part, which is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but if I expand the entire expression, wouldn't the term \\(a^2b^2\\) appear multiplied by each term from the second expansion? So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^6\\) would be 6, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^5\\) would be 6 * 6 = 36, and so on, down to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) which is 6 * 20 = 120. So, in the entire expression, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is present as \\(a^2b^2c^6 + 36a^2b^2c^5 + ... + 120a^2b^2 + ... + 6a^2b^2/c^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) (i.e., the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0) is 120. So, that's correct.\n\nI think I've convinced myself that the coefficient is 120. So, the final answer should be 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is found using the binomial theorem: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). The coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying these gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\boxed{120}"

Let me think.\n\nWait, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\), right? Because the other part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), which are different variables. So, the \\(c\\) terms won't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. That means I can probably find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) separately and then multiply it by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, no, that doesn't make sense because the question is asking for the coefficient in the product, so actually, I just need the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of the other part. But no, wait again, maybe I'm overcomplicating it.\n\nLet me clarify: when you multiply two expressions, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression. But since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are different variables from \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), the only way to get a term with \\(a^2b^2\\) is to take the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from \\((a + b)^4\\) and multiply it by any term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, no, that's not correct because each term in the product will be of the form \\(a^kb^l c^m (1/c)^n\\), but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), we don't care about the \\(c\\) terms. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't make sense because the entire expansion is a sum of terms with \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), so when you multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), each term would have \\(a^2b^2\\) times something with \\(c\\). But the question is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which suggests that we're considering \\(a^2b^2\\) as a standalone term, which would only happen if the \\(c\\) terms somehow cancel out to a constant. Wait, no, that's not right. Actually, when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the product will have terms like \\(a^kb^l c^m (1/c)^n\\), but \\(a^2b^2\\) would be part of a term that also includes some \\(c\\) terms. However, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which implies that we're treating \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) as separate variables, so the coefficient would be the sum of all coefficients from the other part that, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), result in a term with \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, that seems a bit confusing. Maybe I should approach it differently.\n\nLet me break it down. First, find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\). Then, find the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, each term contributes a coefficient that will be part of the overall coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the overall coefficient would be the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the sum of coefficients from the second part. Wait, that makes sense because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term adds a coefficient that contributes to the overall coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. So, the total coefficient is (coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in first part) multiplied by (sum of coefficients in second part). Alternatively, maybe the sum of coefficients in the second part is the same as evaluating it at \\(c=1\\), because substituting \\(c=1\\) would make each term equal to its coefficient. Let me check that.\n\nYes, if I substitute \\(c=1\\) into \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), I get \\((1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\), which is the sum of all coefficients in that expansion. So, the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the coefficient from the first part multiplied by 64.\n\nNow, let's find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\). Using the binomial theorem, the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^4 \\binom{4}{k} a^{4 - k} b^k\\). We want the term where \\(a^2b^2\\), so \\(4 - k = 2\\) which implies \\(k=2\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(\\binom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n\nSo, the coefficient from the first part is 6, and the sum of coefficients from the second part is 64. Therefore, the total coefficient is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake. Another way to think about it is that when you multiply two expressions, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each expression. But in this case, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), so we're looking for all terms in the product where the \\(c\\) terms cancel out to 1, but that's not possible because \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) are variables. Alternatively, maybe the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, meaning that any term in the product that has \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by any combination of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) terms. But that would mean that the coefficient is just 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which would make the coefficient a polynomial in \\(c\\), but the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, so I think my initial approach was correct: the coefficient is 6 times the sum of coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. If I consider the entire product, each term is of the form \\(a^kb^l c^m (1/c)^n\\), where \\(k + l = 4\\) and \\(m + n = 6\\). The term \\(a^2b^2\\) occurs when \\(k=2\\) and \\(l=2\\), so the coefficient from the first part is 6, and for each term in the second part, the coefficient is whatever it is, and when multiplied by 6, it contributes to the overall coefficient. But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, perhaps the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of the second part. But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. Therefore, I must have made a mistake.\n\nWait, perhaps I misinterpreted the problem. Maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, treating \\(c\\) as a variable, but since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. That seems to make sense because when you multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), each term in the second expansion contributes its coefficient to the overall coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. So, the answer should be 384.\n\nWait, let me confirm with an example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^1 (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, \\((a + b)(c + 1/c)\\). The coefficient of \\(a^1b^0\\) is 1 (from \\(a\\)) times the sum of coefficients in \\((c + 1/c)\\), which is 2. So, the coefficient of \\(a\\) would be 1*2=2. Similarly, the coefficient of \\(b\\) would be 1*2=2. But if I expand it, I get \\(ac + a/c + bc + b/c\\). So, the coefficients of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are each 2, which matches. So, applying the same logic, in the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 * 64 = 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by substituting \\(c = 1\\), yielding \\(2^6 = 64\\). Multiplying these gives \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{384}"

But since I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I think I can focus on expanding just the part involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and then see how it interacts with the expansion of the other part.\n\nSo, let me start with \\((a + b)^4\\). Using the binomial theorem, which states that \\((x + y)^n = \\sum_{k=0}^{n} \\dbinom{n}{k} x^{n - k} y^k\\), I can expand this. Here, \\(x = a\\), \\(y = b\\), and \\(n = 4\\). I need the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2. That means I'm looking for the term where \\(k = 2\\) because \\(y^k = b^2\\).\n\nSo, the coefficient for \\(a^{4 - 2}b^2 = a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Let me calculate that: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\nNow, the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Since I'm only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I don't need to worry about the terms involving \\(c\\) because they won't affect the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). However, I do need to consider the entire coefficient from the \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) part because that will multiply the 6 I found earlier.\n\nWait, no, that's not quite right. Let me think again. The entire expression is a product of two expansions: one in terms of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the other in terms of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). Since I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), I actually don't need to consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) because when I multiply it by \\((a + b)^4\\), the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will just be multiplied by the entire expansion of the \\(c\\) terms. But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and not any specific term involving \\(c\\), I might have misunderstood.\n\nWait, no, actually, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product. But \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), so when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). However, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the sum of the coefficients from each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) multiplied by 6. But wait, no, that's not correct because each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is a term involving \\(c\\), and when you multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), you get terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2c^{-k}\\). But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term without any \\(c\\). So, that would only happen if the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, i.e., when \\(c^k \\cdot c^{-k} = c^0 = 1\\). So, in other words, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nAh, that makes sense. So, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is the same as the constant term. Let me calculate that.\n\nAgain, using the binomial theorem for \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We want the exponent of \\(c\\) to be zero, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\).\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20.\n\nNow, going back to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the coefficient from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) at \\(c^0\\). So that's 6 multiplied by 20, which is 120.\n\nWait, let me double-check that. So, \\((a + b)^4\\) gives a term \\(a^2b^2\\) with coefficient 6, and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) gives a constant term (i.e., \\(c^0\\)) with coefficient 20. So when we multiply these together, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but only the constant term will result in a term with just \\(a^2b^2\\). All other terms would have \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by some power of \\(c\\), which isn't what we want. So, the total coefficient is indeed 6 times 20, which is 120.\n\nLet me just make sure I didn't make any mistakes in the calculations. So, \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\) is correct because 4 choose 2 is 6. And for \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\), that's 20, which is also correct because 6 choose 3 is 20.

    "text": " The same goes for \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nWait, but the problem is asking specifically for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, I think I should focus on the part of the expression that involves \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) first, and then maybe see how the other part affects it. Let me write down the binomial expansion for \\((a + b)^4\\). \n\nUsing the binomial theorem, \\((a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^{k}\\). So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) would be when \\(4 - k = 2\\), which means \\(k = 2\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Let me calculate that: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6.\n\nNow, the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product of these two expansions. Wait, but \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are variables separate from \\(c\\), so when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are independent of the terms involving \\(c\\). So, does that mean the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just 6 times whatever the coefficient is in the second part for the term that doesn't involve \\(c\\)? Or maybe I'm overcomplicating it.\n\nWait, actually, when you multiply two expressions, each term in the first expression is multiplied by each term in the second. But since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), the only way \\(a^2b^2\\) can appear in the product is if we take the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part and multiply it by the constant term (the term with no \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\)) from the second part. Because if we take any term from the second part that has \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), then the resulting term would have \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2 \\cdot 1/c^k\\), which aren't just \\(a^2b^2\\). So, I think I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nSo, let me expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem as well. It would be \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying each term, that becomes \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m - m} = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\).\n\nI need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero because that's the constant term. So, set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\) so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\).\n\nSo, the constant term in the second expansion is 20. Therefore, when I multiply the two expansions together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the product of the coefficients from each part, which is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Wait, is that correct? Let me make sure I didn't miss anything.\n\nWait, so \\((a + b)^4\\) gives me a term \\(6a^2b^2\\), and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) gives me a term \\(20c^0\\), which is 20. So when I multiply them, I get \\(6 \\times 20 \\times a^2b^2 \\times c^0\\), which is \\(120a^2b^2\\). So, yes, the coefficient is 120.\n\nWait, but hold on a second. Is that the only way \\(a^2b^2\\) can appear? Let me think. If I take any other term from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), say a term with \\(c^k\\), then when I multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), I get \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), which isn't just \\(a^2b^2\\). So, only the constant term from the second expansion will contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. So, yes, 120 should be the correct coefficient.\n\nLet me just recap to make sure I didn't skip any steps. I expanded each part separately using the binomial theorem, found the coefficients for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and the constant term in the second part, then multiplied those coefficients together to get the final coefficient in the product. That seems right.\n\nWait, another thought: when I multiply two polynomials, each term is a product of terms from each polynomial. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is indeed the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second polynomial. So, yes, 6 times 20 is 120.\n\nI think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning. So, the coefficient should be 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break down the problem into two parts using the binomial theorem.\n\nFirst, consider the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\):\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^{k}\n\\]\nThe term \\(a^2b^2\\) occurs when \\(k = 2\\). The coefficient is:\n\\[\n\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\n\\]\n\nNext, consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):\n\\[\n\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n\\]\nThe constant term (where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero) occurs when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which gives \\(m = 3\\). The coefficient is:\n\\[\n\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\n\\]\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficients from each part:\n\\[\n6 \\times 20 = 120\n\\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}."

That makes me think I don't need to worry about the \\(c\\) terms because \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\). So maybe I can handle each part separately and then multiply the relevant coefficients together.\n\nLet me start with the first part: \\((a + b)^4\\). Using the binomial theorem, this expansion is the sum from \\(k = 0\\) to \\(4\\) of \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k} b^k\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be when \\(4 - k = 2\\), which means \\(k = 2\\). So, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\).

So, does that mean I can ignore the \\(c\\) terms? Or maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" Oh, I see, the entire expression is multiplied together, but we're only looking for the term that has \\(a^2b^2\\). Since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are in the first part, and \\(c\\) is in the second, when we multiply the two expansions together, the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms will multiply with the \\(c\\) terms, but since we're only interested in \\(a^2b^2\\), we can take the coefficient from the first part and multiply it by the sum of all coefficients from the second part. Because when we multiply, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will pair with every term from the second expansion, each contributing a coefficient, and since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), all those \\(c\\) terms will just be multiplied by the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part. Therefore, the total coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression will be the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients from the second part.\n\nWait, let me make sure I'm thinking about this correctly. The entire expression is a product of two polynomials. So, when you multiply them, each term from the first polynomial gets multiplied by each term from the second polynomial. But since we're only interested in the terms where the variables are \\(a^2b^2\\), and the second polynomial only has \\(c\\) terms, the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is by taking the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first polynomial and multiplying it by the entire second polynomial. So, the coefficient would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients from the second part.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Perhaps since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are all different variables, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part, because the second part doesn't affect \\(a\\) or \\(b\\). Wait, that might make more sense. Let me think again.\n\nIf I have \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), then when I expand both, each term in the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, a term like \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term from the second part, which are all powers of \\(c\\). But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then actually, the coefficient would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients from the second part, because each term in the second part contributes to the coefficient when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\).\n\nWait, but that doesn't seem right because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, which would include all possible combinations of \\(c\\) terms. But maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, meaning we can treat the entire second part as a single term. But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which would be the product of the coefficients from each part. Since the first part has a coefficient of 6 for \\(a^2b^2\\), and the second part, regardless of what it is, when multiplied by 6, would give the total coefficient. But that doesn't make sense because the second part is an expansion, not a single term. So, maybe I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, which would involve considering all the terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any term from the second expansion. But since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term from the first part, and the second part is a separate expansion, when you multiply them, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the entire second expansion. But that would mean the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion.\n\nWait, let me think differently. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). When you expand this, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, which are terms like \\(c^6\\), \\(6c^4\\), etc. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part (which is 6) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients from the second part. Because each term in the second part has a coefficient, and when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), it becomes part of the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2c^{...}\\). But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), we can sum all those contributions.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me see: The problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. Since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are in the first factor, and \\(c\\) is in the second, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term comes only from the first factor, and when multiplied by the entire second factor, each term in the second factor contributes to the coefficient. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first factor multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second factor.\n\nWait, but the second factor is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). The sum of all coefficients in this expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of all coefficients in the second factor is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 64 (sum of coefficients from the second part), which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nBut wait, let me check that. If I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = (1 + 1)^6 = 64\\), which is the sum of all coefficients. So, yes, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should think about it differently. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the first part, and when you multiply it by the entire second part, each term in the second part contributes to the coefficient. So, the coefficient is 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which is 64, giving 384.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. Another way to think about it is that the entire expression is the product of two polynomials. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the product of the coefficients of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial and the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial. Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second polynomial, each term contributes its coefficient to the overall coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^{...}\\), but since we're only interested in \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, we sum all those contributions. So, yes, that would be 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, which includes all possible powers of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient would be the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire second part, because each term in the second part is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of the second part. But that doesn't make sense because the expansion has multiple terms. Wait, no, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all coefficients in the second part, because each term in the second part contributes its coefficient when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\).\n\nWait, perhaps another approach: Let's expand both parts separately and then see how they multiply.\n\nFirst, \\((a + b)^4\\) expanded is \\(a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6.\n\nNow, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) can be expanded as \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\cdot c^{-m} = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). The coefficients here are \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\) for each term \\(c^{6 - 2m}\\).\n\nNow, when we multiply the two expansions together, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part (which is 6) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients from the second part, because each term in the second part contributes its coefficient when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\).\n\nAs I thought earlier, the sum of all coefficients in the second part is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, the total coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me confirm this with another approach. Suppose I don't consider the sum of all coefficients, but instead, think of the entire product as \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first part, and when multiplied by the entire second part, each term in the second part contributes to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. So, the coefficient is indeed 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which is 64, giving 384.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me think again. If I have two polynomials, P(a, b) and Q(c), then the product P(a, b) * Q(c) will have terms where each term of P is multiplied by each term of Q. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in P(a, b) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in Q(c). Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in Q(c), each term's coefficient adds to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. So, yes, that makes sense.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but just to be thorough, let me calculate the sum of the coefficients in the second part. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is:\n\n- \\(c^6\\) with coefficient 1,\n- \\(6c^4\\) with coefficient 6,\n- \\(15c^2\\) with coefficient 15,\n- \\(20c^0\\) (which is 20),\n- \\(15c^{-2}\\) with coefficient 15,\n- \\(6c^{-4}\\) with coefficient 6,\n- \\(c^{-6}\\) with coefficient 1.\n\nSo, the sum of all coefficients is 1 + 6 + 15 + 20 + 15 + 6 + 1 = 64. That checks out.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because sometimes when you have multiple variables, the coefficient might be different. But in this case, since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), and we're only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, it makes sense that it's 6 times the sum of the coefficients of the second part.\n\nSo, I think I'm confident that the coefficient is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is found by considering the binomial expansions of each part. The first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), has a coefficient of 6 for \\(a^2b^2\\). The second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), when expanded, has a sum of coefficients equal to 64. Multiplying these gives the final coefficient.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{384}"

But that might not be the case because the problem could be asking for the coefficient when considering all variables, but that seems unlikely. Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it, and the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, meaning that the \\(c\\) terms can be anything, so the coefficient is just the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).

Typically, when you're asked for the coefficient of a specific term in a product, you consider all possible terms, but in this case, \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the same as in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that can't be, because then the coefficient would be the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all coefficients from the second part, which would be a huge number. Wait, no, that's not correct because each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because each term in the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and the sum of all coefficients in the second part.\n\nWait, but let me check that. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^4 \\binom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\binom{4}{2} = 6\\). Then, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^6 \\binom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^6 \\binom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, when I multiply these two expansions together, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part, which are terms like \\(c^{6 - 2m}\\). Therefore, in the product, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all coefficients from the second part. Because each term in the second part has a coefficient, and when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), it contributes that coefficient to the product's \\(a^2b^2\\) term, but with different powers of \\(c\\). So, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then it's 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. Alternatively, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some specific \\(k\\), then it would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^k\\) in the second expansion. But the problem just says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", so I think it's the first case, where it's 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion.\n\nWait, but let me think again. The problem is written as \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), and it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, perhaps it's just the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of the second part, but that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion, which doesn't make sense because the expansion includes variables. Alternatively, maybe the problem is considering all terms, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. Let me calculate that.\n\nFirst, find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\). Using the binomial theorem, the coefficient is \\(\\binom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n\nNext, find the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). To find the sum of coefficients, we can substitute \\(c = 1\\). So, \\(\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\).\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\nWait, but that seems high. Let me check if that's correct. Alternatively, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem, and it's only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, considering that the other terms involve \\(c\\), but perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient when considering the product as a polynomial in \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\), and \\(1/c\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the same as in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of the second part. But that can't be, because that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, not a single number.\n\nWait, no, that's not right. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be a term that includes the coefficients from both expansions. Wait, no, actually, each term in the product is a product of a term from the first expansion and a term from the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, which are terms like \\(c^{6 - 2m}\\). Therefore, in the product, the term \\(a^2b^2c^{6 - 2m}\\) would have a coefficient of \\(\\binom{4}{2} \\times \\binom{6}{m}\\). So, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then it's the sum over all \\(m\\) of \\(\\binom{4}{2} \\times \\binom{6}{m}\\). But that would be \\(\\binom{4}{2} \\times \\sum_{m=0}^6 \\binom{6}{m}\\), which is 6 times 64, as I calculated earlier, which is 384.\n\nBut wait, that seems too large. Let me think again. Maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), that is, the term where the power of \\(c\\) is zero. So, that would be when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which implies \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient would be \\(\\binom{4}{2} \\times \\binom{6}{3}\\). Let me compute that.\n\n\\(\\binom{4}{2} = 6\\), and \\(\\binom{6}{3} = 20\\), so the coefficient would be \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nWait, that makes more sense. So, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\), which is 1. So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times 20, which is 120.\n\nBut the problem didn't specify the power of \\(c\\), so maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me read the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, it's just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). That would mean that the coefficient is the same as in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 times 64, which is 384.\n\nWait, but that seems too large because the second expansion has 7 terms, each with a coefficient, and when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), each of those coefficients would add up. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 times 64, which is 384.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the entire expression as a polynomial in \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\), and \\(1/c\\), and the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be a sum over all possible terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any power of \\(c\\). So, that would mean that the coefficient is indeed 384.\n\nBut let me check with a small example to see if that makes sense. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^1 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^1 = (a + b)(c + 1/c)\\). The coefficient of \\(a^1b^0\\) would be 1 times (1 + 1) = 2, because \\(c + 1/c\\) evaluated at \\(c=1\\) is 2. So, the coefficient of \\(a\\) would be 2. Similarly, the coefficient of \\(b\\) would also be 2. So, in that case, the coefficient of \\(a\\) is 1 times 2, which is 2. So, that seems to support the idea that the coefficient is the coefficient from the first part times the sum of coefficients from the second part.\n\nSimilarly, in the given problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the sum of coefficients in the second expansion is 64, so the total coefficient would be 6 times 64, which is 384.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem had specified a particular power of \\(c\\), say \\(c^0\\), then the coefficient would be 6 times \\(\\binom{6}{3}\\), which is 6 times 20, which is 120.\n\nWait, but the problem didn't specify any power of \\(c\\), so perhaps it's just 384. But I'm a bit confused because in the example I did, the coefficient of \\(a\\) was 2, which is the same as 1 times 2, so that seems to align with the idea that the coefficient is multiplied by the sum of coefficients from the second part.\n\nWait, but let me think again. When you have two polynomials multiplied together, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each polynomial. But in this case, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is only in the first polynomial, and the second polynomial doesn't have \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), so when you multiply, each term in the second polynomial is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial. Because each term in the second polynomial contributes its coefficient when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), each with coefficient 6 times the coefficient from the second polynomial. So, the total coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) across all possible \\(c^k\\) terms would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 6 times 64, which is 384.\n\nBut I'm still a bit unsure because sometimes problems ask for the coefficient of a specific term, considering all variables, but in this case, since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), I think it's correct to consider the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), which would be 384.\n\nWait, but let me think differently. Suppose I expand both expressions separately. The first expansion is \\((a + b)^4\\), which has terms up to \\(a^4\\) and \\(b^4\\). The second expansion is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which has terms from \\(c^6\\) down to \\(c^{-6}\\) in steps of 2. So, when I multiply these two, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. Therefore, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, which are \\(c^{6 - 2m}\\) with coefficients \\(\\binom{6}{m}\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^{6 - 2m}\\) in the product is \\(\\binom{4}{2}\\binom{6}{m}\\). Therefore, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then it's the sum over all \\(m\\) of \\(\\binom{4}{2}\\binom{6}{m}\\), which is 6 times 64, which is 384.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it's only when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), so \\(m = 3\\), and the coefficient is \\(\\binom{4}{2}\\binom{6}{3} = 6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nBut the problem didn't specify any power of \\(c\\), so I think it's the first case, 384. However, I'm a bit uncertain because sometimes problems like this expect you to consider the term where the exponents of all variables are specified, but in this case, only \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are specified. So, perhaps the answer is 120, assuming that the problem is implicitly asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). Alternatively, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of \\(c\\), which would be 384.\n\nWait, perhaps another way to look at it is that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, not a single number, which doesn't make sense. Therefore, I think the correct interpretation is that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), which would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 times 64, which is 384.\n\nBut to confirm, let me compute the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). The sum of coefficients is obtained by setting \\(c = 1\\), so \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\), as I thought earlier. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times 64, which is 384.\n\nWait, but let me think again. If I have \\((a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\), and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15c^{-2} + 6c^{-4} + c^{-6}\\). So, when I multiply these two, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), etc. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times each coefficient in the second expansion, but when you look for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), you have to consider all the terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any power of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 times 64, which is 384.\n\nBut I'm still a bit unsure because sometimes problems ask for the coefficient of a specific term with specific exponents, but in this case, it's only specifying \\(a^2b^2\\), not any \\(c\\) term. So, I think 384 is the correct answer.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is only considering the term where \\(c\\) cancels out, i.e., \\(c^0\\), so the coefficient would be 6 times 20, which is 120. But I'm not sure. Let me see if I can find any references or similar problems.\n\nWait, actually, in the problem statement, it's written as \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), and it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the same as in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Because when you multiply, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion.\n\nTherefore, I think the correct answer is 384.\n\nWait, but let me confirm with another approach. Suppose I consider the entire product as a product of two polynomials, one in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the other in \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial, because each term in the second polynomial is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), contributing its coefficient to the product's \\(a^2b^2\\) term. Therefore, the coefficient is 6 times 64, which is 384.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So, I think the answer is 384.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break down the problem as follows:\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^4 \\binom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\binom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n\n2. **Consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^6 \\binom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n   \\]\n   The sum of all coefficients in this expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\(2^6 = 64\\).\n\n3. **Determine the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product:**\n   Since each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient from the first expansion multiplied by the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion.\n\n   Therefore, the coefficient is:\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 64 = 384\n   \\]\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{384}\\)."

    "text": " Similarly, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) can also be expanded using the binomial theorem. But since I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), maybe I don't need to expand everything. Let me think.\n\nWait, so the entire expression is the product of two binomials raised to powers: \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But the term I'm looking for is \\(a^2b^2\\). Now, \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term that comes from the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\), right? Because when you expand \\((a + b)^4\\), you get terms like \\(a^4\\), \\(a^3b\\), \\(a^2b^2\\), etc. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is something I can find using the binomial coefficients.\n\nLet me recall the binomial theorem: \\((x + y)^n = \\sum_{k=0}^{n} \\dbinom{n}{k} x^{n - k} y^{k}\\). So, for \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\), since we're choosing 2 a's and 2 b's. Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\nBut wait, the original expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when we multiply these two expansions together, each term in the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. However, I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Now, does that term \\(a^2b^2\\) get multiplied by any terms from the second expansion? Let me see.\n\nSo, \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term from \\((a + b)^4\\), and when we multiply by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in that expansion is a power of c, like \\(c^6\\), \\(c^5\\), \\(c^4\\), etc., down to \\(c^{-6}\\). But since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve c, does that mean that when we multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by any term from the second expansion, it will just be \\(a^2b^2\\) times some power of c? But in the original problem, are we looking for a term that's only \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the c terms? Or is the problem asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, which would include all possible c terms?\n\nWait, actually, the problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, I think that means we need to consider the entire expansion, and find the coefficient for the term \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the c terms. So, in other words, we can treat the two expansions as separate and then find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) by considering how it interacts with the other expansion.\n\nWait, no, that might not be correct. Let me think again. When you multiply two expressions, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, which are powers of c. So, the resulting terms would be \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^5\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), etc., up to \\(a^2b^2c^{-6}\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, but \\(a^2b^2\\) alone, without any c terms? Because if we're looking for just \\(a^2b^2\\), then in the entire product, the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) is if we take \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part and then take the term that's 1 from the second part, because 1 times \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be \\(a^2b^2\\). But wait, does \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) have a term that's 1?\n\nLet me check. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) will have terms from \\(c^6\\) down to \\(c^{-6}\\). The general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, to get the term that's 1, we need \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which implies \\(k = 3\\). So, the term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} c^{0} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) (which is 1) in the second expansion is 20.\n\nTherefore, when we multiply the two expansions, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by 20 from the second part, resulting in \\(20a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 20 times the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion, which is 6. So, 20 * 6 = 120.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. Is there another way to approach this? Maybe by considering that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the product of the coefficients of \\(a^2b^2\\) in each part, assuming that the other part contributes a constant term. So, yes, that seems to be the case.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can think of it as the coefficient being the product of the coefficients of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Since \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\) with coefficient 6, and the constant term from the other expansion is 20, then the combined coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but let me verify if that's correct. Let me compute the expansions separately and see if that holds.\n\nFirst, \\((a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6.\n\nNow, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let's expand that. The general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, when k=0, it's \\(c^6\\), k=1, it's \\(6c^4\\), k=2, it's \\(15c^2\\), k=3, it's \\(20c^0 = 20\\), k=4, it's \\(15c^{-2}\\), k=5, it's \\(6c^{-4}\\), and k=6, it's \\(c^{-6}\\).\n\nSo, the constant term is indeed 20. Therefore, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by 20, giving 20a^2b^2. Therefore, the coefficient is 20 * 6 = 120.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Is there a possibility that other terms in the product could also contribute to \\(a^2b^2\\) when multiplied by terms from the second expansion? For example, if I take a term from the first expansion that's not \\(a^2b^2\\) and multiply it by a term from the second expansion that somehow cancels out the c terms to leave a constant, would that affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)?\n\nWait, no, because \\(a^2b^2\\) is only from the first expansion. The second expansion only contributes terms involving c and 1/c. So, unless the second expansion contributes a term that's 1 (i.e., c^0), then when you multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), you get \\(a^2b^2\\) times 1, which is just \\(a^2b^2\\). Any other term from the second expansion would introduce a c term, so it wouldn't contribute to the \\(a^2b^2\\) term unless it's multiplied by something else. But since \\(a^2b^2\\) is only from the first expansion, the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is to take \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first and 1 from the second. Therefore, the coefficient is indeed 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not missing something. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^4\\) times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). When I expand this, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second. So, for example, \\(a^4\\) from the first expansion would be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, giving terms like \\(a^4c^6\\), \\(a^4c^5\\), etc. Similarly, \\(a^3b\\) from the first would be multiplied by each term in the second, giving terms like \\(a^3bc^6\\), \\(a^3bc^5\\), etc.\n\nBut when we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), we have to find all the ways that \\(a^2b^2\\) can appear in the product. Since \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the first expansion, and the second expansion's terms involve c, unless we have a term in the second expansion that is 1, we can't get \\(a^2b^2\\) without any c terms. So, the only way is to take \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion and multiply it by the constant term 20 from the second expansion, resulting in 20a^2b^2. Therefore, the coefficient is 20 * 6 = 120.\n\nWait, but perhaps another way to think about it is that since the two expansions are independent, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is just the product of the coefficients of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion. So, 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nI think that's correct. Let me just check by considering a simpler example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, expanding, the first part is \\(a^2 + 2ab + b^2\\), and the second part is \\(c + 1/c\\). So, the product would be \\(a^2c + a^2/c + 2abc + 2ab/c + b^2c + b^2/c\\). Now, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in this product is zero because none of the terms have both \\(a^2\\) and \\(b^2\\) unless we have higher powers, but in this case, the first expansion only goes up to \\(b^2\\), and the second expansion is only to the first power. Wait, maybe this example isn't the best.\n\nWait, perhaps another example: \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^2\\). The first expansion is \\(a^2 + 2ab + b^2\\), the second is \\(c^2 + 2c*(1/c) + (1/c)^2 = c^2 + 2 + 1/c^2\\). Now, if I multiply them, the term \\(a^2\\) from the first expansion times 2 from the second gives \\(2a^2\\), the term \\(2ab\\) times 2 gives \\(4ab\\), and \\(b^2\\) times 2 gives \\(2b^2\\). But wait, no, that's not correct because each term is multiplied by each term. So, actually, the product would be:\n\n\\(a^2c^2 + a^2*2 + a^2*(1/c^2) + 2ab*c^2 + 2ab*2 + 2ab*(1/c^2) + b^2c^2 + b^2*2 + b^2*(1/c^2)\\).\n\nSo, in this product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't appear because the first expansion only has up to \\(b^2\\), and the second expansion doesn't have a term that would contribute \\(b^2\\). So, in this case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is zero because there's no way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product.\n\nWait, but in our original problem, the first expansion is \\((a + b)^4\\), which does have \\(a^2b^2\\), and the second expansion is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which has a constant term. So, in that case, the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nI think I'm confident now that the coefficient is 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem for each part.\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k} b^{k}\n   \\]\n   The term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\), so the coefficient is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\n   \\]\n\n2. **Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n   \\]\n   The constant term (where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0) occurs when \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\). The coefficient is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\n   \\]\n\n3. **Combine the results:**\n   The term \\(a^2b^2\\) from \\((a + b)^4\\) with coefficient 6 is multiplied by the constant term 20 from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is:\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 20 = 120\n   \\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

    "text": " The binomial theorem says that \\((a + b)^n = \\sum_{k=0}^{n} \\dbinom{n}{k} a^{n - k} b^k\\). So, maybe I can apply that here.\n\nLet me start by expanding \\((a + b)^4\\). Using the binomial theorem, this would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{0}a^4 + \\dbinom{4}{1}a^3b + \\dbinom{4}{2}a^2b^2 + \\dbinom{4}{3}ab^3 + \\dbinom{4}{4}b^4\\). Calculating the coefficients, that becomes \\(1 \\cdot a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + 1b^4\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in this part is 6. Okay, that's straightforward.\n\nNow, the other part of the expression is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I also need to expand this using the binomial theorem. Let me write that out. It would be \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k\\). Simplifying the exponents, that becomes \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} c^{-k}\\) which is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\).\n\nSo, the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{0}c^6 + \\dbinom{6}{1}c^4 + \\dbinom{6}{2}c^2 + \\dbinom{6}{3}c^0 + \\dbinom{6}{4}c^{-2} + \\dbinom{6}{5}c^{-4} + \\dbinom{6}{6}c^{-6}\\). Calculating the coefficients, that's \\(1c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20c^0 + 15c^{-2} + 6c^{-4} + 1c^{-6}\\). So, the coefficients are 1, 6, 15, 20, 15, 6, 1 for the respective powers of c.\n\nNow, the original expression is the product of these two expansions: \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I need to consider how multiplying these two expansions works. Specifically, I'm looking for terms in the product where the exponents of a and b are 2 and 2 respectively. Since the second part of the expression only involves c and 1/c, which are separate variables, the exponents of a and b will only come from the first part, right?\n\nWait, that might not be entirely accurate. Let me think again. When you multiply two expressions, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which only involves a and b, the multiplication by terms involving c won't affect the exponents of a and b. That means each term in the second expansion will just scale the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) by their respective coefficients.\n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, each term contributes its coefficient times \\(a^2b^2\\), so all those contributions add up.\n\nWait, is that correct? Let me verify. So, the first part is \\((a + b)^4\\), which gives \\(6a^2b^2\\). The second part is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which when expanded, has terms with coefficients 1, 6, 15, 20, 15, 6, 1. So, when we multiply \\(6a^2b^2\\) by each of these terms, each term will contribute to the overall expression as \\(6a^2b^2 \\times\\) (each term from the second expansion). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve c or 1/c, the other variables won't affect it. So, each of these terms from the second expansion will just add their coefficients multiplied by 6 to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\).\n\nWait, but no, that's not quite right. Because when you multiply two expressions, the exponents add. So, for example, \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^6\\) would give \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), which is a different term. Similarly, \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^4\\) is \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), and so on. So, actually, \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by any term in the second expansion will result in a term that includes both a^2b^2 and some power of c. Therefore, in the entire product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will only appear once, but multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. Wait, no, that's not correct either because each term in the product will have exponents from both expressions. So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the exponents of c, then I need to consider all the terms where a and b are squared, but c can be any power.\n\nWait, but actually, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but it doesn't specify any particular exponent for c. So, does that mean we're considering all possible exponents of c? But that would make the coefficient the sum over all coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by the coefficient from the first expansion. But that seems a bit off because the problem is phrased as \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", without mentioning c, so perhaps it's considering the coefficient when multiplied by any power of c. But that doesn't quite make sense because each term in the product will have both a^2b^2 and some power of c.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression. So, when you expand the product \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in the expansion will be of the form \\((a^kb^{4 - k}) \\times (c^{6 - 2m}c^{-m})\\), but wait, no, more accurately, each term from the first expansion is \\(a^kb^{4 - k}\\) and each term from the second is \\(c^{6 - 2m}\\), as we saw earlier. So, when you multiply them, you get terms like \\(a^kb^{4 - k}c^{6 - 2m}\\).\n\nBut the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the exponent on c. So, in other words, we're looking for all terms where the exponents of a and b are 2 and 2 respectively, and the exponent on c can be anything. Therefore, the coefficient would be the sum of the coefficients from the first expansion for \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by each coefficient from the second expansion, because each term in the second expansion, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), will contribute to the overall coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^{n}\\), but since the problem doesn't specify c, we're considering the coefficient across all powers of c.\n\nWait, but that would mean the coefficient is the product of the coefficients from each part. So, the coefficient from \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, and the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion is 1 + 6 + 15 + 20 + 15 + 6 + 1 = 64. So, then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 * 64 = 384. But that seems too high. Let me check my reasoning again.\n\nWait, no, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. The problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", but in the entire expression, each term is a product of a term from the first expansion and a term from the second. So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), it's only the coefficient from the first expansion, because the second expansion doesn't involve a or b. So, actually, when you multiply \\(6a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, you get terms like \\(6a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(6a^2b^2c^4\\), etc., but each of these has a different exponent on c. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would actually be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, because each term in the second expansion contributes to a term where a and b are squared, but with different c exponents.\n\nBut wait, if the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), without considering c, then perhaps it's considering the term \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of c. So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * (1 + 6 + 15 + 20 + 15 + 6 + 1) = 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nBut wait, that seems a bit off because the problem might be expecting a different approach. Let me think again. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., \\(a^2b^2\\) times c to the zero power, which would be a constant term. That would make more sense because otherwise, the coefficient would involve all possible powers of c, which might not be intended.\n\nIf that's the case, then we need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product. So, in that case, we need to find terms where in the first expansion, we have \\(a^2b^2\\), and in the second expansion, we have \\(c^0\\). So, the coefficient from the first part is 6, and the coefficient from the second part where c^0 is 20. So, the total coefficient would be 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, that seems more reasonable. Let me check: in the second expansion, the term with c^0 is when the exponent is 0, which occurs when 6 - 2m = 0, so m = 3. So, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, yes, that makes sense. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nBut the problem didn't specify c^0, it just said \\(a^2b^2\\). So, perhaps I should clarify. If the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of c, then it's 6 * 64 = 384. But if it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it's 120.\n\nWait, let me look at the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" It doesn't specify any exponent for c, so perhaps it's considering the coefficient when multiplied by any power of c. But that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nBut I'm a bit confused because in the product, each term will have both a and b exponents and c exponents. So, if we're only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), without considering c, then technically, the coefficient would be 6 times the entire second expansion, which is a generating function in c. But that doesn't make much sense because the coefficient would then be a polynomial in c, not a single number.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is intended to consider the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, treating c as another variable, but not necessarily setting it to any specific power. But that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the entire second expansion, which is \\(6 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that's not a single coefficient; it's a polynomial in c.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is intended to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by the constant term in c. So, that would be \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be 6 * 20 = 120. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of c, which would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, let me think again. If I expand \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) separately, then the product is the sum over all possible combinations of terms from each expansion. So, each term in the product is \\(a^kb^{4 - k}c^{6 - 2m}\\) where k ranges from 0 to 4 and m ranges from 0 to 6. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the sum over all terms where k=2, so that a^2b^2, and m can be anything, because c can be any exponent. So, the coefficient would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) times the sum over m of \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\). Wait, but no, because in the second expansion, the exponent is 6 - 2m, so m is the index variable. Actually, the second expansion is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\), so the coefficient of \\(c^{n}\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\) where n = 6 - 2m.\n\nBut if we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the exponent on c, then we just take the coefficient from the first expansion, which is 6, and multiply it by the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. The sum of all coefficients in the second expansion is found by setting c = 1, which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of coefficients is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nBut wait, that seems high. Let me verify with a smaller example. Suppose we have \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Expanding, we get \\((a^2 + 2ab + b^2) \\times (c + 1/c)\\). The coefficient of \\(a^2\\) would be 1 * (1 + 1) = 2, which is correct because the terms would be \\(a^2c\\) and \\(a^2/c\\), each with coefficient 1, so total coefficient for \\(a^2\\) across all c exponents is 2.\n\nSimilarly, if we have \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^2\\), which expands to \\((a^2 + 2ab + b^2) \\times (c^2 + 2c^0 + c^{-2})\\). The coefficient of \\(ab\\) would be 2 * (1 + 2 + 1) = 8, because each term in the second expansion scales the 2ab term. So, that seems to support the idea that the coefficient is the product of the individual coefficients.\n\nTherefore, in the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me think again. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but in the product, each term is a combination of a, b, and c exponents. So, if we're only considering \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the c exponent, then the coefficient is indeed 6 * 64 = 384. But if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it's 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nI think the confusion arises from whether the problem is considering the term \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of c or specifically \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). Since the problem doesn't specify, it's ambiguous, but in the context of such problems, usually, when only a and b are specified, it's implied that we're considering the coefficient across all possible exponents of c. Therefore, I think the answer is 384.\n\nBut wait, let me check another angle. If I expand the entire expression, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by each term from the second expansion, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), etc. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the sum of all these coefficients, which is 6 * (1 + 6 + 15 + 20 + 15 + 6 + 1) = 6 * 64 = 384. So, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, if I were to collect like terms, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion, which is 64, giving 384.\n\nTherefore, after considering all this, I think the coefficient is 384.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it might be 120 if considering \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), but the problem doesn't specify c, so I think 384 is the correct answer.\n\nWait, but let me make sure. Let's think about how the multiplication works. When you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, for each term in the first polynomial, you get a term in the product. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), etc. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the sum of the coefficients of all these terms. So, the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 64. Therefore, 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So, I think the answer is 384.\n\nBut wait, just to double-check, let me compute the sum of coefficients in the second expansion. The second expansion is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). The sum of coefficients is found by setting c = 1, which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, that's correct. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, if I were to compute the entire product and look for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), it would involve summing over all possible exponents of c, which is exactly what we've done.\n\nSo, after all this thinking, I believe the coefficient is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6. Next, the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is calculated by setting \\(c = 1\\), resulting in \\(64\\). Multiplying these together gives \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\boxed{384}."

Let me think about that. \n\nWhen you multiply two expressions together, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression.

But that seems unlikely. Maybe I should just focus on the part involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) and realize that the other part doesn't affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). \n\nWait, no. Let me think again. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). When you expand this, each term will be of the form (term from first expansion) multiplied by (term from second expansion).

That is, perhaps the \\(c\\) terms are separate and the coefficient is just the coefficient from the first part. But that seems too simple.

But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so perhaps it's only considering the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, meaning the constant term from the second expansion. So, the coefficient would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part. \n\nYes, that makes sense. So, to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and multiply it by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). \n\nOkay, let's start with the first part: the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\). Using the binomial theorem, the expansion is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^4 \\binom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\\). So, the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is when \\(4 - k = 2\\), so \\(k = 2\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(\\binom{4}{2}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\binom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\\). \n\nNow, moving on to the second part: \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\), which is the constant term. To do this, I'll expand using the binomial theorem again. The expansion is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^6 \\binom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(1/c\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^6 \\binom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). \n\nWe want the exponent of \\(c\\) to be zero, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which gives \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(\\binom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\binom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). \n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. \n\nNow, putting it all together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the two coefficients we found: \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). \n\nWait, but let me double-check. The first part gives 6, the second part gives 20, so 6 times 20 is indeed 120. \n\nAlternatively, I can think of the entire expression as \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). When expanded, each term will be of the form \\(\\binom{4}{k}a^{4 - k}b^k \\times \\binom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\) in the first part, and in the second part, we need \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(\\binom{4}{2} \\times \\binom{6}{3} = 6 \\times 20 = 120\\). \n\nYes, that seems correct. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break down the problem into two parts:\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\)** using the binomial theorem:\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^4 \\binom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\), so the coefficient is:\n   \\[\n   \\binom{4}{2} = 6\n   \\]\n\n2. **Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)** using the binomial theorem:\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^6 \\binom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^6 \\binom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n   \\]\n   The constant term (where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0) occurs when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which gives \\(m = 3\\). The coefficient is:\n   \\[\n   \\binom{6}{3} = 20\n   \\]\n\n3. **Multiply the coefficients** from both parts:\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 20 = 120\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."
