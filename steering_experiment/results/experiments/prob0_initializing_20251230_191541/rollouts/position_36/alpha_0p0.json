Hence, the coefficient is indeed 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of it as treating \\(c + 1/c\\) as a separate variable, but I don't think that's necessary here.

Wait, let me just make sure I didn't miss anything here. Is there a possibility that other terms from the second polynomial could contribute to the \\(a^2b^2\\) term? For example, if I take a term with \\(c^1\\) from the second polynomial and multiply it by a term without \\(c\\), would that affect the \\(a^2b^2\\) term? Hmm, no, because the \\(a^2b^2\\) term doesn't have any \\(c\\) in it. So, any term that includes a \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\) would result in a term that has \\(c\\) raised to some power, which is not what we're looking for.

Therefore, the coefficient is 120. Wait, but just to double-check, let me think about the entire expansion. The first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), when expanded, gives terms like \\(a^4\\), \\(4a^3b\\), \\(6a^2b^2\\), \\(4ab^3\\), and \\(b^4\\). The second part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), when expanded, gives terms from \\(c^6\\) down to \\(1/c^6\\), with various coefficients. When we multiply these two expansions together, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first expansion is \\(6a^2b^2\\).

Now, going back to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the two coefficients we found. That is, 6 (from \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\)) multiplied by 20 (from \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)). So, 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 120. Wait, let me double-check that. So, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6. And in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. So, when you multiply these two polynomials together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. But since we're only interested in the term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), that's the \\(c^0\\) term, which has a coefficient of 20. So, 6 * 20 is 120. Yeah, that seems right.
