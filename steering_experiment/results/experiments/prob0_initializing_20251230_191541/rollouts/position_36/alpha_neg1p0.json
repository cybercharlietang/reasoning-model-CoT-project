    "text": " Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Now, going back to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the other polynomial is 20. Since these two terms are multiplied together in the product, the overall coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) (ignoring the \\(c\\) terms) is 6 * 20 = 120. Wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake here. So, when we multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since we're only interested in the term that has \\(a^2b^2\\), which comes from the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first polynomial and the constant term (c^0) in the second polynomial, the coefficient is indeed the product of the two coefficients. So, 6 * 20 is 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my steps to make sure I didn't miss anything. First, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). That seems correct. Then, in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the expansion is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, setting \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), we get \\(m = 3\\), and the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, yes, that's correct. Therefore, multiplying 6 and 20 gives 120. So, the coefficient is 120. I think that's right. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning.\n\nWait, another way to think about it: when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each polynomial. So, in this case, since we're looking for \\(a^2b^2\\), which comes from the first part, and \\(c^0\\), which comes from the second part, their product will give the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression. So, yes, that's consistent with what I did before. So, I think 120 is the correct answer.\n\nJust to make sure, let me consider a simpler case. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Let's compute the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in that case. Wait, no, that's not possible because \\((a + b)^2\\) only goes up to \\(a^2b^0\\) and \\(a^0b^2\\), so \\(a^2b^2\\) would require a higher power. Maybe a better example: \\((a + b)^3 \\times (c + 1/c)^3\\). Let's say I want the coefficient of \\(a^2b^1c^0\\). In \\((a + b)^3\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^1\\) is \\(\\dbinom{3}{1} = 3\\). In \\((c + 1/c)^3\\), the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{3}{1} = 3\\) because \\(3 - 2m = 0\\) gives \\(m = 1.5\\), wait, that's not an integer. Wait, maybe my example is bad. Let me pick a better one. Let's take \\((a + b)^4 \\times (c + 1/c)^6\\), which is the original problem. Wait, that's the same as the problem, so maybe that's not helpful. Alternatively, let me take \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^2\\). Let's compute the coefficient of \\(a^2b^0c^0\\). In \\((a + b)^2\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^0\\) is 1. In \\((c + 1/c)^2\\), the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{2}{1} = 2\\). So, the coefficient in the product would be 1 * 2 = 2. Let me check by expanding: \\((a + b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2\\). \\((c + 1/c)^2 = c^2 + 2 + 1/c^2\\). Multiplying these together, the term \\(a^2\\) from the first would multiply 2 (the constant term) to give 2a^2, which matches. So, that works. So, that example checks out. Therefore, my method is correct, and the coefficient is indeed 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem.\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\):\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\n   \\]\n   So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\n2. **Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n   \\]\n   We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0:\n   \\[\n   6 - 2m = 0 \\implies m = 3\n   \\]\n   The coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\n   \\]\n\n3. **Multiply the coefficients:**\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20.

So, 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120.\n\nWait, let me double-check that. So, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6 because \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Then, in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, when you multiply these two parts together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part multiplies the constant term from the second part, giving \\(6 * 20 = 120\\). That seems correct. I don't think I made any mistakes here. So, the final answer should be 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Multiplying these together gives 6 * 20 = 120.\n\n\\boxed{120}"
