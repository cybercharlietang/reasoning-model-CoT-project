Wait, let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. Is there a possibility that other terms could contribute to \\(a^2b^2\\)? For example, could a term with \\(c\\) in the second polynomial somehow combine with a term in the first polynomial to give \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms? Hmm, no, because if you take any term from the second polynomial that has a \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\) in it, when you multiply it by any term from the first polynomial, the result will have a \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\) term. Therefore, the only way to get a term without any \\(c\\) terms is to multiply the constant term (the term with \\(c^0\\)) from the second polynomial by the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first polynomial.

    "text": " Let me compute that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Now, going back to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the two coefficients I found. That is, 6 (from the \\(a^2b^2\\) term) multiplied by 20 (from the \\(c^0\\) term). So, 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 120.\n\nWait, let me just double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. First, I expanded \\((a + b)^4\\) and correctly found the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) as 6. Then, I considered the second part \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) and realized that to get a term without \\(c\\), I needed the term where the exponents cancel out, which happens when the exponent is 0. I set up the equation \\(6 - 2m = 0\\) and found \\(m = 3\\), which is correct. Then, I calculated \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\) as 20, which is right. Multiplying 6 and 20 gives 120, so that seems correct. I don't think I made any errors here.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think about it another way to confirm. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). If I were to multiply these out, each term in the first expansion would multiply each term in the second. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), we only need the part of the second expansion that's a constant (i.e., \\(c^0\\)). So, that's exactly what I did. So, yeah, 6 times 20 is 120. I think that's solid.\n\nJust to make sure, let me write out the expansions more explicitly. For \\((a + b)^4\\), the expansion is \\(a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). So, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term is indeed 6. For \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the expansion is \\(c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15/c^2 + 6/c^4 + 1/c^6\\). So, the constant term is 20. Multiplying these two expansions together, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first expansion would multiply each term in the second expansion. But since we're only interested in the constant term (i.e., the term without \\(c\\)), we only take the 20 and multiply it by 6, giving 120. So, that's consistent with what I found earlier. I think that's correct.\n\nWait a second, just to be absolutely thorough, is there any other term in the second expansion that could contribute to the \\(a^2b^2\\) term when multiplied by something else? For example, if I take a term with \\(c^k\\) and multiply it by a term with \\(c^{-k}\\), would that affect the \\(a^2b^2\\) term? Hmm, but no, because the \\(a^2b^2\\) term is independent of \\(c\\). So, when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by any term in the second expansion, you'll get a term like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2/c^k\\), but the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) itself (without any \\(c\\) terms) is only affected by the constant term in the second expansion. So, I think my reasoning is correct. Therefore, the coefficient is indeed 120.\n\nI don't see any mistakes in my calculations or logic, so I'm confident that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem.\n\nFirst, we expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n\\]\nWe need the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2, which corresponds to \\(k = 2\\). The coefficient is:\n\\[\n\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\n\\]\n\nNext, we consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem:\n\\[\n\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n\\]\nWe need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so we solve \\(6 - 2m = 0\\) to find \\(m = 3\\).
