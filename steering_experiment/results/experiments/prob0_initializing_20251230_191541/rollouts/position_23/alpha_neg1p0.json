Again, using the binomial theorem, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying that, it's \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m} = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, each term has an exponent of \\(6 - 2m\\). We need the term where the exponent is 0, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Let's solve for \\(m\\): \\(6 - 2m = 0\\) \u2192 \\(2m = 6\\) \u2192 \\(m = 3\\). So, the term where \\(m = 3\\) is the one with \\(c^0\\). The coefficient for that term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part is 20. Now, since the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from multiplying the \\(a^2b^2\\) term (coefficient 6) by the \\(c^0\\) term (coefficient 20), the overall coefficient in the entire expression is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Wait, but let me make sure I didn't miss anything. Is there a possibility that other terms in the second expansion could contribute to the \\(a^2b^2\\) term? For example, if I have a term like \\(c^1\\) multiplied by \\(a^2b^2c^{-1}\\), that would also give \\(a^2b^2\\), but in our case, the second expansion is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), so each term is either a positive power of \\(c\\) or a negative power. But when we multiply by \\((a + b)^4\\), each term in the first expansion is a product of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms, and each term in the second expansion is a product of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) terms. So, for the product to have a term with \\(a^2b^2\\), it must come from multiplying \\(a^2b^2\\) by a term in the second expansion that has \\(c^0\\), because any other power of \\(c\\) would result in \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), which is not \\(a^2b^2\\) unless \\(k = 0\\).

Well, no, because any term from the second polynomial would have some power of \\(c\\), unless it's the constant term. So, only the constant term in the second polynomial, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), would result in a term that's just \\(a^2b^2\\).

Now, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Again, I can use the binomial theorem for this. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying each term, that becomes \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m - m} = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so we set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Let me compute that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Now, since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, which is the product of \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will come from multiplying the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first part by the \\(c^0\\) term in the second part. Therefore, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Wait, is that all? Let me double-check. So, in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, and in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the constant term is 20. So when we multiply these two parts together, each term in the first polynomial multiplies each term in the second. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), we only need the constant term from the second polynomial. So, yes, 6 times 20 is 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120. I think that makes sense. Let me just make sure I didn't miss anything. The problem is about the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so any terms involving \\(c\\) wouldn't affect that coefficient unless they multiplied into \\(a^2b^2\\), but since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), their coefficients are independent. So, yes, the coefficient is 120.

Therefore, going back to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the two coefficients I found: 6 (from \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\)) and 20 (from \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)). So, 6 multiplied by 20 is 120. Therefore, the coefficient is 120. Wait, let me double-check that. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\) with coefficient 6, and it's multiplied by every term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since we're only interested in \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), the only term that would contribute is the one where the \\(c\\) terms cancel out, which is the constant term, which we found to be 20. So, 6 times 20 is indeed 120. Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe I can think of it as the entire product being the product of two expansions, and the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would come from choosing \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part and any term from the second part, but since we don't care about the \\(c\\) terms, the coefficient would just be 6 times the sum over all terms in the second part, but no, that's not right because we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. Wait, actually, no. When you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum of the products of the coefficients of terms whose exponents add up to that term. But in this case, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), so in the product, \\(a^2b^2\\) can only come from multiplying \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first polynomial by a term in the second polynomial that has \\(c^0\\), because any other term would introduce \\(c\\) exponents, which would make the product term have \\(c\\) terms, but since we're only looking for \\(a^2b^2\\), the \\(c\\) part must be zero.

Let me check that reasoning again. So, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When I expand both, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But since we're only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), we need to consider how many times \\(a^2b^2\\) appears in the product. That is, it will only appear once, multiplied by each term from the second expansion. But wait, no, that's not correct. Because \\(a^2b^2\\) is just a single term, and when multiplied by the second expansion, each term in the second expansion will give a different term in the product. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, that doesn't sound right either. Maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think again. The problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) can only come from multiplying \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part by any term from the second part. But since the second part is in terms of \\(c\\), which is separate from \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will just have a coefficient equal to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that can't be, because then the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\), but the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term without any \\(c\\) dependence. So, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some \\(k\\), but no, the question is just \\(a^2b^2\\). Hmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Wait, the problem is written as \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when you expand this, the terms will involve products of powers of \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\), and \\(1/c\\). So, to get a term with only \\(a^2b^2\\), we need to have the product of \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part and a term that has \\(c^0\\) from the second part, because \\(c^0 = 1\\), so it won't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). That makes sense because any other term in the second expansion would introduce a \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\) term, which would make the term in the product have \\(c\\) dependence, but since we're only looking for \\(a^2b^2\\), we need the term where the \\(c\\) exponent is zero. So, first, I found that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. Now, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me work on that. The expression \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) can be expanded using the binomial theorem as well. The general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, the exponent of \\(c\\) in each term is \\(6 - 2k\\). We want the term where the exponent is zero, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Now, going back to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the two coefficients we found: 6 and 20. So, 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120. Wait, let me just double-check that I didn't make any mistakes in my calculations. So, for \\((a + b)^4\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed when \\(k=2\\), so \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). For \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term with \\(c^0\\) is when \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), so \\(k=3\\), and \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying 6 and 20 gives 120. That seems correct.

Therefore, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be the product of the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first polynomial and the constant term from the second polynomial. So, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Wait, that seems straightforward, but let me make sure I'm not missing anything. So, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). When expanding, each term from \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term comes from the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and the term that's a constant (i.e., \\(c^0\\)) in the second part. Since the second part's constant term is 20, as I found, then the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is indeed \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Let me just think if there's another way this could be approached. Alternatively, maybe I can consider that the entire expression is a product of two independent expansions, so when I multiply them, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) would be the product of the coefficients of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and \\(c^0\\) in the second part. So, that would again be 6 times 20, which is 120. So, that seems consistent. I don't think I'm missing any cross terms or anything because \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), so it can't come from any other terms except those where the \\(c\\) parts cancel out to give a constant. Therefore, I think the coefficient is 120. I can't see any mistakes in my reasoning, so I think that's the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression is found by considering the binomial expansions of each part separately and then combining the relevant coefficients.\n\n1.

So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). That makes sense because when you multiply the two polynomials together, the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) is by multiplying the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part and the term with \\(c^0\\) (which is a constant) from the second part. So, now I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Again, I can use the binomial theorem for this. Let me write it out: \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying that, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m} = \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). I need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be 0, so I set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). So, the term where \\(m = 3\\) is the constant term. The coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\).

Then, in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the constant term is 20. So, when I multiply these two, I get 6 * 20 = 120. That seems right. But maybe I should double-check the binomial coefficients. For \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\), that's 6, which is correct. For \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\), that's 20, which is also correct. So, 6 * 20 is indeed 120. Hmm, another way to think about it is, when you have two polynomials multiplied together, the coefficient of a specific term is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each polynomial. Since \\(a^2b^2\\) only comes from the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first part and the constant term in the second part, that should be the only contribution. So, yes, 120 is the correct coefficient.

Because \\(c^0\\) is the constant term. So, I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me calculate that. Using the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the exponent of \\(c\\) in each term is \\(6 - 2m\\). We need the term where the exponent is 0, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} c^{0} = \\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the two coefficients: 6 (from \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\)) multiplied by 20 (from the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)). So, 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient is 120. Let me just double-check to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. First, the binomial coefficient for \\((a + b)^4\\) at \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Then, for \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the constant term occurs when \\(m = 3\\), which gives \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying them together gives 6 * 20 = 120. That seems correct. I don't think I missed anything here. So, yeah, the coefficient is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is found by considering the expansion of each part separately. From \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). The constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying these gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\boxed{120}"

    "text": " So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). That makes sense because any other term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) would introduce a \\(c\\) term, which wouldn't be present in \\(a^2b^2\\). So, first, I found that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. Now, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me think about how to expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Again, using the binomial theorem, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying that, each term becomes \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m} = \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the exponent of \\(c\\) in each term is \\(6 - 2m\\). We need the term where the exponent is 0, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the term where \\(m = 3\\) is the one with \\(c^0\\). The coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Now, going back to the original expression, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the product of the two coefficients I found: 6 (from \\((a + b)^4\\)) and 20 (from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)). So, 6 multiplied by 20 is 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120. Wait, let me double-check that. So, \\((a + b)^4\\) gives 6 for \\(a^2b^2\\), and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) gives 20 for the constant term. Multiplying them together gives 6 * 20 = 120. That seems right. Alternatively, maybe I can think of the entire expression as a product of two expansions and see if any other terms could contribute to \\(a^2b^2\\). But since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are only in the first part, and \\(c\\) is only in the second, the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) is by taking \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first and the constant term from the second. So, yes, 120 is the correct coefficient. I think that's it.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break down the problem into two parts.\n\n1. **Expanding \\((a + b)^4\\):**\n   Using the binomial theorem, the expansion is:\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\), so the coefficient is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\n   \\]\n\n2. **Expanding \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   Using the binomial theorem, the expansion is:\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n   \\]\n   We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0:\n   \\[\n   6 - 2m = 0 \\implies m = 3\n   \\]\n   The coefficient is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\n   \\]\n\n3. **Combining the coefficients:**\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the product of the two coefficients:\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 20 = 120\n   \\]\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."
