    "text": " So, I think the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part. That makes sense because when you multiply them together, you get \\(a^2b^2 \\times c^0 = a^2b^2\\). So, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me figure that out. Again, using the binomial theorem, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). I need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient from the second part is 20. Now, since the two coefficients are multiplied together in the product, the overall coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Wait, let me just check that again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. So, the first part gives 6, the second part gives 20, so 6 * 20 is indeed 120. Is there any other consideration I need to make? Hmm, maybe I should think about whether the exponents of \\(c\\) could affect the term \\(a^2b^2\\). But since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), any term that includes \\(c\\) wouldn't contribute to \\(a^2b^2\\). So, only the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0 would contribute. Therefore, I think 120 is the correct coefficient. So, putting it all together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is 120.\n\nWait, hold on, let me make sure I didn't overlook anything. So, in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. In the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. When you multiply these two expansions together, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part. But since we're only interested in \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), we only consider the term where the second part is 1 (i.e., \\(c^0\\)). Therefore, the coefficient is indeed 6 * 20 = 120. I think that's correct. So, yeah, the coefficient is 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we start by expanding each part separately using the binomial theorem.\n\nFirst, consider the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\):\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n\\]\nWe need the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which corresponds to \\(k = 2\\):\n\\[\n\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\n\\]\n\nNext, consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):\n\\[\n\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n\\]\nWe need the coefficient of \\(c^0\\), which corresponds to \\(6 - 2m = 0\\) or \\(m = 3\\):\n\\[\n\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\n\\]\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficients from each part:\n\\[\n6 \\times 20 = 120\n\\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}."

Then, the product will give me the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression because when I multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by \\(c^0\\), I just get \\(a^2b^2\\), and the other terms would involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), which aren't part of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, my next task is to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me think about how to do that. Again, I can use the binomial theorem for this. So, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying each term, that becomes \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m - m} = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). Now, I need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, because \\(c^0 = 1\\), which is the constant term. So, I need to solve for \\(m\\) in the equation \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Let me solve that: \\(6 - 2m = 0\\) implies \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). So, the term where \\(m = 3\\) will be the constant term. The coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Now, going back to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Therefore, when we multiply these two expressions together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) (since we're multiplying by \\(c^0\\), which doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms) will be \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Wait, is that all? Let me double-check to make sure I didn't miss anything. So, \\((a + b)^4\\) gives me 6 for \\(a^2b^2\\), and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) gives me 20 for \\(c^0\\). Multiplying them together, 6 times 20 is indeed 120. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120. I don't think I made any mistakes here, but let me just go through it again quickly. When expanding \\((a + b)^4\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is at \\(k = 2\\), which gives 6.

Let me confirm that. So, when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).

That makes sense because when you multiply the two expressions, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will be multiplied by each term in the second expression, but only the term with \\(c^0\\) will contribute to a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), which is what we're interested in. So, first, I found that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. Now, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).

Let me compute that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Now, going back to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is the product of the two coefficients we found. That is, 6 (from \\(a^2b^2\\)) multiplied by 20 (from \\(c^0\\)), which gives 6 * 20 = 120. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120. Wait, let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes here. Let me double-check each step. First, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Then, in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), I used the binomial theorem correctly, and found that the term with \\(c^0\\) occurs when \\(m = 3\\), which gives \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying these together gives 6 * 20 = 120. That seems correct. Alternatively, maybe I can think about it another way to verify. Let's consider that \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, when I expand everything, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But since we're only interested in the term that has \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, we can consider that the coefficient will be the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and the sum of the coefficients in the second part, but actually, no, that's not quite right. Because the second part is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which has multiple terms, each with different powers of \\(c\\). But since we're only looking for the term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), which is the constant term, that's why we needed to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion. So, I think my approach was correct. Therefore, the coefficient is 120. Let me just write it out again to make sure: Coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. Coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 20. Multiply them together: 6 * 20 = 120. Yep, that seems right. So, the final answer is 120.\n\nWait a second, but I'm a bit confused now. Because when I multiply two polynomials, the coefficients multiply, but in this case, are we just taking the product of the coefficients of each part? Let me think. So, \\((a + b)^4\\) has terms like \\(a^4\\), \\(4a^3b\\), \\(6a^2b^2\\), etc. And \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) has terms like \\(c^6\\), \\(6c^4\\), \\(15c^2\\), \\(20\\), \\(15/c^2\\), \\(6/c^4\\), \\(1/c^6\\). So, when we multiply these two, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second. So, for the term \\(a^2b^2\\), which has coefficient 6, it gets multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, we need to consider all the terms that result from multiplying \\(a^2b^2\\) by any term in the second expansion. But wait, that would mean that \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by \\(c^6\\), \\(6c^4\\), etc., each time. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not \\(a^2b^2c^6\\) or anything like that. So, perhaps I was wrong before, and actually, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would have terms involving different powers of \\(c\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) alone, without any \\(c\\) terms, would just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part. Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by \\(c^0\\), you get \\(a^2b^2\\), which is the term we're interested in. If you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by \\(c^6\\), you get \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), which is a different term. So, in the entire product, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed the product of the coefficients from each part where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out, i.e., the constant term in the second expansion. So, that confirms my earlier conclusion. Therefore, the coefficient is 120.\n\nWait, but let me make sure that I'm not missing anything else. Suppose I didn't think about it in terms of multiplying the coefficients, but instead tried to compute the entire product. But that would be complicated, as the product would have many terms. Alternatively, perhaps I can think of the problem as finding the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But no, that's not quite right because the sum of coefficients would be when \\(c = 1\\), but that's not what we're doing here. We're specifically looking for the term where \\(c^0\\) is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\).\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can think of the problem as two separate parts: the part involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the part involving \\(c\\). Since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire second part, but that can't be right because the second part has terms with \\(c\\). Wait, no, that's not correct. Because when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second, so the coefficient of a specific term in the first polynomial (like \\(a^2b^2\\)) is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. But in the product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will have coefficients multiplied by all the terms in the second polynomial, but each of those will have different powers of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would actually be the sum of the coefficients of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for all \\(k\\). But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). Wait, no, that's not the case. Wait, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but in the entire expression, which includes terms with \\(c\\). So, actually, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by each term in the second polynomial, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(6a^2b^2c^4\\), etc. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not considering \\(c\\). Wait, that doesn't make sense because \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term in the product, but it's multiplied by \\(c^0\\). So, perhaps the problem is only interested in the term \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). But that would mean that the coefficient is the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is indeed the product of the coefficients from each part. So, that brings me back to my initial conclusion: 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, I think I'm confident that the coefficient is 120.\n\nWait, but let me check again. Let me write out the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) and the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) and see how the multiplication works. So, \\((a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). And \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15/c^2 + 6/c^4 + 1/c^6\\). Now, when I multiply these two, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, \\(6a^2b^2 * c^6 = 6a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(6a^2b^2 * 6c^4 = 36a^2b^2c^4\\), \\(6a^2b^2 * 15c^2 = 90a^2b^2c^2\\), \\(6a^2b^2 * 20 = 120a^2b^2\\), \\(6a^2b^2 * 15/c^2 = 90a^2b^2/c^2\\), and so on. So, in the product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms is only the one where \\(6a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by 20, giving \\(120a^2b^2\\). All the other terms have \\(c\\) raised to some power, so they don't contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) alone. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is indeed 120. That makes sense. So, I think I was correct the first time. The coefficient is 120.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make any calculation errors. So, \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) is 6, correct. \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\) is 20, correct. 6 times 20 is 120, correct. So, yeah, everything checks out.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of the entire expression as a product of two polynomials and use generating functions. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial is 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second is 20, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6*20=120. That seems consistent.\n\nWait, but another way to think about it is to consider that the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, if I expand everything, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, but only the term where \\(c^0\\) will contribute to \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms. So, that's why we need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion and multiply it by the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first. So, that's another way to see it.\n\nWait, but maybe I can use multinomial coefficients or something else. But in this case, since the variables are separate, I think the approach I took is correct. So, I think I can confidently say that the coefficient is 120.\n\nWait, just to be thorough, let me compute the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) to make sure I have the correct coefficient for \\(c^0\\). So, expanding \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem:\n\n- The first term is \\(c^6\\), coefficient 1.\n- The second term is \\(6c^5*(1/c) = 6c^4\\), coefficient 6.\n- The third term is \\(15c^4*(1/c)^2 = 15c^2\\), coefficient 15.\n- The fourth term is \\(20c^3*(1/c)^3 = 20c^0 = 20\\), coefficient 20.\n- The fifth term is \\(15c^2*(1/c)^4 = 15c^{-2}\\), coefficient 15.\n- The sixth term is \\(6c*(1/c)^5 = 6c^{-4}\\), coefficient 6.\n- The seventh term is \\((1/c)^6\\), coefficient 1.\n\nSo, yes, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is indeed 20. That's correct. So, that part is right.\n\nTherefore, putting it all together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 * 20 = 120. So, I think that's the answer.\n\nWait, but let me make sure that I didn't misinterpret the question. The problem says: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in other words, in the entire expansion, collect all terms that have \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of what power of \\(c\\) they have, and sum their coefficients. Wait, is that the case? Or is it asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\)?\n\nWait, actually, the way the problem is phrased is a bit ambiguous. It says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\". So, in the context of polynomials, when you have multiple variables, the coefficient of a specific term is the coefficient when all other variables are set to zero. So, in this case, to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), you would set \\(c = 0\\), but wait, that's not possible because \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) has terms with negative powers of \\(c\\), so setting \\(c = 0\\) would cause division by zero. Hmm, maybe that's not the right approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of the term \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, that would mean that the term is \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by some power of \\(c\\), but the coefficient would be the sum of all coefficients where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present, each multiplied by their respective \\(c\\) terms. Wait, no, that doesn't make sense because each term in the product is a combination of \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\). So, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), meaning that we're looking for all terms in the product that have \\(a^2b^2\\), and we want the sum of their coefficients. But that would be different from what I thought earlier.\n\nWait, but that can't be, because in the expansion, each term would have specific powers of \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\). So, for example, a term could be \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), another \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), and so on. So, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then the coefficient would be the sum of all coefficients from the terms \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for all \\(k\\). But that would require summing over all \\(k\\), which is a bit more involved.\n\nWait, but in that case, the coefficient would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Because each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) would be multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), so the total coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. But the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 * 64 = 384. But that's different from what I thought earlier.\n\nWait, now I'm confused. So, the problem is: what is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, in the product, each term is a combination of powers of \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) can be multiplied by any power of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the sum of all coefficients of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for all \\(k\\). Alternatively, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), meaning that we're considering \\(a^2b^2\\) as a term on its own, then it's the coefficient when \\(c^0\\) is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), which is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but the way the problem is phrased is ambiguous. It says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\". In algebra, when you're asked for the coefficient of a specific term in a multivariable polynomial, it's usually the coefficient when all other variables are considered as coefficients. So, in this case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient when \\(c^0\\) is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), because otherwise, if you include all powers of \\(c\\), you're not really looking for a single coefficient but a combination of coefficients.\n\nWait, for example, if you have a term like \\(a^2b^2c^3\\), that's a different term from \\(a^2b^2c^2\\), and each has its own coefficient. So, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), it's likely referring to the coefficient when \\(c^0\\) is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), which is 120. If it were asking for the sum of all coefficients where \\(a^2b^2\\) appears, regardless of \\(c\\), that would be 6 * 64 = 384, as I thought earlier. But since the problem just says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", without specifying anything about \\(c\\), I think it's more likely that it's asking for the coefficient when \\(c^0\\) is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), which is 120. Because otherwise, if you consider all powers of \\(c\\), it's not a single coefficient but a sum over multiple coefficients.\n\nWait, but to clarify, let's think about how the product is structured. The product is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second part, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), etc. So, in the entire product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) by itself (without any \\(c\\)) only occurs once, which is when it's multiplied by the constant term in the second expansion, which is 20. So, that term is \\(6a^2b^2 \\times 20 = 120a^2b^2\\). All other terms involving \\(a^2b^2\\) have some power of \\(c\\) attached. So, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), meaning the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present without any \\(c\\) terms, then the coefficient is 120. If it were asking for the sum of coefficients of all terms involving \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\), that would be different, but I think it's the former.\n\nWait, to confirm, let me look up how coefficients are typically interpreted in multivariable polynomials. From what I recall, the coefficient of a specific monomial in a multivariable polynomial is the coefficient when that exact monomial is present. So, for example, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient of the term \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), because that's the only term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present without any \\(c\\) terms. So, in this case, that would be 120. If the problem wanted the sum of coefficients of all terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) appears with any power of \\(c\\), it would have specified that, perhaps by saying \"the sum of coefficients of terms involving \\(a^2b^2\\)\". So, I think it's safe to go with 120 as the answer.\n\nWait, but just to be thorough, let me compute the sum of all coefficients where \\(a^2b^2\\) appears. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^6\\) would be 6 * 1 = 6, \\(a^2b^2c^4\\) would be 6 * 6 = 36, \\(a^2b^2c^2\\) would be 6 * 15 = 90, \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 * 20 = 120, \\(a^2b^2/c^2\\) is 6 * 15 = 90, \\(a^2b^2/c^4\\) is 6 * 6 = 36, and \\(a^2b^2/c^6\\) is 6 * 1 = 6. So, if we add all these up: 6 + 36 + 90 + 120 + 90 + 36 + 6 = let's see: 6 + 36 = 42, 42 + 90 = 132, 132 + 120 = 252, 252 + 90 = 342, 342 + 36 = 378, 378 + 6 = 384. So, the sum of all coefficients of terms involving \\(a^2b^2\\) is 384. But the problem didn't ask for that; it just asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which I think refers to the term \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), so 120. Therefore, I think my initial answer is correct.\n\nWait, but let me check with a different approach. Suppose I set \\(c = 1\\). Then \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = (1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, the entire expression becomes \\((a + b)^4 * 64\\). Then, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in this would be 6 * 64 = 384. But that's the sum of all coefficients where \\(a^2b^2\\) appears with any power of \\(c\\), as we saw earlier. But if I set \\(c = 1\\), I'm effectively summing over all coefficients for each term, which is why it gives 384. However, if I set \\(c = 0\\), but that's problematic because of the \\(1/c\\) term. Alternatively, perhaps I can set \\(c = 1\\) to find the sum of coefficients, but that's not directly helpful for finding the specific coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\).\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use generating functions or generating series to extract the specific coefficient. But I think that might be overcomplicating it. From my earlier reasoning, I think the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 120, as that's the coefficient when multiplied by \\(c^0\\). So, I think I'll stick with that.\n\nWait, but to make sure, let me think about the definition of the coefficient of a term in a product of polynomials. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the sum over all \\(k\\) of (coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) in the product). But if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), it's ambiguous whether it wants the coefficient when \\(c^0\\) is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\) or the sum of all coefficients where \\(a^2b^2\\) appears with any power of \\(c\\). However, in standard algebraic terminology, the coefficient of a specific monomial is the coefficient when that exact monomial is present. So, in this case, \\(a^2b^2\\) is a monomial, and its coefficient would be the coefficient when \\(c^0\\) is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), which is 120.\n\nTherefore, after all this thinking, I believe the coefficient is 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break down the problem into two parts using the binomial theorem.\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term with \\(a^2b^2\\) occurs when \\(k = 2\\):\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\n   \\]\n   Thus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\n2. **Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n   \\]\n   We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0:\n   \\[\n   6 - 2m = 0 \\implies m = 3\n   \\]\n   The coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\n   \\]\n\n3. **Multiply the coefficients from each part:**\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20.

Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the two coefficients I found: 6 (from \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part) multiplied by 20 (from \\(c^0\\) in the second part). So, 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120. Wait, let me just double-check that. So, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). In \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0 occurs when \\(m = 3\\), which gives \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, when we multiply these two expansions together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by the constant term 20, resulting in 6 * 20 = 120. I think that's correct. Alternatively, another way to think about it is that since the two parts are multiplied together, and we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), we can treat the entire \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) as a scalar multiple when considering the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient is 6 multiplied by the value of the entire second expression evaluated at \\(c^0\\), which is 20, giving 120. Yeah, that makes sense. I don't think I made any mistakes here.

That makes sense because when you multiply the two expressions, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would come from taking \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part and the \\(c^0\\) term from the second part. So, first, let me find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\).

So, the overall coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) would be 6 multiplied by 20, which is 120. Wait, let me double-check that.

But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, I think I need to consider all possible terms where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2, which would involve multiplying \\(a^2b^2\\) by any term from the second expression, but the \\(c\\) part doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) exponents.

The \\(c\\) terms don't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\), I think it's just the product of the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) and the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that doesn't seem right because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), not involving \\(c\\). Wait, no, actually, when you multiply two expressions, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, if I have \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part, it will be multiplied by each term in the second part, which is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).

Wait, no, actually, I think I'm misunderstanding. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, which would mean that we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by any power of \\(c\\). But that doesn't make sense because in the product, each term would have both \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) exponents and some \\(c\\) exponent. So, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), i.e., the constant term in \\(c\\). Because otherwise, if it's just \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), then the coefficient would be the same as in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which would be an infinite series, but that doesn't make sense. So, I think the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where \\(a\\) is squared, \\(b\\) is squared, and \\(c\\) is to the zero power. So, I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, to do that, I can first find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which I already found as 6, and then multiply it by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, now I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me expand that using the binomial theorem as well. So, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, each term has an exponent of \\(6 - 2k\\). We need the exponent to be 0, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Let me compute that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Now, going back to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product is the product of the coefficients from each part. So, that would be 6 (from \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\)) multiplied by 20 (from \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)). Therefore, 6 * 20 = 120. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120. Wait, but let me double-check that. So, in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term is of the form \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}a^{4 - k}b^k \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, to get \\(a^2b^2\\), we need \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\), as I found before. Then, for the \\(c\\) part, we need \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the term is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\dbinom{6}{3}a^2b^2c^0 = 6 * 20 a^2b^2 = 120a^2b^2\\). So, yes, the coefficient is 120. I think that's the correct answer.

So, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6. In \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. When you multiply these two, 6 * 20 = 120.

    "text": " Because if I take \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part and multiply it by, say, \\(c^k\\) from the second part, that would give me a term with \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), which isn't just \\(a^2b^2\\). So, to get a term that's exactly \\(a^2b^2\\), I need to multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by the constant term in the second expression. So, that means I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Once I have that constant term, I can multiply it by the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, and that should give me the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression. So, let me work on finding the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Again, I can use the binomial theorem here. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying each term, that's \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m} = \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, each term has an exponent of \\(c\\) equal to \\(6 - 2m\\). I'm looking for the term where the exponent is 0 because that's the constant term. So, I set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\) and solve for \\(m\\). Subtracting 6 from both sides gives \\(-2m = -6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is when \\(m = 3\\), so the term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} c^{0}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficients from each part, which is \\(6 \\times 20\\). Let me compute that: 6 times 20 is 120. So, the coefficient should be 120. Wait, let me just make sure I didn't make a mistake here. So, in the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6. In the second part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the constant term is 20. Multiplying them gives 6 times 20, which is 120. Hmm, that seems right. Alternatively, maybe I can think of the entire expression as a product of two expansions, but since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) won't interact with the terms involving \\(c\\). So, when you multiply out \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will only come from multiplying the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first expansion by the constant term in the second expansion. So, yes, that makes sense. Therefore, I think my answer is correct. The coefficient is 120. So, I can write that as the final answer.\n\nWait, let me just go through it again to make sure I didn't skip any steps or make any miscalculations. So, starting with \\((a + b)^4\\), the expansion is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^4 \\dbinom{4}{k}a^{4 - k}b^k\\). For \\(a^2b^2\\), \\(4 - k = 2\\) implies \\(k = 2\\), so the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Then, in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the expansion is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^6 \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - m}(1/c)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^6 \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\). The constant term occurs when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), so \\(m = 3\\), giving \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying these together, 6 * 20 = 120. Yes, that seems correct. So, the coefficient is 120.\n\nI think that's it. I can't see any mistakes in this reasoning.

Wait, no, that can't be right because the entire expression is a product of two polynomials, so the \\(c\\) terms will affect the overall terms. But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\). So, that must mean that we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), because any other power of \\(c\\) would make the term different. So, to clarify, the term we're interested in is \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by \\(c^0\\), so we need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product. Therefore, the coefficient will be the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).

So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120. Wait, let me make sure I didn't miss anything. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\) with coefficient 6, and the term \\(c^0\\) comes from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) with coefficient 20. Multiplying them together gives 6 * 20 = 120. So, yes, that seems correct.

Since the problem is only asking for \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, but in reality, in the product, each term is a combination of \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\), so the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) is to multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term by the \\(c^0\\) term.

But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which implies that it's the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2, regardless of the exponents of \\(c\\). Wait, no, that's not correct. Because in the product, each term is a combination of exponents from both polynomials. So, actually, to get the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I need to consider all possible terms in the expansion where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any term from the second polynomial, but since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I think we need to find the sum of all coefficients where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any power of \\(c\\). Wait, but that would mean the coefficient would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which would make the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) equal to 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems like it's not a constant; it's a polynomial in \\(c\\). However, the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would include all the terms from the second polynomial multiplied by 6. But wait, that can't be right because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, not an expression. So maybe I misunderstood. Let me think again. Maybe the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, which would mean considering the product of the two polynomials. So, in other words, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would come from multiplying \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part by any term from the second part, but since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, we need to sum all the coefficients from the second polynomial and multiply by 6. Wait, but that would mean the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems off because the sum of coefficients in a polynomial is found by setting all variables to 1. So, if I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) becomes \\((1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 * 64 = 384. But wait, let me check that again. Alternatively, maybe I need to think differently. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the product of the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial and each term in the second polynomial. So, each term in the second polynomial is a multiple of some power of \\(c\\), but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) exponent, we would sum over all possible terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any term from the second polynomial. Therefore, the coefficient would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial. That is, 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Let me try another approach. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When we expand this, each term will be of the form \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}a^{4 - k}b^k \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - m} \\times \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\dbinom{4}{k}\\dbinom{6}{m}a^{4 - k}b^k c^{6 - 2m}\\). Now, we are looking for the term where \\(a^2b^2\\), so that means \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). So, \\(k = 2\\), and the coefficient from the first part is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Now, for each such term, we have a coefficient from the second part, which is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\), and the exponent of \\(c\\) is \\(6 - 2m\\). However, since we are only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the exponent of \\(c\\), we need to sum over all possible \\(m\\) values. That is, the total coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) would be \\(6 \\times \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m}\\). Wait, but \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m}\\) is equal to \\(2^6 = 64\\). So, the total coefficient would be \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 384. Let me just verify this again. So, in the first part, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. The second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), when expanded, has terms with various exponents of \\(c\\), but when we multiply the first polynomial by the second, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) will include all possible products of \\(a^2b^2\\) with each term from the second polynomial. Since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) exponent, the coefficient would be the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients from the second part. The sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, 6 * 64 = 384. That seems correct. Alternatively, if the problem had asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some specific \\(k\\), then we would have to consider only the terms where the exponent of \\(c\\) is \\(k\\). But since it's just \\(a^2b^2\\), we need to sum over all possible \\(c\\) exponents, which means multiplying by the total sum of coefficients in the second polynomial.

So, essentially, I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) and then multiply it by the coefficient 6 from the first part. That makes sense. So, now I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Again, I can use the binomial theorem for this. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\).

Wait, no, that's not quite right. Let me think again. When you multiply two expressions, each term in the first expression is multiplied by each term in the second expression. So, if I have \\( (a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 \\), each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), we need to find all the ways that multiplying a term from \\((a + b)^4\\) with a term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) results in a term that only has \\(a^2b^2\\). That means that the term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) must be a constant term, i.e., a term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. Because if the term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) has any power of \\(c\\), then the resulting term would have that power of \\(c\\) as well, but since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the only way is if the \\(c\\) part is multiplied by 1, which is the constant term. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Therefore, I need to compute two things: 1. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which I already found as 6. 2. The coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Then, multiply these two coefficients together to get the final coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression. So, let me focus on the second part: finding the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Again, I can use the binomial theorem for this. The binomial theorem states that \\((x + y)^n = \\sum_{k=0}^{n} \\dbinom{n}{k} x^{n - k} y^k\\). In this case, \\(x = c\\) and \\(y = \\dfrac{1}{c}\\), and \\(n = 6\\). So, expanding \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) gives \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k\\). Simplifying each term, we get \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\times c^{-k}\\) which is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, so we set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\) so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Now, going back to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the two coefficients I found: 6 (from \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\)) multiplied by 20 (from \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)). So, 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120. Let me double-check to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.

So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120. Wait, let me double-check to make sure I didn't make a mistake. So, \\((a + b)^4\\) gives a coefficient of 6 for \\(a^2b^2\\), and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) gives a coefficient of 20 for \\(c^0\\). Multiplying these together, 6 * 20 is indeed 120. Hmm, that seems right. I don't think I missed anything here. So, the final answer should be 120. \n\nWait, hold on, let me think again. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product. Since the product is \\((a + b)^4\\) times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by every term in the second expansion. But since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the second expansion is in terms of \\(c\\), when we multiply, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second part. However, the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which means we are only interested in the terms where the product results in \\(a^2b^2\\) times some power of \\(c\\). But wait, actually, no. Because \\(a^2b^2\\) is already in terms of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the second part is in terms of \\(c\\), the entire product will have terms that are products of \\(a^kb^{4 - k}\\) and \\(c^m\\) or \\(c^{-m}\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is only affected by the terms in the second expansion that are constants (i.e., \\(c^0\\)), because if you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by \\(c^m\\) or \\(c^{-m}\\), you'll get \\(a^2b^2c^m\\) or \\(a^2b^2c^{-m}\\), which are different terms. Therefore, the only way to get a term that is just \\(a^2b^2\\) (without any \\(c\\) terms) is to multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by the constant term in the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient is indeed 6 * 20 = 120. So, I think I was correct the first time. \n\nBut let me think again: when you have the product of two polynomials, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, to get a term with only \\(a^2b^2\\), you need to pick the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first polynomial and the constant term from the second. Any other term from the second polynomial would introduce a \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\) factor, which would change the term into something else, not just \\(a^2b^2\\). So, yes, only the constant term from the second polynomial will contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. Therefore, the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in calculating the binomial coefficients. For \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\), which is correct. For \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term where the exponent is 0 is when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Then, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\), which is also correct. So, 6 * 20 is indeed 120. \n\nIs there another way to approach this problem? Maybe by considering the entire expansion? Let me see. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). If I were to expand this, each term would be of the form \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}a^{4 - k}b^k \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the general term is \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}\\dbinom{6}{m}a^{4 - k}b^k c^{6 - 2m}\\). We are looking for the term where \\(a^{2}b^{2}\\), so that means \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). So, \\(k = 2\\), and then for the exponent of \\(c\\), we need \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\dbinom{6}{3} = 6 \\times 20 = 120\\), which is the same result as before. So, this confirms that the coefficient is indeed 120. \n\nWait, but just to be thorough, let me consider if there's any other combination of \\(k\\) and \\(m\\) that could result in \\(a^2b^2\\). For example, if \\(k\\) were different, say \\(k = 1\\), then \\(4 - k = 3\\), which would give \\(a^3b\\), which is not what we want. Similarly, \\(k = 3\\) would give \\(a b^3\\), which is also not \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the only \\(k\\) that gives \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(k = 2\\). Similarly, for the exponent of \\(c\\), we need it to be 0, so only \\(m = 3\\) works. Therefore, there's only one term contributing to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is when \\(k = 2\\) and \\(m = 3\\), giving the coefficient as 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nI think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning.

So, the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) is by multiplying the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first polynomial with the constant term from the second.

So, I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and then multiply it by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part. That makes sense because when you multiply them together, you get the term \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), which is just \\(a^2b^2\\). So, first, I already found that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. Now, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me think about how to expand that. Again, using the binomial theorem, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying that, each term becomes \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m} = \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, we have terms with exponents \\(6 - 2m\\). We need the term where the exponent is 0, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). So, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Let me calculate that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Now, to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, I need to multiply the coefficients from each part. So, that's 6 (from \\(a^2b^2\\)) times 20 (from \\(c^0\\)), which is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 120. Wait, let me double-check that. So, the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) gives \\(a^2b^2\\) with coefficient 6, and the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) gives \\(c^0\\) with coefficient 20. So, when you multiply these two polynomials together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term of the second polynomial. But since we only want the term where the power of \\(c\\) is zero, we only take the term with \\(c^0\\), which is 20. So, the combined coefficient is indeed 6 * 20 = 120. I think that's correct. So, the final answer is 120.\n\nWait, but hold on. Let me make sure I didn't miss anything. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so I considered the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) and found the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is 6. Then, since the other part is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in that, which is 20, as I calculated. Then, since when you multiply the two expressions, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first is multiplied by the \\(c^0\\) term in the second, resulting in \\(a^2b^2 \\times 1\\) (since \\(c^0 = 1\\)), so the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120. That seems correct. Alternatively, if I were to expand both polynomials completely, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term would come from all possible products where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2 each, but since the other polynomial doesn't affect \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), it's just the product of the coefficients. So, yeah, I think 120 is the correct coefficient.

So, the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is to take the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part and multiply it by the constant term (the term with \\(c^0\\)) from the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Therefore, I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) and then multiply it by 6 to get the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression.

I don't think there are any other terms that would contribute to \\(a^2b^2\\) because any other term from the second polynomial would have a power of \\(c\\), which would change the term to something else, not just \\(a^2b^2\\). So, I think that's the correct answer.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. Maybe I should consider if there's any other way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) when multiplying by the second polynomial.

Then, that product will be the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression. So, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).

Simplifying that, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m} = \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, we need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be 0, which means \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), \\(6 = 2m\\) implies \\(m = 3\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Therefore, going back to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of 6 and 20. So, 6 times 20 is 120. Therefore, the coefficient is 120. Wait, let me double-check that. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. When we multiply these two parts together, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by all terms from the second part, but we're only interested in the constant term (with respect to \\(c\\)) because \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\). So, only the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0 will contribute to \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms. So, that term is 20, so 6 * 20 = 120. Yeah, that seems right. Let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in calculating the binomial coefficients. For \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\), that's 6, correct. For \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\), that's 20, correct. So, 6 * 20 = 120. So, the coefficient is 120. I think that's the answer. Wait, just to make sure, maybe I should consider if there's another way to approach this. Alternatively, maybe I can consider the entire expansion, but that would be too time-consuming. Alternatively, perhaps I can think of the product as two separate parts, one involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the other involving \\(c\\). Since the terms are independent, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the product of the coefficients from each part. So, the coefficient from the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) part is 6, and from the \\(c\\) part, it's 20, so 6 * 20 is 120. Yeah, that seems consistent.

Wait, no, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think again. The problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, that means in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times any power of \\(c\\).

But wait, no, that's not right either. Wait, in the product, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by every term in the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire second expansion. But that can't be right because then the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\), not a constant. Wait, but the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would mean the coefficient is a number, not involving \\(c\\). So, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Wait, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some \\(k\\), but it's not specified. Wait, no, the problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", which would imply that we're considering terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any power of \\(c\\). But that would make the coefficient a polynomial in \\(c\\). However, the way the problem is phrased, I think it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, that would mean that the coefficient is the sum over all possible \\(c\\) terms multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). But that seems a bit odd. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, so that \\(a^2b^2\\) would have a coefficient that is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But that seems more complicated. Wait, perhaps I need to clarify: the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the product is a polynomial in \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\). The term \\(a^2b^2\\) can be multiplied by any power of \\(c\\), so the coefficient would be a sum of terms involving \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would be the entire expression that multiplies \\(a^2b^2\\). But that seems too broad. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the constant term with respect to \\(c\\). That would make more sense. So, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\). So, in other words, the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\). That would make sense because otherwise, the coefficient would involve \\(c\\) terms. So, perhaps I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product. So, how do I approach that? Let me think. So, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, as I found earlier. Now, in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\). Because when I multiply these two, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part will multiply the \\(c^0\\) term from the second part, giving me \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is the term we're interested in. So, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me do that. Using the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, we need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0. That is, \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). So, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion is 20. Now, since we're multiplying the two expansions together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product is the product of the coefficients from each part. So, that would be 6 (from \\(a^2b^2\\)) multiplied by 20 (from \\(c^0\\)), giving 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120. Wait, but let me double-check that. So, the first part gives 6 for \\(a^2b^2\\), and the second part gives 20 for \\(c^0\\). So, when you multiply these, you get 6 * 20 = 120. That seems correct. Alternatively, if the problem had asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some specific \\(k\\), we would have to consider that, but since it's just \\(a^2b^2\\), I think it's safe to assume that they want the coefficient where \\(c^0\\) is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the final answer should be 120. Let me just recap to make sure I didn't miss anything. First, expand \\((a + b)^4\\) and find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is 6. Then, expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) and find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\), which is 20. Multiply them together to get 120. That seems correct. I don't think I made any mistakes in the calculations. So, the coefficient is 120.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break down the problem into two parts:\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\), so the coefficient is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\n   \\]\n\n2. **Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n   \\]\n   We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0:\n   \\[\n   6 - 2k = 0 \\implies k = 3\n   \\]\n   The coefficient is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\n   \\]\n\n3. **Multiply the coefficients from both expansions:**\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 20 = 120\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

We need the term where the exponent is 0 because we're looking for \\(c^0\\). So, set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\) so \\(m = 3\\). So, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Now, going back to the original expression, when we multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will multiply the \\(c^0\\) term from the second part, which has a coefficient of 20. So, the overall coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be the product of the two coefficients: 6 * 20 = 120. Wait, let me make sure I'm not missing anything here. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6, and the term \\(c^0\\) in the second part is 20, so when multiplied, the coefficient is 6*20=120, and the term becomes \\(120a^2b^2c^0 = 120a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient is 120. Let me just check if I considered all possibilities. Since we're looking for \\(a^2b^2\\), and the second part is in terms of \\(c\\), which doesn't interact with \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) is from the product of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and \\(c^0\\) in the second part. So, I think that's correct. So, the coefficient is 120. \n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes in my calculations. Let me go through each step again. First, expanding \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Then, expanding \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\). Setting \\(6 - 2m = 0\\) gives \\(m = 3\\), so the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying these together gives 6*20 = 120. So, yes, I think that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of it another way. Since the two parts are multiplied together, the entire expression is the product of two polynomials. So, when we look for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), it's the sum over all possible products of coefficients from each part that result in \\(a^2b^2\\). But since the second part doesn't have \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) is by taking the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part and multiplying it by any term from the second part, but since we want \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms, we have to take the term from the second part that has \\(c^0\\). Therefore, the coefficient is just the product of the two coefficients, which is 6*20=120. So, that's consistent with my earlier conclusion.\n\nWait, but let me think again. If the second part had terms with \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), then I would have to consider cross terms, but in this case, it's only in terms of \\(c\\), so it doesn't affect \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is indeed just the product of the coefficients from each part. So, 6 from the first part and 20 from the second part, giving 120.\n\nSo, I think I've got it. The coefficient is 120. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning, so I think that's the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by determining the relevant coefficients in each part and multiplying them.\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\), so the coefficient is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\n   \\]\n\n2. **Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n   \\]\n   The term with \\(c^0\\) occurs when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), so \\(m = 3\\).

    "text": " Because if I take any term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), say \\(c^k\\) or \\(c^{-k}\\), multiplying it by \\(a^2b^2\\) would give a term with \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2c^{-k}\\), but since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), that would require the exponent of \\(c\\) to be zero. So, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Then, multiply that by the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, to get the overall coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression. So, let's focus on expanding \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Again, using the binomial theorem: \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying the exponents: \\(c^{6 - m} \\times c^{-m} = c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, so set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\): \\(6 = 2m\\) implies \\(m = 3\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Now, going back to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Since these two coefficients multiply when we take the product of the two expressions, the overall coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Wait, let me make sure I didn't miss anything. So, when I expand \\((a + b)^4\\), I get terms like \\(a^4\\), \\(4a^3b\\), \\(6a^2b^2\\), \\(4ab^3\\), and \\(b^4\\). Similarly, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) expands to terms with various powers of \\(c\\), and the constant term is 20. So, when I multiply these two expansions together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will come from multiplying \\(6a^2b^2\\) by the constant term 20, giving \\(120a^2b^2\\). Are there any other terms that could contribute to \\(a^2b^2\\)? Let me think. If I take a term from the first expansion, say \\(a^3b\\), and multiply it by a term from the second expansion, say \\(c^{-1}\\), would that somehow give me \\(a^2b^2\\)? Wait, no, because the \\(c\\) terms don't affect the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). So, any term from the second expansion would only affect the exponent of \\(c\\), not \\(a\\) or \\(b\\). So, the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) is by taking the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first expansion and multiplying it by the constant term from the second expansion. Therefore, I don't need to consider any other terms. So, I think my earlier conclusion is correct. The coefficient is 120. Just to double-check, let me compute the expansions step by step. First, \\((a + b)^4\\): The expansion is \\(a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6. Next, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\): The expansion will have terms from \\(c^6\\) down to \\(c^{-6}\\), with coefficients given by the binomial coefficients. The middle term, when \\(m = 3\\), is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}c^{0} = 20\\). So, that term is 20. Therefore, when I multiply the two expansions, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first polynomial will only combine with the constant term 20 from the second polynomial to give \\(6 \\times 20 = 120a^2b^2\\). There are no other terms in the second polynomial that would affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) exponents, so no other contributions to \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, I can confidently say that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120. I don't think I made any mistakes here. The key was recognizing that to get \\(a^2b^2\\), I only needed the specific term from each polynomial and that the \\(c\\) terms don't interfere with the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) exponents. So, yeah, 120 should be the correct coefficient.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break down the problem as follows:\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term with \\(a^2b^2\\) occurs when \\(k = 2\\):\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\n   \\]\n   So, the coefficient is 6.\n\n2. **Find the constant term (coefficient of \\(c^0\\)) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n   \\]\n   The exponent \\(6 - 2m = 0\\) when \\(m = 3\\):\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{6}{3} c^0 = 20\n   \\]\n   So, the coefficient is 20.\n\n3. **Multiply the coefficients from both expansions:**\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 20 = 120\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

That makes sense because when you multiply the two expansions, the only way to get a term with \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms is to multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by a term that's just a constant (i.e., \\(c^0\\)). So, let me first calculate the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Again, I can use the binomial theorem here. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\).
