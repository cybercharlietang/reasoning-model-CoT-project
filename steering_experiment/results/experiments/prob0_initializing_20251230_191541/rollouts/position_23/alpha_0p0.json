Wait, but no, because when you multiply the two expressions, each term from the first is multiplied by each term from the second, so \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would actually be the sum of all the coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by 6. Wait, that doesn't sound right. Let me think again. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be \\(a^2b^2 \\times \\text{(some term from the second expansion)}\\). So, if the second expansion is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which expands to terms like \\(c^6\\), \\(6c^4\\), \\(15c^2\\), \\(20c^0\\), \\(15c^{-2}\\), \\(6c^{-4}\\), \\(c^{-6}\\), etc., then when we multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), each of these terms would give a term like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(6a^2b^2c^4\\), \\(15a^2b^2c^2\\), \\(20a^2b^2\\), etc. So, in the entire product, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient from the first part (which is 6) multiplied by the entire second expansion. But that would mean that the coefficient is \\(6 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that includes \\(c^0\\), because otherwise, the coefficient would be a function of \\(c\\), not a single number. So, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\). That would make more sense because then the coefficient would be a numerical value. So, in that case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) (with \\(c^0\\)) would be 6 multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). That seems plausible. So, first, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me compute that. Using the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, we're looking for the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, which means \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire product is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the second part), which is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120.\n\nWait, let me double-check that. So, in the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). In the second part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term with \\(c^0\\) is when \\(k = 3\\), so the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, when we multiply these two parts together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part, but the only term that contributes to \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms is when we multiply by the constant term in the second part. So, that would be 6 times 20, which is 120. Yes, that seems correct. I don't think I made any mistakes here. So, the coefficient is 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem.\n\nFirst, consider the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\). Using the binomial theorem, we have:\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n\\]\nThe term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\), so the coefficient is:\n\\[\n\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\n\\]\n\nNext, consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).

Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(k = 3\\).

Then, in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term where \\(c\\) cancels out is when the exponents of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) are equal, which is when \\(m = 3\\), giving us \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, multiplying 6 and 20 gives 120. That seems right. I don't think I made a mistake there.\n\nWait another thought: when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\(a^2b^2\\) times the constant term in the second polynomial. So, the coefficient is indeed 6 times 20, which is 120.

    "text": " Because any other term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) would have a power of \\(c\\) which isn't present in \\(a^2b^2\\). So, I think I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) and then multiply it by the coefficient 6 from the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. That makes sense because when you multiply the two expansions, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, but only the term with \\(c^0\\) will result in a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), which is what we want. So, let me now find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Again, I can use the binomial theorem here. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\).

We want the term where the exponent is 0, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Now, going back to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficients from each part. So, that's 6 (from \\(a^2b^2\\)) multiplied by 20 (from \\(c^0\\)). So, 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120. Wait, let me double-check that. So, the first part gives 6, and the second part gives 20, and since we're looking for the term where the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) exponents are 2, and the \\(c\\) exponent is 0, the product would indeed be 6 * 20 = 120.

Therefore, to get the term \\(a^2b^2\\), I need to multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part by the constant term from the second part. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part. So, first, I have the coefficient from the first part as 6, as I found earlier. Now, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me apply the binomial theorem again here. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\).

So, the term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} c^{0}\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part is 20. Now, putting it all together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the two coefficients: 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the second part). So, 6 * 20 = 120. Wait, is that correct? Let me double-check. So, the first part gives 6 for \\(a^2b^2\\), the second part gives 20 for \\(c^0\\), so when you multiply these together, you get 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120. Hmm, that seems a bit high, but I think it's correct because both coefficients are being multiplied. Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in assuming that the \\(c\\) terms don't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. Let me think again: when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part will be multiplied by every term in the second part, which includes terms with various powers of \\(c\\). However, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. Wait, no, actually, I think I misread the problem. Wait, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but in the entire expression, which includes \\(c\\) terms. Wait, no, that can't be. Because \\(a^2b^2\\) would be part of the product, but the product also includes \\(c\\) terms. Wait, but actually, when you multiply two expressions, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second, so the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part would be multiplied by each term in the second part, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\). So, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product. Wait, but \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term that would be present only once, multiplied by the constant term from the second part, as I thought earlier. So, the coefficient would be 6 * 20 = 120. Alternatively, maybe the problem is considering the entire expression and looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which would mean that the \\(c\\) terms are variables as well, and \\(a^2b^2\\) is just a part of the product. But in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of the second part, but that doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a specific term. Wait, perhaps I need to clarify: when the problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", does it mean the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by any combination of \\(c\\) terms? Or does it mean the coefficient of the term \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms? I think it's the latter, because otherwise, the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make much sense as a single coefficient. So, I think the problem is asking for the coefficient of the term \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is just \\(a^2b^2\\), so the coefficient would be 6 * 20 = 120. Alternatively, maybe I should consider that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, but that would mean that the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't seem right. Therefore, I think my initial approach is correct: find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part, which is 20, and multiply them together to get 120. Therefore, the coefficient is 120. Let me just check my calculations again. \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) is indeed 6. For the second part, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\) is 20. So, 6 * 20 = 120.

Let me double-check. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\) as 6, and the constant term from the other expansion is 20, so when you multiply these, the coefficient becomes 6 * 20 = 120. Yeah, that seems right.

Therefore, the final answer should be 120.\n\nWait, hold on, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in calculating the binomial coefficients. So, \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) is 6, that's correct because 4 choose 2 is 6. And \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\) is 20, which is also correct because 6 choose 3 is 20. So, 6 * 20 is 120. Yeah, that seems correct.

So, for the term \\(a^2b^2\\), we need \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\), which gives us \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). And for the \\(c\\) part, we need \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which gives \\(m = 3\\), so \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120. Yep, that's consistent with what I found earlier.

So, since the first part's coefficient is 6 and the second part's constant term is 20, multiplying them gives 120.

Is there a possibility that other terms in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) could contribute to the \\(a^2b^2\\) term when multiplied by other terms from \\((a + b)^4\\)?

But wait, in \\((a + b)^4\\), all the terms are only in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), so when I multiply by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the only way to get a term that is purely \\(a^2b^2\\) (i.e., without any \\(c\\) terms) is to multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from \\((a + b)^4\\) by the \\(c^0\\) term from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\).

    "text": " Because if you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by any term involving \\(c\\), you'll get a term like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), which isn't just \\(a^2b^2\\).

Again, using the binomial theorem: \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m} = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\).

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't miss anything. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first part, and the \\(c^0\\) term comes from the second part. When you multiply these two, you get \\(a^2b^2 * c^0\\), which is just \\(a^2b^2\\), and the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120. So, I think that's the answer. Let me just double-check my steps.

    "text": " Because any other term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) would introduce a \\(c\\) term, and since we're only looking for a term without \\(c\\), we need the constant term. So, first, let me confirm that. So, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be the product of the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first part and the constant term in the second part. Therefore, the coefficient will be the product of the coefficients from each part. So, I already found that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. Now, I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me use the binomial theorem again for this. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying that, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m} = \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). Now, the constant term occurs when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. So, set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which gives \\(2m = 6\\) and thus \\(m = 3\\). So, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Let me calculate that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of 6 and 20, which is 120. Wait, let me check if I did that correctly. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\) with coefficient 6, and the constant term from the other expansion is 20. So, 6 * 20 = 120. That seems right. But wait, let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes in calculating the binomial coefficients. For \\((a + b)^4\\), \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) is indeed 6 because 4 choose 2 is 6. And for \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term where \\(m = 3\\) gives \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\), which is correct. So, 6 * 20 is 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120. Hmm, that seems straightforward, but let me just think again to make sure I didn't overlook anything. So, the original expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). We're looking for the term \\(a^2b^2\\), which only comes from the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first part and the constant term in the second part because any other term in the second part would introduce \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), which would make the term not just \\(a^2b^2\\) but something like \\(a^2b^2c\\) or \\(a^2b^2/c\\). Since the problem is asking for \\(a^2b^2\\), we can ignore those terms because they would have additional factors of \\(c\\). So, the only term contributing to \\(a^2b^2\\) is the product of the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first polynomial and the constant term from the second polynomial. Therefore, the coefficient is indeed 6 * 20 = 120. I think that's correct. I don't see any mistakes in the reasoning.

Wait, but let me double-check that. Because when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second, but in this case, since we're looking for a specific term \\(a^2b^2\\), and the second polynomial's constant term is 20, so the product would be \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\), so the coefficient is 120. Hmm, that seems right. Alternatively, maybe I should consider that the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), so when you expand it, each term from \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), so the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part can be multiplied by any term from the second part, but since the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), but the other part can have any power of \\(c\\). Wait, but that's not the case. Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by, say, \\(c^k\\), you get a term \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), which is a different term. But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so perhaps it's considering all possible terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present, regardless of the power of \\(c\\). Wait, but that's not correct because \\(a^2b^2\\) would only be multiplied by the constant term in the second polynomial to get a term that's just \\(a^2b^2\\), without any \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\). So, if I multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by, say, \\(c\\), I get \\(a^2b^2c\\), which is a different term, not just \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is just the product of the coefficients from each part where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2, and the exponents of \\(c\\) are 0. So, that would be 6 (from \\((a + b)^4\\)) times 20 (from the constant term in the second polynomial), giving 120. So, I think that's the correct coefficient.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not missing anything. Let me consider the entire expansion. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the first part, and when multiplied by the constant term from the second part, it gives \\(a^2b^2 \\times 1\\), which is just \\(a^2b^2\\). But if I take \\(a^2b^2\\) and multiply it by any other term from the second polynomial, like \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), then the term would have \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), so it's a different term, not just \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, only the constant term in the second polynomial contributes to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. So, yes, 6 times 20 is 120. Therefore, the coefficient is 120.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me think again. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). When I expand this, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, which includes terms with \\(c^6\\), \\(c^4\\), \\(c^2\\), \\(1\\), \\(c^{-2}\\), \\(c^{-4}\\), and \\(c^{-6}\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by each of these, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), and so on. But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would only come from the term where the power of \\(c\\) is zero. So, that's the constant term, which is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times 20, which is 120. So, I think that's correct.\n\nWait, but another way to think about it is that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). But no, that's not the case. Because in the product, each term is a combination of \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\). So, if you're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), it's the sum of all coefficients where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present, regardless of the power of \\(c\\). Wait, but that's not the case. Because \\(a^2b^2\\) can be multiplied by any power of \\(c\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would actually be the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the entire second polynomial. Wait, no, that can't be right because the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is a specific term, and if you multiply by the entire second polynomial, you'd have \\(a^2b^2\\) times the entire expansion of the second part, which would create multiple terms with \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by different powers of \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so perhaps it's considering all terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. Wait, but that's not how it works. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would only be the coefficient when the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2, regardless of the exponents of \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would be the product of the coefficients from each part where \\(a^2b^2\\) is taken from the first part and any term is taken from the second part. But that's not correct because each term in the product is a combination. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the sum over all possible ways to get \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part and any term from the second part. But that seems complicated. Alternatively, maybe the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, so it's the product of the coefficients from each part where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2, and the exponents of \\(c\\) are 0. So, that would be 6 times 20, which is 120. Therefore, I think the coefficient is 120.\n\nWait, but to make sure, let me consider a simpler case. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Let's expand this. \\((a + b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2\\). \\((c + 1/c)^1 = c + 1/c\\). So, the product is \\(a^2(c + 1/c) + 2ab(c + 1/c) + b^2(c + 1/c)\\). Expanding this, we get \\(a^2c + a^2/c + 2abc + 2ab/c + b^2c + b^2/c\\). Now, if I look for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), there is none because \\(a^2b^2\\) isn't present in this expansion. So, the coefficient would be 0. But according to my previous logic, the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) in the first part is 1 (from \\(a^2\\)), and the constant term in the second part is 0 because \\((c + 1/c)^1\\) has no constant term. So, 1 times 0 is 0, which matches. So, that seems correct.\n\nAnother example: \\((a + b)^3 \\times (c + 1/c)^2\\). Let's see. \\((a + b)^3 = a^3 + 3a^2b + 3ab^2 + b^3\\). \\((c + 1/c)^2 = c^2 + 2 + 1/c^2\\). Now, the product would include terms like \\(a^3c^2\\), \\(3a^2bc^2\\), etc. Now, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), let's see. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) would come from multiplying \\(a^2b\\) from the first part by \\(ab\\) from the second part, but wait, the second part doesn't have an \\(ab\\) term. Wait, no, the second part is in terms of \\(c\\), so maybe the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would only come from \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the constant term in the second part. But in this case, the first part doesn't have an \\(a^2b^2\\) term because it's \\((a + b)^3\\), which only goes up to \\(a^3\\) and \\(b^3\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 0. Alternatively, if I had \\((a + b)^4\\) times something, then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient from the first part times the constant term from the second part. So, in our original problem, since \\((a + b)^4\\) has \\(a^2b^2\\) with coefficient 6 and the second part has a constant term 20, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times 20, which is 120.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^4 \\times (c + 1/c)^6\\). The term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6, and the term \\(c^0\\) in the second part is 20. So, when I multiply these two, I get 6 times 20, which is 120, and that's the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is just \\(a^2b^2\\). If I wanted the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some \\(k\\), that would involve other terms, but since the problem is only asking for \\(a^2b^2\\), it's just the product of the coefficients from each part where the exponents match to give \\(a^2b^2\\) and \\(c^0\\).\n\nSo, to summarize: The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times 20, which is 120.\n\nWait, but let me check if I made a mistake in calculating the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). The expansion is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^6 \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), \\(m = 3\\). So, the term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} c^0 = 20\\). That's correct. So, the constant term is 20. And the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is indeed 6. So, 6 times 20 is 120. Therefore, the coefficient is 120.\n\nI think that's the correct answer. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning now.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem, which is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Next, the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by setting the exponent of \\(c\\) to zero, which occurs when \\(m = 3\\), giving \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying these coefficients together gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."
