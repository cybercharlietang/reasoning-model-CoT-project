    "text": " I know that \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) can be expanded using the binomial theorem as well. The general term in the expansion is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k\\). Simplifying that, each term becomes \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} c^{-k} = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). Now, I need to find the value of \\(k\\) such that the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, because I'm looking for the constant term (i.e., \\(c^0\\)). So, set the exponent equal to 0: \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the term where \\(k = 3\\) will be the constant term. The coefficient of this term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Let me compute that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20.

So, multiplying them together: 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120. Let me just double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake. First, expanding \\((a + b)^4\\) gives me the term \\(a^2b^2\\) with a coefficient of 6, that's correct. Then, expanding \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), I found that the constant term is when \\(k = 3\\), which gives me 20, that seems right. Multiplying 6 and 20 gives 120. I think that's correct. Alternatively, maybe I should consider whether the entire expression is a product, so each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part would be multiplied by the constant term in the second part, which is 20, so the total coefficient is indeed 6 * 20 = 120. Yeah, that makes sense.

    "text": " I'm going to use the binomial theorem again for this part. The expression is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), so expanding this, we get \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k\\). Simplifying each term, that becomes \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} c^{-k} = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, each term has an exponent of \\(6 - 2k\\). We want the term where the exponent is 0, because that's the constant term. So, set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Now, putting it all together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Since these two terms multiply together in the original expression, the overall coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Wait, let me just make sure I didn't make a mistake here. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\) as 6, and the term \\(c^0\\) comes from the other expansion as 20. When you multiply these two, you get 6 * 20 = 120, and that's the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression. That makes sense because when you expand \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part is multiplied by the constant term from the second part, which is 20, giving 6 * 20 = 120. I don't think I made any mistakes here, but let me double-check the binomial coefficients just to be sure. For \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\), 4 choose 2 is indeed 6, because 4! / (2!2!) = (24)/(2*2) = 6. And for \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\), 6 choose 3 is 20, because 6! / (3!3!) = (720)/(6*6) = 720/36 = 20. Yep, that's correct. So, multiplying 6 and 20 gives 120. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120. I think that's the answer. Let me just write it out again to make sure I didn't skip any steps. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Multiplying these together gives 6 * 20 = 120. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120. I don't think I missed anything here. The key was realizing that when you multiply two polynomials, the terms combine by multiplying each term from the first polynomial with each term from the second.

Hmm, that seems straightforward. But let me double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nFirst, expanding \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem: correct.

Each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} (1/c)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We need the exponent to be zero, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\) gives \\(k = 3\\). So, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\): correct.\n\nMultiplying the two coefficients: 6 * 20 = 120: that's correct.\n\nWait, but let me consider if there's another way to approach this problem, just to verify.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of the entire expression as a product of two independent expansions, and since we're looking for a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), it's only the product of the \\(a^2b^2\\) term and the constant term in the \\(c\\) expansion. So, that's exactly what I did. So, that seems consistent.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can consider generating functions or multinomial coefficients, but in this case, since the variables are separate, I think the approach is correct.\n\nWait, another thought: is the problem perhaps asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), but written as \\(a^2b^2\\)? Because in the product, the term would have \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is just \\(a^2b^2\\). So, that's correct.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, just to make sure, let me compute \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) again: 4! = 24, 2! = 2, so 24/(2*2) = 6: correct.\n\nAnd \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\): 6! = 720, 3! = 6, so 720/(6*6) = 720/36 = 20: correct.\n\nSo, 6 * 20 is indeed 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is 120.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't miss any cross terms or something. For example, is there a possibility that another term from the \\(c\\) expansion could combine with \\(a^2b^2\\) to give a term without \\(c\\)? No, because \\(a^2b^2\\) is from the first expansion, and any term from the second expansion would have some power of \\(c\\), unless it's the constant term. So, only the constant term would multiply with \\(a^2b^2\\) to give a term without \\(c\\), which is what we're interested in.\n\nTherefore, I think my approach is correct, and the coefficient is 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break down the problem into two parts:\n\n1. **Finding the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\):**\n   Using the binomial theorem, we know that \\((a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\\).

    "text": " Hmm, okay, so I need to expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) and find the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0. Again, I can use the binomial theorem here. The binomial theorem says that \\((x + y)^n = \\sum_{k=0}^{n} \\dbinom{n}{k} x^{n - k} y^k\\). In this case, \\(x = c\\) and \\(y = \\dfrac{1}{c}\\), and \\(n = 6\\). So, expanding this, each term will be \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k\\). Let me simplify that term. \\(\\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = c^{-k}\\), so the exponent of \\(c\\) in each term is \\(6 - k - k = 6 - 2k\\). We want the exponent to be 0, so we set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\) so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the term where the exponent is 0 is when \\(k = 3\\). So, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Let me compute that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20.

Since these two terms are multiplied together in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) (times \\(c^0\\)) is the product of these two coefficients. So, 6 multiplied by 20 is 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120. Let me just double-check my reasoning to make sure I didn't make a mistake. First, I found the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) correctly using the binomial coefficient, which is 6. Then, I considered that when multiplying by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), I only need the constant term (with \\(c^0\\)) because any other term would introduce a \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), which would make the product have a term that includes \\(c\\), but we're only interested in the \\(a^2b^2\\) term, which doesn't involve \\(c\\). So, I correctly identified that I need the constant term from the second expansion. I used the binomial theorem again, found that the exponent of \\(c\\) is \\(6 - 2k\\), set that equal to 0, solved for \\(k = 3\\), and found the coefficient as 20. Multiplying 6 and 20 gives 120, which seems correct. I don't think I made any calculation errors here.

The general term in the expansion is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k\\). Simplifying that, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} c^{-k} = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, the exponent of \\(c\\) in each term is \\(6 - 2k\\). We need the exponent to be 0 because we're looking for the term \\(c^0\\). So, let's set up the equation: \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the term where \\(k = 3\\) is the constant term. So, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20.

Since these two terms are multiplied together in the product, the overall coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake here. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the product of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and \\(c^0\\) in the second part, because any other term would involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), which would make the product have a \\(c\\) term, but since we're only looking for the term without \\(c\\), it's just 6 times 20. Yeah, that makes sense. So, the coefficient is 120. Let me just recap to make sure I didn't miss anything. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product of two expansions: \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). To get \\(a^2b^2\\), we only need the term from \\((a + b)^4\\) where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present, which is 6, and the term from the other expansion that doesn't have any \\(c\\), which is 20. Multiplying these together gives 120. I don't think there are any other terms that would contribute to \\(a^2b^2\\) without introducing a \\(c\\) term, so I think this is correct. \n\nWait, let me double-check my binomial coefficients. For \\((a + b)^4\\), \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) is indeed 6. For \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term where the exponent is 0 is when \\(k = 3\\), so \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, 6 times 20 is 120. Yep, that seems right. I don't think I made any calculation errors here. So, the coefficient should be 120. \n\nAlternatively, I can think of it this way: when you multiply two expressions together, each term in the first expression multiplies each term in the second expression. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first part, and the term \\(c^0\\) comes from the second part. Since these are independent, their coefficients multiply. So, 6 times 20 is 120. That seems consistent. \n\nI guess another way to look at it is that the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, if I expand both, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is a combination of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms, and each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is a combination of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) terms. The only way to get a term that's just \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) is to multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first expansion by the \\(c^0\\) term from the second expansion. All other products would involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), which we don't want. So, that's why we only need to consider those two coefficients and multiply them together. \n\nLet me just confirm once more that \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) does indeed have a \\(c^0\\) term when \\(k = 3\\). Plugging \\(k = 3\\) into the exponent \\(6 - 2k\\), we get \\(6 - 6 = 0\\), so yes, that's correct. The coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). \n\nSo, putting it all together, the coefficient is 6 times 20, which is 120. I think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning, so I feel confident that 120 is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break down the problem into two parts:\n\n1. **Expanding \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\):\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\n   \\]\n   So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\n2. **Expanding \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n   \\]\n   We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0:\n   \\[\n   6 - 2k = 0 \\implies k = 3\n   \\]\n   The coefficient is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\n   \\]\n\n3. **Combining the coefficients:**\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficients from the two expansions:\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 20 = 120\n   \\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\) as 6, and the term \\(c^0\\) comes from the other expansion as 20, so when multiplied together, it's 6 * 20 = 120. That seems right. Alternatively, I can think of it as the entire expression being the product of two expansions, so each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) gets multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion will be multiplied by the constant term in the second expansion, which is 20, giving 6 * 20 = 120. So, yes, the coefficient should be 120. Let me just make sure I didn't make any calculation errors. \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) is indeed 6, because 4! is 24, and 2! is 2, so 24/(2*2) = 6. Then, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\) is 20 because 6! is 720, 3! is 6, so 720/(6*6) = 720/36 = 20. So, 6 * 20 is 120. That seems correct. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is 120. I think that's the answer. Let me just recap to make sure I didn't miss anything. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product of two expansions. The first expansion is \\((a + b)^4\\), and the second is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Since we're only interested in terms that result in \\(a^2b^2\\), and those terms don't involve \\(c\\), we can focus on the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part.

We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, which means \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20.

Simplifying each term, that becomes \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} c^{-k} = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, each term has an exponent of \\(6 - 2k\\) on \\(c\\). I need the term where the exponent is 0, because that's the constant term. So, I set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\) and solve for \\(k\\). \\(6 - 2k = 0\\) implies \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\).

Multiply these two coefficients together: 6 * 20 = 120. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120. I think that's it. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning.

So, expanding it, we get \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k\\). Let me simplify the general term: \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\times c^{-k}\\) because \\(\\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = c^{-k}\\). So, combining the exponents, \\(c^{6 - k - k} = c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We're looking for the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, which means \\(6 - 2k = 0\\).

Since we're multiplying these two expressions together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product will be the product of these two coefficients, because the \\(c^0\\) term doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. So, 6 multiplied by 20 is 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 120. Let me just double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake. First, I found the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6. Then, I expanded \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) and found the coefficient of \\(c^0\\), which is 20. Multiplying them together gives 6 * 20 = 120. That seems correct. I don't think I made any calculation errors. Let me just verify the binomial coefficients again. \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) is indeed 6, because 4!/(2!2!) = 24/(2*2) = 24/4 = 6. And \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\) is 20 because 6!/(3!3!) = 720/(6*6) = 720/36 = 20. Yep, that checks out. So, I think I'm confident that the coefficient is 120. So, the final answer should be 120. But just to make sure, let me think if there's another way to approach this problem. Alternatively, maybe I can consider that when multiplying the two expansions, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) will multiply each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). However, since we're only interested in terms where the result has \\(a^2b^2\\), we only need to consider the term from \\((a + b)^4\\) that is \\(a^2b^2\\) and multiply it by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, no, that's not quite right. Because when you multiply, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second. But since the second expansion has terms with \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), unless we're looking for terms that are multiplied by \\(c^0\\), the resulting term would have a \\(c\\) term, which we don't want. So, in order to get a term that only has \\(a^2b^2\\), we must multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by the constant term in the second expansion. So, that's why we needed to find the constant term in the second expansion and then multiply it by the coefficient from the first expansion. So, that confirms my earlier approach.

Let me just double-check to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. First, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Then, in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term where the exponent is 0 is when \\(k = 3\\), which gives \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying 6 and 20 gives 120. Yeah, that seems correct. I don't think I made any errors in the calculations. So, the final answer should be 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is found by considering the product of two binomial expansions. \n\n1. Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n2. Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n3. Multiply these coefficients together: \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

    "text": " I remember that the binomial theorem can also be applied here. The expression is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), so expanding this using the binomial theorem gives \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k\\). Simplifying each term, that becomes \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} c^{-k} = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, each term has an exponent of \\(c\\) equal to \\(6 - 2k\\). We want the term where the exponent is 0, so we set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(6 = 2k\\) which means \\(k = 3\\). So, the term where \\(k = 3\\) will have \\(c^0\\). The coefficient for this term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Let me compute that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Now, going back to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the other part is 20. Since we're multiplying these two expressions together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will come from multiplying the \\(a^2b^2\\) term (which is 6) by the constant term (which is 20). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Wait, is that all? Let me double-check. So, \\((a + b)^4\\) gives \\(a^2b^2\\) with coefficient 6, and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) gives \\(c^0\\) with coefficient 20. When you multiply these, the term \\(a^2b^2 \\times c^0\\) will have a coefficient of 6 * 20 = 120. So, that should be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression. Let me see if there's another way to approach this problem or if I might have missed something. Alternatively, maybe I can think of the entire expansion as a product of two polynomials and consider how the terms interact. But since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are different variables, the only way to get a term with \\(a^2b^2\\) is to take the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first polynomial and the \\(c^0\\) term from the second polynomial. Taking any other terms from the second polynomial would introduce a \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\) term, which would make the term have \\(c\\) raised to some power, but since we're only interested in \\(a^2b^2\\), those terms don't contribute to the coefficient we're looking for. So, I think my approach is correct. Therefore, the coefficient is 120. Wait, just to make sure, let me compute \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\) again. 6 choose 3 is 20, right? Because 6*5*4/(3*2*1) = 20. Yep, that's correct. And 4 choose 2 is 6, that's correct too. So, 6 times 20 is indeed 120. So, I think that's the right answer.

Well, no, because the second polynomial only has terms with \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), so any other term would introduce a \\(c\\) factor, making the product have a \\(c\\) term, but since we're only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term without \\(c\\), only the constant term from the second polynomial would contribute.
