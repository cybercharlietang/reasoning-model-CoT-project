Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is indeed the product of the coefficients from each part, which is 6 \u00d7 20 = 120. So, I think that's the answer.

Therefore, the coefficient is 6 times 20, which is 120. Let me see if I made any mistakes here. First, I correctly identified that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. Then, I correctly expanded \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) and found that the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Multiplying these together gives 120. Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe I can think of it as the entire expression being the product of two independent expansions, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is indeed 6 times 20. I think that's right. So, the final coefficient is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is found using the binomial coefficient \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). In \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying these gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\boxed{120}."
