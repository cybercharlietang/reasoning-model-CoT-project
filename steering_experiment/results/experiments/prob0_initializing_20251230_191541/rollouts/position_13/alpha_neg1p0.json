    "text": " Now, the expression also includes \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I wonder if I need to expand this part as well. But wait, the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\). So, does that mean the coefficient is just 6, and the rest of the terms involving \\(c\\) don't affect it? Hmm, maybe. Let me think again. The entire expression is the product of two expansions: one in terms of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and another in terms of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). Since the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are multiplied by terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), but the problem is only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\), then perhaps I don't need to consider the expansion of the \\(c\\) terms. Wait, but maybe I'm misunderstanding. Let me clarify: when they say \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", are they considering the entire expression, including the \\(c\\) terms? Or are they just looking for the coefficient in the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) part? Hmm, the way the problem is phrased, it's \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), and they're asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, that would imply that \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term in the product, but since the other part is in terms of \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the same as in \\((a + b)^4\\) because when you multiply by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but the \\(a^2b^2\\) term is only multiplied by constants from the other expansion. Wait, but actually, no. Because when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Wait, that doesn't sound right. Let me think again. Let me write it out more formally. Let me denote \\(A = (a + b)^4\\) and \\(B = \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Then the product is \\(A \\times B\\). So, any term in \\(A\\) is of the form \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}a^{4 - k}b^k\\) for \\(k = 0\\) to \\(4\\), and any term in \\(B\\) is of the form \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - m}\\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, when we multiply \\(A\\) and \\(B\\), each term in \\(A\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(B\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(A\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}a^2b^2\\), which is \\(6a^2b^2\\). When we multiply this by each term in \\(B\\), we get terms like \\(6a^2b^2 \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, in the product \\(A \\times B\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^{6 - 2m}\\) would be \\(6 \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}\\) for each \\(m\\). But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), without any restriction on the power of \\(c\\). So, that would mean we need to consider all the terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any power of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the sum over all \\(m\\) of \\(6 \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}\\). Wait, but that's just 6 times the sum of \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\) for \\(m = 0\\) to \\(6\\). The sum of binomial coefficients \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\) from \\(m = 0\\) to \\(6\\) is \\(2^6 = 64\\). So, the coefficient would be \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). Wait, is that correct? Let me check. Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think: when you have two independent expansions, the coefficient of a specific term in one expansion is multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the other expansion. So, in this case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, the total coefficient would be \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). That seems to make sense. Let me verify this with a simpler example to see if this approach is correct. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). The coefficient of \\(a^2b^0\\) in the first part is \\(\\dbinom{2}{0} = 1\\). The sum of coefficients in the second part is \\((1 + 1) = 2\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^0\\) in the product would be \\(1 \\times 2 = 2\\). Let's expand it manually: \\((a + b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2\\). \\((c + 1/c)^1 = c + 1/c\\). Multiplying these together: \\(a^2(c + 1/c) + 2ab(c + 1/c) + b^2(c + 1/c)\\). The coefficient of \\(a^2\\) is indeed 1 times (c + 1/c), so the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) in the product is 1*(1 + 1) = 2, which matches. So, yes, the approach seems correct. Therefore, applying this to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times 64, which is 384. Wait, but let me think again. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), so that would indeed be the sum over all possible coefficients from the \\(c\\) terms, multiplied by 6. So, 6 times 64 is 384. Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the \\(a^2b^2\\) term is multiplied by each term in the \\(c\\) expansion, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the \\(c\\) expansion, which is 64, giving 384. So, I think that's the correct answer. But wait, let me just make sure I'm not missing anything. Another way to think about it is: the expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). The \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms are independent of \\(c\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). As we calculated, the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. That seems consistent. Alternatively, if the problem had asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some specific \\(k\\), then we would have to compute it differently, but since it's just \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\), the coefficient is 384. So, I think that's the answer.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is found by first determining the coefficient in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Then, since the expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the sum of all coefficients in this part is \\(2^6 = 64\\). Multiplying these together gives \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n**Answer:**  \n\\boxed{384}"

    "text": " Now, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I need to consider how the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), affects this term. Wait, but hold on, the second part involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), which are separate variables from \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). So, when we multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since we're only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), that means we just need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and then multiply it by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, no, that doesn't make sense because when you multiply two expressions, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) are separate variables, the only way \\(a^2b^2\\) can appear in the product is if we take the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part and multiply it by the constant term (i.e., the term with \\(c^0\\)) from the second part. Because if we take any other term from the second part, it would involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), which would make the term have \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or similar, but we just want \\(a^2b^2\\). So, to clarify, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is equal to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). That makes sense because when you multiply the two expansions, the only way to get a term with only \\(a^2b^2\\) is to multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by the constant term from the second expansion. So, I've already found that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. Now, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me apply the binomial theorem again. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying each term, that becomes \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m} = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, each term has an exponent of \\(c\\) equal to \\(6 - 2m\\). We need the term where the exponent is 0 because we want the constant term. So, set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Now, going back to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the two coefficients we found: 6 (from \\(a^2b^2\\)) multiplied by 20 (from \\(c^0\\)). So, 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 120.\n\nWait, let me double-check to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. So, first, I found the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial coefficient \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). That seems right because \\((a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\), so yes, the coefficient is 6.\n\nNext, for \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), I needed the constant term, which occurs when the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0. Using the binomial expansion, the general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\). Setting \\(6 - 2m = 0\\) gives \\(m = 3\\), so the term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}c^0 = 20\\). That seems correct.\n\nMultiplying these together gives 6 * 20 = 120, which should be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression. Wait, but let me think again: when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. But the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is just a scalar multiple, right? So, when I multiply it by the entire second expansion, it's like scaling each term in the second expansion by 6. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which comes from multiplying \\(a^2b^2\\) by the constant term in the second expansion, which is 20, so 6 * 20 = 120. That seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of the entire expression as the product of two independent expansions, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) would be 6 * 20 = 120, and since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is the same as \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), that's 120. Hmm, that makes sense.\n\nWait, but another way to look at it is that when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each polynomial, provided that their variable parts multiply to give the desired term. In this case, since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are in the first polynomial and \\(c\\) is in the second, the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) is to take the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first and the constant term from the second, which we did. So, yes, 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nI think that's solid. So, the coefficient is 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break down the problem into two parts using the binomial theorem.\n\n1. **Expanding \\((a + b)^4\\):**\n   Using the binomial theorem, we know that:\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\), so the coefficient is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\n   \\]\n\n2. **Expanding \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   Using the binomial theorem, we know that:\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n   \\]\n   The constant term (where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0) occurs when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which gives \\(m = 3\\).

But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), perhaps the value from the second part doesn't affect it? Or maybe I'm misunderstanding. Let me think.

So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), then any term in the second expansion that has \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\) will be multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2 \\times \\dfrac{1}{c^k}\\). But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which implies that the other parts (like \\(c\\) terms) should not be present.

Unless... unless the problem is considering the entire product and wants the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. But that doesn't seem right either. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, considering all possible terms, regardless of the \\(c\\) part. But that seems a bit unclear. Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me read the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" Hmm, so perhaps the term \\(a^2b^2\\) can be multiplied by any term from the second part, but we're only interested in the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. Wait, but that doesn't make sense because when you multiply, you have to consider all possible combinations. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, treating \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) as separate variables. But then, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, so the coefficient would actually be the sum of all the coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by 6 (the coefficient from the first part). But that would mean the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(6 \\times\\) the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but the sum of coefficients in a polynomial is found by setting all variables to 1. So, if I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of coefficients in the second part is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). But wait, that seems too straightforward. Let me check again. Alternatively, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, considering that the second part could contribute any power of \\(c\\), but since we're only interested in \\(a^2b^2\\), the coefficient would be the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all coefficients from the second part. That is, because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, each term contributes a different power of \\(c\\), but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, we sum all the coefficients from the second part and multiply by 6. So, that would be 6 times 64, which is 384. But wait, let me think again. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which would mean that the coefficient is indeed 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, giving 384. Alternatively, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem, and it's actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), i.e., the term where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out, so that the term is just \\(a^2b^2\\). That would make more sense, because otherwise, the coefficient would depend on the power of \\(c\\). So, maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\), i.e., 1. So, in that case, I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\) in the product. That makes more sense. So, in that case, the approach would be to first find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), and then multiply those two coefficients together. So, let's do that. First, as before, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. Now, for the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\). Let me expand this using the binomial theorem. The expansion is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k - k} = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). So, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part is 20. Now, since the two parts are multiplied together, the overall coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let me check the steps again. First, \\((a + b)^4\\) gives \\(a^2b^2\\) with coefficient 6. Then, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) gives \\(c^0\\) term when \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), so \\(k = 3\\), and the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying 6 and 20 gives 120. That seems correct. Alternatively, if I had considered the entire product, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part, which includes various powers of \\(c\\). But since we're only interested in the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, we only take the term from the second part that is \\(c^0\\), which has coefficient 20. Therefore, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\) is 6 * 20 = 120. So, I think that's the correct answer. But just to be thorough, let me consider an alternative approach. Let me think about the entire expansion. The product is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). When expanding, each term will be of the form \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k \\times \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\times (1/c)^m\\), which simplifies to \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}\\dbinom{6}{m} a^{4 - k}b^k c^{6 - 2m}\\). Now, we're looking for the term where \\(a^{4 - k}b^k = a^2b^2\\), which implies \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). So, \\(k = 2\\), and the coefficient from the first part is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Now, for the second part, we need \\(c^{6 - 2m} = c^0\\), so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which gives \\(m = 3\\). The coefficient from the second part is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, the term is \\(6 \\times 20 a^2b^2c^0 = 120 a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient is indeed 120. I think that confirms it.

    "text": " Now, the expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Hmm, so the entire expression is the product of two expansions. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), maybe we don't need to worry about the other terms involving \\(c\\). Wait, that might not be right because when you multiply two expressions, each term from the first expression gets multiplied by each term from the second. But since the second expression doesn't have \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), maybe the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are independent of the terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, perhaps the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, that doesn't seem right because when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficients combine. Wait, no, actually, since the two parts are multiplied together, any term from the first part will be multiplied by any term from the second part. But since the second part doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part, because each term in the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part. But that can't be right because the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would then be 6 times something, but I think I'm misunderstanding something here. Wait, perhaps the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), is independent of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), so when you multiply the two expressions, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. But then, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in the second expansion. Wait, that seems a bit off. Alternatively, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating \\(c\\) as another variable. But then, since \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) are variables, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would have a coefficient that is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem doesn't specify any constraints on \\(c\\), so perhaps it's just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). Wait, but that doesn't make much sense because the coefficient would then include terms with \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), because that would be the constant term in the second expansion. Hmm, that might make sense. So, perhaps I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product. That would mean that in the first part, I have \\(a^2b^2\\), and in the second part, I have \\(c^0\\), which is the constant term. So, let me think about that. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). That seems plausible. So, I already found that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. Now, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me work on that. Again, using the binomial theorem, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, each term has an exponent of \\(6 - 2m\\). I need the term where the exponent is 0, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product is 6 multiplied by 20, which is 120. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120. Wait, but the problem didn't specify anything about \\(c\\), so maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), which would mean that the coefficient would include terms from the second expansion. But that doesn't make much sense because the coefficient should be a numerical value, not a polynomial. Therefore, I think the correct interpretation is that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. Let me double-check my steps. First, I found the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6. Then, I found the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 20. Multiplying these together gives 6 * 20 = 120. That seems correct. Alternatively, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without considering \\(c\\), then the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which would be a polynomial in \\(c\\). But I think the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, so it's more likely that it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplying it by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20. Thus, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\boxed{120}"

So, does that mean that the entire \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) part doesn't affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)? Hmm, maybe not. Wait, no, because when you multiply two expressions, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term in the first part, and the second part involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), which don't have \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), so maybe the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would just be the coefficient from the first part, and the second part doesn't affect it. Wait, but that doesn't seem right. Let me think again. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when you expand this, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), that would mean that when you multiply, the \\(c\\) terms must cancel out so that the resulting term is just a constant times \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, but that can't be right because \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) will have terms involving \\(c^6\\), \\(c^4\\), \\(c^2\\), \\(c^0\\), \\(c^{-2}\\), \\(c^{-4}\\), and \\(c^{-6}\\). So, when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each of these, you get terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), etc. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of just \\(a^2b^2\\), which would require that the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. So, in other words, we need to find the term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) that has \\(c^0\\), because when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), it would give \\(a^2b^2 \\times c^0 = a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Therefore, I need to compute both coefficients and then multiply them together. Let me confirm that. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\) with coefficient 6, as I found earlier. Now, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Let me use the binomial theorem again for this part. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(1/c\\right)^m\\). Simplifying that, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\times c^{-m} = \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be zero, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Now, the total coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the two coefficients I found: 6 (from \\((a + b)^4\\)) and 20 (from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\)). So, 6 multiplied by 20 is 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120.\n\nWait a second, let me double-check that. So, in the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6. In the second part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term with \\(c^0\\) is when \\(m = 3\\), so the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, when you multiply the two expansions together, each term from the first expansion is multiplied by each term from the second. So, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part gets multiplied by each term from the second part, including the constant term. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is indeed 6 * 20 = 120. I think that makes sense. So, I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning. Therefore, the coefficient is 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem.\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\):\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\n   \\]\n   So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\n2. **Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n   \\]\n   We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0:\n   \\[\n   6 - 2m = 0 \\implies m = 3\n   \\]\n   The coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\n   \\]\n\n3. **Combine the coefficients:**\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the product of the coefficients from each expansion:\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 20 = 120\n   \\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

    "text": " Now, the original expression also has \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I wonder if I need to consider this part as well. Wait, the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which are variables in the first part. The second part involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), which are different variables. So, does that mean that the terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) don't affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)? I think so because \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\). So, maybe the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just 6, and the other part doesn't contribute anything to it. Let me think again. The entire expression is the product of two expansions: \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When you multiply two polynomials, each term from the first polynomial is multiplied by each term from the second polynomial. However, since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are different variables, the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) in the product will only come from the first part, and the exponents of \\(c\\) will come from the second part. So, if I'm looking for a term that has \\(a^2b^2\\), it would be the product of the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first expansion and any term from the second expansion. But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), I think the coefficient would just be the same as the coefficient from the first part, which is 6. Wait, but that doesn't seem right because when you multiply two expressions, the coefficients multiply as well. Let me check that again. If I have \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), and I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), that term in the product would be \\(6 \\times\\) something from the second expansion. But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, I think the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion. But wait, that would be 6 times \\(2^6\\) because each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) has a coefficient of 1, and there are \\(2^6 = 64\\) terms. But that would mean the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times 64, which is 384. But that doesn't seem right because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not considering \\(c\\). Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), and when you multiply it by any term from the second part, which is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term from the second part will have some power of \\(c\\), but the problem is only asking about \\(a^2b^2\\), so the coefficient would be the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients from the second part. But wait, the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 times 64, which is 384. But that seems high. Alternatively, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. That would make more sense because otherwise, the coefficient would depend on the power of \\(c\\), which isn't specified. So, if that's the case, I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product. That would require me to consider both expansions and find the term where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out. Let me try that approach.\n\nFirst, let's find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which we already determined is 6.\n\nNext, let's find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). To do this, we can use the binomial theorem again. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\).\n\nWe want the exponent of \\(c\\) to be 0, so we set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\).\n\nThe coefficient for \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n\nNow, since the entire expression is the product of \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) would be the product of the coefficients from each part, which is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nWait, that makes more sense. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, considering that \\(c\\) terms must cancel out, is 120. But the problem didn't specify anything about \\(c\\), so maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me read the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" It doesn't specify anything about \\(c\\), so perhaps the coefficient is simply 6, because the \\(c\\) terms don't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. But that doesn't feel right because when you multiply two polynomials, each term from the first is multiplied by each term from the second. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 64, giving 384. But that seems too large. Alternatively, maybe the problem is only asking for the coefficient in the first part, ignoring the second part. But that can't be right because the entire expression is the product of both parts. So, perhaps the correct approach is to realize that when you multiply the two expressions, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by every term in the second expansion, each contributing a different power of \\(c\\). However, since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. The sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\nBut wait, I'm now confused because earlier I thought the problem might be asking for \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), but the problem didn't specify. Let me check the problem statement again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" It just says the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), without mentioning \\(c\\). So, in the product, each term will have some combination of \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) can be multiplied by any power of \\(c\\), but the coefficient would still be the same because the coefficients from the second part are multiplied by the coefficients from the first part. Wait, no. Actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients from the second part. Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, each term contributes its coefficient, and since \\(a^2b^2\\) is being multiplied by all those terms, the total coefficient would be 6 times 64, which is 384.\n\nBut I'm not entirely sure. Let me think differently. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. Now, when I multiply this by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, which includes terms like \\(c^6\\), \\(6c^4\\), \\(15c^2\\), \\(20\\), \\(15c^{-2}\\), \\(6c^{-4}\\), and \\(c^{-6}\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would actually be \\(6 \\times (c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15c^{-2} + 6c^{-4} + c^{-6})\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\), but the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for any \\(k\\) would be \\(6 \\times\\) the coefficient of \\(c^k\\) in the second expansion. However, the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), without specifying \\(c\\). So, perhaps the answer is 6, because the \\(c\\) terms are separate. But that doesn't make sense because when you multiply, the coefficients do combine. Wait, no, because in the product, each term is a product of terms from both expansions. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) would be \\(6 \\times\\) the coefficient of \\(c^k\\) in the second expansion. But since the problem is just asking for \\(a^2b^2\\), without any \\(c\\) terms, it's actually asking for the coefficient when \\(k = 0\\), i.e., the constant term with respect to \\(c\\). So, that would be \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120.\n\nWait, that makes sense. Because if you think about it, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but in the context of the entire expression, which includes \\(c\\) terms. So, to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), you have to consider all possible \\(c\\) exponents, but that's not the case. Actually, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) would be \\(6 \\times\\) the coefficient of \\(c^k\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is ambiguous. It could mean the coefficient when considering all possible \\(c\\) exponents, which would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 times 64 = 384. Alternatively, it could mean the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. I think the correct interpretation is that it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), so the answer is 120.\n\nBut to be thorough, let me check both interpretations.\n\nFirst interpretation: The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\). In this case, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nSecond interpretation: The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nI think the problem is more likely asking for the second interpretation because otherwise, it would be a bit strange to ask for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without considering the \\(c\\) terms. So, the answer is 120.\n\nBut wait, let me make sure. Let's think about how the product works. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first expansion, and it's multiplied by every term in the second expansion. So, each term in the product will have \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by some power of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product isn't a single number because \\(a^2b^2\\) can be multiplied by different powers of \\(c\\), each with their own coefficients. So, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), it must be referring to the coefficient when considering all possible \\(c\\) exponents, which would be the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by 6. That would be 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but that seems contradictory. Because in the product, each term is a product of terms from both expansions, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) is 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^k\\) in the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) term doesn't make sense because \\(a^2b^2\\) is always multiplied by some power of \\(c\\). Therefore, the problem must be asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nI think that's the correct approach. So, the coefficient is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is found by considering both parts of the product. First, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. Next, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Multiplying these gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\boxed{120}."

So, when I multiply the two expansions, the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) will only come from the first part, and the terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) will only come from the second part. Therefore, the product will have terms like \\(a^k b^m c^n\\) or \\(a^k b^m (1/c)^n\\), etc. But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), that term would be independent of \\(c\\), right? Because \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\). So, to get \\(a^2b^2\\), I need to take the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part and multiply it by the term that is a constant (i.e., \\(c^0\\)) from the second part. Because any term with \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\) would make the product have \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), which isn't part of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I already found that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. Now, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me think about how to do that. Again, I can use the binomial theorem for this. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k\\). Simplifying each term, that becomes \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} c^{-k} = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). I need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, because \\(c^0 = 1\\), which is the constant term. So, I set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(6 = 2k\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Now, going back to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficients from each part, since \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first part and the constant term from the second part. Therefore, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Wait, let me just double-check that. So, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, and in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Multiplying them together gives 120. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120. I think that makes sense because when you multiply the two expansions, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But since we're only interested in the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2, and the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, we only need the specific coefficients from each part. So, yeah, I think 120 is the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is found using the binomial theorem, which gives \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). The constant term (coefficient of \\(c^0\\)) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying these coefficients together gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\(\\boxed{120}\\)"

Wait, does that mean I don't need to consider the \\(c\\) terms? Because \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), right?

We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20.

So, when we multiply these two terms together, the coefficient becomes 6 * 20 = 120, and the term is \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is just \\(a^2b^2\\). So, that should be the coefficient. Hmm, but wait, is there any other way this could happen? Like, maybe I'm missing something where other terms could contribute to \\(a^2b^2\\). Let me think. No, because any term involving \\(c\\) would add an exponent to \\(c\\), which would make the term \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) where \\(k\\) isn't zero, so those wouldn't contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\).

So, when I multiply these two expressions, the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) will be multiplied by the terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). But since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), maybe the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is just the coefficient from the first part, and the second part's expansion doesn't affect it? Wait, that doesn't sound right. Let me think again. Actually, when you multiply two expressions, each term in the first expression is multiplied by each term in the second expression. But since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are in the first expression and \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) are in the second, the product terms would be of the form \\(a^kb^{4 - k} \\times c^m (1/c)^{6 - m}\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be from the first part, and then it would be multiplied by some term from the second part. But since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), perhaps it's only multiplied by the constant term in the second expression. Wait, but the second expression is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Let me check if there's a constant term there. A constant term would be when the exponents of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) cancel each other out. So, in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{m} \\left(1/c\\right)^{6 - m} = \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{2m - 6}\\). For this to be a constant term, the exponent of \\(c\\) should be zero. So, \\(2m - 6 = 0\\) implies \\(m = 3\\). So, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Let me calculate that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20. Therefore, when I multiply the two expressions, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by the constant term 20 from the second part. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the second part), which is 6 * 20 = 120. Wait, but let me make sure I'm not missing anything. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient would just be the product of the coefficients from each part. So, 6 from the first part and 20 from the second part, giving 120. Alternatively, if I thought about the entire product, maybe I should consider that each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second. But since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term from the first expansion, and to get \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, it must be multiplied by the constant term from the second expansion. So, that's 6 * 20 = 120. Alternatively, maybe I should think that the entire expression is a product of two polynomials, and the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the sum over all possible products where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) add up to 2 each, but since the second part doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), the only term that contributes is when we take \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part and multiply it by the constant term from the second part. So, yes, that's 6 * 20 = 120. Alternatively, maybe I can think of the entire expression as a product, so the coefficient would be 6 (from the first part) multiplied by the sum of the coefficients of all terms in the second part, but that's not right because each term in the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part. But since we're only interested in \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), the only contribution comes from multiplying \\(a^2b^2\\) by the constant term in the second part. So, 6 * 20 = 120.

The expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{m} (1/c)^{6 - m} = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{2m - 6}\\). So, when does \\(2m - 6 = 0\\)? When \\(m = 3\\), as I had before. So, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, that's correct. Therefore, the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120.

Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" Hmm, so perhaps the problem is considering the entire expansion as a single expression, and looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). But that doesn't seem right because \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term that's separate from the \\(c\\) terms. Alternatively, maybe the problem is considering the product, and the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is being multiplied by some combination of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), but the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would mean that any terms involving \\(c\\) would have to be considered as separate coefficients. Wait, that doesn't make sense because \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term without \\(c\\), so perhaps the coefficient is just the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but that would make the coefficient a polynomial in \\(c\\), not a single number. Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try another approach. Perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where the exponents of \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are 2, 2, and 0 respectively. That would make sense because then it's a specific term in the expansion. So, if that's the case, then I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), and then multiply those two coefficients together. That seems more reasonable. So, let's proceed with that understanding.\n\nFirst, as I found earlier, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\nNext, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). To do that, I can use the binomial theorem again. So, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(1/c\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be 0, so we set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which gives \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\).\n\nNow, since the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by the term \\(c^0\\) from the second part, the total coefficient is the product of the two coefficients: \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake here. So, the first part gives 6 for \\(a^2b^2\\), and the second part gives 20 for \\(c^0\\), so when you multiply them, you get 120 as the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is just \\(a^2b^2\\). So, yes, that makes sense.\n\nAlternatively, if I didn't consider the \\(c\\) terms and just multiplied the entire expansion, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually be a polynomial in \\(c\\), but the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which I think refers to the term where the exponents of \\(c\\) are zero. So, I think my approach is correct.\n\nWait, but let me check again. If I expand \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) separately, then when I multiply them, each term from the first expansion is multiplied by each term from the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, which includes various powers of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the sum of \\(6 \\times\\) each coefficient from the second expansion. But that's not correct because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would include all the possible \\(c\\) terms. Wait, no, that can't be, because \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term without \\(c\\). So, perhaps the only way \\(a^2b^2\\) can appear in the product is if it's multiplied by \\(c^0\\), so the coefficient would be \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\), as I thought earlier.\n\nWait, another way to think about it: the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). When you multiply these two, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would be the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by 6. But that's not possible because \\(a^2b^2\\) can only be multiplied by terms that don't involve \\(c\\), otherwise, the term would have \\(c\\) in it. So, the only term that would result in \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) is when it's multiplied by the \\(c^0\\) term from the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient is 6 times 20, which is 120.\n\nWait, but let me confirm that. So, if I have \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by \\(c^k\\), that would give a term \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), but the problem is only asking for \\(a^2b^2\\), which would mean \\(k = 0\\). Therefore, the coefficient is indeed 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion, which is 20, so 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nI think that's correct. Let me just recap: the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 20. Multiplying these gives 120, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120.\n\nI don't think I made any mistakes in the calculations. The binomial coefficients seem right, and the logic about the exponents makes sense. So, I'm confident that the answer is 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break down the problem into two parts using the binomial theorem.\n\nFirst, we consider the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\). Using the binomial theorem, we have:\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n\\]\nWe need the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2, which corresponds to \\(k = 2\\). The coefficient for this term is:\n\\[\n\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\n\\]\n\nNext, we consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem, we have:\n\\[\n\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n\\]\nWe need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, which occurs when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\) gives \\(m = 3\\). The coefficient for this term is:\n\\[\n\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\n\\]\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficients from the two expansions:\n\\[\n6 \\times 20 = 120\n\\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}."

Since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and the second part of the product, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), it seems like the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be the coefficient from the first part multiplied by whatever constant comes from the second part, right? Wait, but actually, no, because the second part might contribute a term that affects the overall coefficient. Wait, no, actually, since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are only in the first part, the second part doesn't affect their exponents. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part, but since we're only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and that term doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), maybe the coefficient is just 6 times whatever the constant term is in the second expansion. Wait, no, that doesn't make sense. Let me think again. The entire expression is a product of two expansions. So, when you multiply them, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But since we're only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), that means we need to find the term where in the second expansion, the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, so that when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), we don't get any \\(c\\) terms. So, perhaps I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) and then multiply it by the coefficient from the first part. Let me check that. So, the second part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me expand this using the binomial theorem as well. The expansion would be \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying that, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\times c^{-m} = \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which implies \\(m = 3\\). So, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the constant term from the second part, which is 20. So, 6 times 20 is 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120. Let me double-check that. So, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6. In \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the constant term is 20. Multiplying them gives 120. That seems correct. I don't think I made any mistakes here.

So, does that mean that the coefficients for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will just be the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part? Wait, but that doesn't seem right because the second part is a separate variable. Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again. So, the expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). If I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), then I need to consider how \\(a^2b^2\\) interacts with the other terms. But since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are only in the first part, and \\(c\\) is only in the second part, when I multiply them together, the terms will be products of terms from each expansion. So, for \\(a^2b^2\\), it's only going to come from the first part, and the second part will contribute a term that's a power of \\(c\\). But wait, the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). Or is it? Wait, no, I think the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, which includes all possible powers of \\(c\\). But actually, I think that's not the case. Wait, let me read the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" Hmm, so it's the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but in the entire product. So, perhaps I need to consider that the coefficient is multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), so the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, that doesn't make sense because when you multiply two expressions, the coefficients multiply. Wait, no, let me think differently. When you have two polynomials multiplied together, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each polynomial. But in this case, the first polynomial is in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the second is in \\(c\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part will multiply every term in the second part, each of which is a power of \\(c\\). But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), without any restriction on the power of \\(c\\), perhaps the coefficient is just 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Wait, but that would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Alternatively, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But let me check that. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^k\\) for some specific \\(k\\), but the problem doesn't specify, so perhaps it's just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), which would mean that we need to consider all possible terms. But that seems a bit odd because the product would have terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), etc., each with their own coefficients. So, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), meaning the constant term with respect to \\(c\\). That would make more sense. So, perhaps I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\) in the product. So, let me assume that. So, the coefficient would be 6 (from the \\(a^2b^2\\) term) multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, now I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Let me expand \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem. So, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(1/c\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, we need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, which means \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), \\(6 = 2m\\) so \\(m = 3\\). So, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\) in the entire product is 6 times 20, which is 120. So, the answer should be 120. But wait, let me double-check. Alternatively, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But the sum of coefficients in a polynomial is found by setting all variables to 1. So, \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). So, 6 times 64 would be 384. But that seems too large, and I think the problem is more likely asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), which is 120. Hmm, I'm a bit confused. Let me read the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" It doesn't specify any condition on \\(c\\), so perhaps it's just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times any power of \\(c\\).

But the problem is asking for a coefficient, which is a number, so I think the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), that is, the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\).

When you multiply these two expressions, the variables involved are \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\), but the term \\(a^2b^2\\) only involves \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), not \\(c\\). So, in the product, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, that can't be right because the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is a sum of terms involving \\(c\\), and when you multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), each term would have \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by some term in \\(c\\). So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term without \\(c\\). Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, perhaps the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is present in the expansion of the product, and we need to find its coefficient, which would include any constants from the second part. Wait, but the second part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when you expand that, you get terms like \\(c^6\\), \\(6c^4\\), \\(15c^2\\), \\(20\\), \\(15c^{-2}\\), \\(6c^{-4}\\), \\(c^{-6}\\). So, when you multiply by \\((a + b)^4\\), which has terms up to \\(a^4b^0\\) and \\(a^0b^4\\), the product will have terms like \\(a^4b^0c^6\\), \\(a^4b^0 \\times 6c^4\\), and so on. But the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would only come from the product of the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in \\((a + b)^4\\) and the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because if you take any other term from the second expansion, like \\(c^k\\) where \\(k \\neq 0\\), then when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), you would get a term involving \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), which is not just \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the only term that would contribute to \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part multiplied by the constant term from the second part. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, first, I found that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. Now, I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). To find the constant term, I can use the binomial theorem again. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k\\). Simplifying the exponents, that becomes \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k - k} = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). The constant term occurs when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. So, we set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20. Now, putting it all together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the two coefficients we found: 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the second part). So, 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120. Wait, let me double-check that. So, the first coefficient is 6, and the second coefficient (constant term) is 20, so 6*20=120.

But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms.

But that can't be right because the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) vary depending on the power of \\(c\\). Wait, no, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me think again. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but in the entire expression, which is the product of two expressions. So, perhaps the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part, but since the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, that would mean that the coefficient is just \\(6\\) times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, that doesn't seem right because each term in the second part has different powers of \\(c\\), so when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each of those terms, you get different terms in the product, but the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be \\(6\\) times the sum of the coefficients in the second part. Wait, but actually, no. Because in the product, each term from the first polynomial is multiplied by each term from the second, so the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by every term in the second part. So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) times each term in the second expansion would contribute to different terms in the final product. But the problem is asking specifically for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so that would be the coefficient from the first part times the coefficient from the second part when the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out. Wait, no, perhaps I'm making a mistake here. Let me try another approach. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, if I expand both parts separately, then multiply them together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of the second part. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients in the second part. Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, you're effectively scaling \\(a^2b^2\\) by each coefficient in the second expansion, and when you collect like terms, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the sum of all those scalings. Wait, but that doesn't sound quite right. Let me think again. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^4 = A_0 + A_1a + A_2a^2b + A_3a^3b^2 + A_4a^4b^3\\), but actually, it's more precise to say that each term is \\(a^{4 - k}b^k\\) with coefficients. But in any case, when I multiply this by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is another polynomial in \\(c\\), each term from the first polynomial is multiplied by each term from the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part, which has a coefficient of 6, is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients in the second polynomial \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because each term in the second polynomial contributes its own coefficient when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), and since we're just interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, it's as if we're summing all the coefficients from the second part. Wait, but that seems a bit off. Let me check: the sum of the coefficients in a polynomial is found by substituting 1 for each variable. So, the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) would be when \\(c = 1\\), so \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 * 64 = 384. But wait, that seems too straightforward, and I'm not sure if that's correct. Alternatively, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), that is, the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2 each, and the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0. Because otherwise, if it's just \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\), then the coefficient would indeed be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second part, which is 6 * 64 = 384. But perhaps the problem is intended to ask for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would require a different approach. Let me re-examine the problem statement: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" It just says \\(a^2b^2\\), so maybe it's okay to consider that \\(c\\) can be any power, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to have the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning that the \\(c\\) terms must cancel out. Let me try that approach. So, if I need the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), that would mean that in the product, the exponents of \\(c\\) must sum to zero. So, let's see. First, from \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, as we found earlier. Now, from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, because when we multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), the total exponent of \\(c\\) would be whatever exponent comes from the second part. So, to get \\(c^0\\), we need the term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0. So, let's find that term. Using the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We need the exponent \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), so solving for \\(k\\): \\(6 - 2k = 0 \\implies 2k = 6 \\implies k = 3\\). So, the term where \\(k=3\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} c^{0} = 20\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. So, putting it all together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire product is 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient is 120. But wait, the problem just says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", not \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). So, maybe the answer is 384, as I thought earlier. But that seems contradictory because if you don't specify \\(c\\), then you're considering all possible powers of \\(c\\), which would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which is 6 * 64 = 384. However, in that case, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by every possible power of \\(c\\), so the coefficient would indeed be 384. But I'm a bit confused because usually, when someone asks for the coefficient of a term in a product, they might be implying that they want the coefficient when all variables are present, but in this case, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), so perhaps it's intended to just consider the coefficient in the first part, which is 6, and then the second part is irrelevant because it's multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\). Wait, no, that can't be right because the entire product would have terms involving both \\(a, b\\) and \\(c\\). So, perhaps the correct interpretation is that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second part, which is 6 * 64 = 384. But then, that would mean that \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, each contributing their own coefficient, so when you collect all the terms, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second part. Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it, and the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and the second part is irrelevant because it's multiplied by any term. But that doesn't make sense because the entire expression is a product, so each term from the first part is multiplied by each term from the second part. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the sum of the coefficients in the second part. So, 6 times 64 is 384. Alternatively, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it's 6 times 20, which is 120. But since the problem didn't specify \\(c^0\\), I think the correct approach is to assume that it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which would be 384. However, I'm not entirely sure, so maybe I should check both interpretations. Let me think: if I take the product \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), then the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, in the product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be present in every term where it's multiplied by a term from the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all coefficients from the second part. So, that would be 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it's 6 * 20 = 120. But since the problem didn't specify \\(c^0\\), I think the answer is 384. Wait, but I'm not entirely confident. Let me try to see if that makes sense. If I have \\((a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\), and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15/c^2 + 6/c^4 + 1/c^6\\). So, when I multiply these together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part would be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times each coefficient in the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^6\\) is 6*1, coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^4\\) is 6*6, coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^2\\) is 6*15, coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is 6*20, and so on. So, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, then it's the sum of all these coefficients, which is 6*(1 + 6 + 15 + 20 + 15 + 6 + 1) = 6*64 = 384. But if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it's 6*20 = 120. Since the problem just says \\(a^2b^2\\), I think it's the first case, so the answer is 384. But wait, that seems like a lot. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to have the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), so 120. Hmm. I'm a bit confused. Let me try to clarify. The problem is: What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the expression is a product of two polynomials. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) is in the first polynomial, and when multiplied by the second polynomial, each term in the second polynomial will contribute to terms in the product that have \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by different powers of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial. Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second polynomial, you're effectively scaling \\(a^2b^2\\) by each coefficient, and when you collect like terms, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the sum of all those scalings. So, the sum of the coefficients in the second polynomial is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 * 64 = 384. So, I think that's the correct answer. Alternatively, if the problem had asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it would be 6 * 20 = 120, but since it's just \\(a^2b^2\\), it's 384.\n\nWait, but I just realized something. When you multiply two polynomials, each term from the first is multiplied by each term from the second. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial. Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second polynomial, you get terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), etc., each with their own coefficients. But if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, then it's the sum of all those coefficients. So, that would be 6 * (sum of coefficients in the second polynomial) = 6 * 64 = 384. So, I think that's the correct approach.\n\nBut wait, let me verify with a smaller example to make sure. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^1 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, expanding, it's \\((a + b)(c + 1/c)\\). The coefficient of \\(a^1b^0\\) in the first part is 1. The sum of coefficients in the second part is (1 + 1) = 2. So, the coefficient of \\(a^1b^0\\) in the product would be 1 * 2 = 2. Let's see: the product is \\(ac + a/c + bc + b/c\\). The coefficient of \\(a\\) is 1 (from \\(ac\\)) + 1 (from \\(a/c\\)) = 2, which matches. So, in this case, the approach works. Similarly, if I have \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\), the coefficient of \\(a^1b^1\\) is \\(\\dbinom{2}{1} = 2\\). The sum of coefficients in the second part is 2. So, the coefficient of \\(a^1b^1\\) in the product would be 2 * 2 = 4. Let's check: \\((a + b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2\\). Multiply by \\((c + 1/c)\\): \\(a^2c + a^2/c + 2abc + 2ab/c + b^2c + b^2/c\\). The coefficient of \\(ab\\) is 2 from \\(2ab\\) in the first part, but when multiplied by \\((c + 1/c)\\), it becomes \\(2abc + 2ab/c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(ab\\) in the product is 2 * (1 + 1) = 4, which matches. So, this approach seems correct. Therefore, applying it to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought that the problem might be asking for \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be 120. But according to the smaller example, the approach of multiplying the coefficient from the first part by the sum of coefficients from the second part is correct when you're looking for the coefficient of a term that doesn't involve the other variables. So, in this case, the answer should be 384.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let me also compute the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be 6 * 20 = 120. So, depending on the problem's intent, both answers could make sense, but given that the problem didn't specify \\(c^0\\), I think 384 is the correct answer.\n\nWait, but in the problem statement, it's written as \\(a^2b^2\\), without any \\(c\\) terms. So, in the product, \\(a^2b^2\\) is being multiplied by each term in the second polynomial, which includes various powers of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would indeed be the coefficient from the first part times the sum of the coefficients from the second part, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nSo, after going through this step-by-step, I think the coefficient is 384.\n\nWait, but I just remembered that in the product, each term is a combination of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms and \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) terms. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part, which includes different powers of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is indeed the coefficient from the first part times the sum of the coefficients in the second part. So, 6 * 64 = 384. Therefore, the answer is 384.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check by actually expanding both parts and multiplying. For \\((a + b)^4\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) has a coefficient of 6. For \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the sum of coefficients is \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, when multiplied, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{384}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem and properties of polynomial multiplication.\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\), so the coefficient is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\n   \\]\n\n2. **Consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   The sum of the coefficients in this expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\):\n   \\[\n   \\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\n   \\]\n\n3. **Combine the results:**\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is the product of the coefficient from the first part and the sum of the coefficients from the second part:\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 64 = 384\n   \\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{384}\\)."

    "text": " Now, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part will be multiplied by every term in the expansion of the second part. But wait, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so I think I might have misunderstood. Wait, no, because the second part involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), which are different variables. So, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the variables \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, but since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), it's actually the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times the entire second expansion. Wait, no, that can't be right because the second expansion doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\). So, actually, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part, but since the second part doesn't affect \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just the coefficient from the first part times the entire second part. Wait, that doesn't make sense because the second part is being multiplied, so the coefficient would be the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all the terms in the second part. But no, that's not correct because we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is just the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part, but since we're only interested in the coefficient, and the second part doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just 6 times the entire expansion of the second part. Wait, no, that can't be right because the second part is a separate expansion. Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again.\n\nSo, the expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). When you multiply two expressions together, each term in the first expression is multiplied by each term in the second expression. So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I need to find all the terms in the first expansion that have \\(a^2b^2\\) and then multiply them by each term in the second expansion. But since the second expansion doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire second expansion. But that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, not an expression involving \\(c\\). Hmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)\". Wait, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, in other words, when you multiply the two expressions, each term in the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second part, and the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be present in the product for each term in the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients in the second part. Wait, that might be it. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times 64, which is 384. But wait, that seems too straightforward. Alternatively, maybe I'm supposed to consider that the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, so the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by each term in the second expansion, but since we're just looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\), it's 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is indeed 64. So, 6 * 64 = 384. Therefore, the coefficient is 384.\n\nWait, but let me double-check that approach. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) because when you multiply, the exponents of \\(c\\) might cancel out. Let me think about that. So, if I have \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), when I expand them, each term in the first will be multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, which is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(1/c\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, each term in the second expansion is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). Therefore, when I multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each of these terms, I get \\(a^2b^2 \\times \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the sum over all \\(k\\) of \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} \\dbinom{6}{k}\\), because the coefficient from the first part is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\) and from the second part, for each \\(k\\), it's \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}\\). Wait, but that would mean the coefficient is 6 times the sum of \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}\\) for \\(k = 0\\) to \\(6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384, as before. So, that seems consistent.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it by considering each term. Since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\), it's just the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the entire second expansion. But since the second expansion is a polynomial in \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will indeed be 6 times the entire second expansion, but since we're looking for a numerical coefficient, perhaps it's 6 times the sum of the coefficients of the second expansion, which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me think again. If I have two polynomials, P(a, b) and Q(c), then the coefficient of a certain term in P(a, b) * Q(c) would be the coefficient in P(a, b) times the entire Q(c). But since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of c's exponents, it's just 6 * Q(c). But that would mean the coefficient is 6 * Q(c), which is a polynomial in c, but the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, so perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question. Wait, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where the exponents of c cancel out. Let me check that possibility.\n\nSo, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), that would mean in the product, the term where the exponent of c is zero. So, from the first part, I have \\(a^2b^2\\), and from the second part, I need a term where the exponent of c is zero. So, in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term with \\(c^0\\) is when the exponent is zero. So, in the expansion, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, setting \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), we get \\(k = 3\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} \\times \\dbinom{6}{3} = 6 \\times 20 = 120\\). So, that would be 120. But wait, the problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", without specifying anything about c. So, perhaps the problem is indeed asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where c's exponent is zero. Alternatively, maybe it's just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of c's exponent, in which case it would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which would be 6*(64) = 384, but that seems more complicated.\n\nWait, let me check the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)\". So, it's possible that the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the powers of c. So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of the second part, which is a polynomial in c. But the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, so perhaps that's not the case. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), i.e., the term where the exponents of a, b, and c are 2, 2, and 0 respectively. That would make sense because otherwise, the coefficient would be a polynomial in c, which seems unlikely for this problem.\n\nSo, perhaps the correct approach is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). So, in that case, as I calculated earlier, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part is 20. So, multiplying them together, 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient is 120.\n\nWait, but let me think again. The problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", without mentioning c. So, perhaps it's just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of the powers of c. In that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which would be 6*(64) = 384. But that seems odd because the coefficient would then be a polynomial in c, which doesn't make sense as a numerical coefficient. So, perhaps the problem is indeed asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be 120.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me try to think of it as a single expression. So, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). When you expand this, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, which are various powers of c. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient from the first part, 6, multiplied by each coefficient from the second part. But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of c, the total coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. The sum of coefficients in the second expansion is found by setting c = 1, so \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but that seems to make sense because when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in one polynomial times the sum of all coefficients in the other polynomial gives the total coefficient for that term across all possible combinations. So, in this case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6, and the sum of all coefficients in the second part is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nBut earlier, I thought maybe it's asking for the coefficient where c's exponent is zero, which would be 120. So, which is it? Let me check the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)\". It doesn't specify anything about c, so I think the correct interpretation is that we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the powers of c. So, that would mean 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but I'm confused because in the expansion, each term would have a specific power of c, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually be a polynomial in c. So, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is a specific term where the exponents of a, b, and c are 2, 2, and 0 respectively. That would make more sense because otherwise, the coefficient would involve c, which isn't possible for a numerical coefficient.\n\nSo, to clarify, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then we need to find the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\). So, in the first expansion, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, and in the second expansion, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\), because as I calculated earlier, \\(6 - 2k = 0\\) implies \\(k = 3\\). So, 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient is 120.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of c's exponent, then it would be 6 times the entire second expansion, which would be 6*(64) = 384. But that would mean the coefficient is 384 times \\(c^0\\) plus other terms with different powers of c, which doesn't make sense as a single numerical coefficient. Therefore, I think the correct interpretation is that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nWait, but let me check again. The problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\". It doesn't mention c at all. So, perhaps it's just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, regardless of the powers of c. So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which would be a polynomial in c. But the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, so that can't be right. Therefore, perhaps the problem is indeed asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nWait, let me try to think differently. Maybe the problem is written as \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), and we're to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, perhaps the variables a and b are separate from c, so the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, which are all terms involving c. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which would be a polynomial in c. But the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, so perhaps it's a misinterpretation. Alternatively, maybe the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating c as a separate variable, so the coefficient would be 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but that seems unlikely.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider that the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where the exponents of a, b, and c are 2, 2, and 0 respectively. That would make sense because otherwise, the coefficient would involve c, which isn't possible as a numerical value. So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is simply to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of c, which would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. But that would mean the coefficient is 384 times \\(c^0\\) plus other terms, which seems odd.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Let me try to approach it differently. Let's consider that the expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). When you expand this, each term in the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, which are \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the sum over all k of \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} \\dbinom{6}{k}\\), which is 6 times the sum of \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}\\) from k=0 to 6. The sum of \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}\\) is \\(2^6 = 64\\), so 6 * 64 = 384. Therefore, the coefficient is 384.\n\nBut then again, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), it's 120. So, which one is correct? Let me think about the wording: \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\". It doesn't specify anything about c, so perhaps it's indeed 384. But that seems counterintuitive because the coefficient would then be a polynomial in c, which doesn't make sense as a numerical coefficient. Therefore, I think the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nWait, perhaps I should look for another approach. Let me consider that the entire expression is a product of two independent expansions. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6, and the second part is a separate expansion in c. So, when you multiply them, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is 6*(64) = 384, but that seems incorrect because the coefficient should be a number, not a polynomial.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating c as a separate variable, so the coefficient would be 6 times the expansion in c, which would be 6*(64) = 384, but that would mean the coefficient is 384, which is a number, not a polynomial. Wait, no, because the expansion in c is a separate factor, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would indeed be 6 times the entire expansion in c, which is 64, so 6*64 = 384. Therefore, the coefficient is 384.\n\nWait, but that seems to make sense because when you multiply two polynomials, each term in one is multiplied by each term in the other. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 64. So, 6*64 = 384.\n\nBut then, if I were to write the entire product, it would be \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which expands to a sum of terms involving \\(a^kb^{4 - k}c^{6 - 2m}1/c^m\\), etc. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 64, so 6*64 = 384.\n\nBut that seems to be the case. So, perhaps the correct answer is 384. But earlier, I thought it might be 120. Hmm, I'm confused.\n\nWait, let me try to approach it differently. Let me consider that the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of the powers of c. So, that would mean that for each term in the product, if it has \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the c exponents, we include it. So, the coefficient would be the sum over all terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present, each multiplied by their respective c exponents. But since the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, perhaps it's just the coefficient from the first part times the entire second expansion, which is 6*64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it, and the problem is simply to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which would be the product of the coefficients from each part, but that doesn't make sense because the second part is a separate expansion.\n\nWait, perhaps I should think of it as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) being 6, and since the second part is a separate expansion, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 times the entire expansion of the second part, which is 64, so 6*64 = 384.\n\nBut I'm still not entirely sure. Let me check with an example. Suppose I have (a + b)^1 * (c + 1/c)^1. Then, the expansion is (a + b)(c + 1/c) = ac + a/c + bc + b/c. The coefficient of a^1b^0 would be (1 choose 1)* (1 choose 0) = 1*1 = 1 for ac, 1*1 = 1 for a/c, etc. But if I'm looking for the coefficient of a^1b^0, it's 1*(c + 1/c), which is c + 1/c. But that's a polynomial in c, not a numerical coefficient. So, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of a^2b^2c^0, which would be 6*20 = 120.\n\nWait, that makes sense because in the example, the coefficient of a^1b^0c^0 would be 1*1 = 1, which is the coefficient when c^0 is considered. So, in the original problem, the coefficient of a^2b^2c^0 would be 6*20 = 120.\n\nTherefore, I think the correct answer is 120.\n\nWait, but let me confirm. If I expand \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. If I expand \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. So, when I multiply these two expansions, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by the \\(c^0\\) term from the second part, resulting in \\(6 * 20 = 120\\) for the term \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is 120. Since the problem didn't specify the exponent of c, but just asked for \\(a^2b^2\\), perhaps it's implying \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), making the answer 120.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of c's exponent, then it would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which would be 64, so 6*64 = 384. But that would mean the coefficient is 384 times \\(c^0\\) plus other terms, which doesn't make sense as a numerical coefficient.\n\nTherefore, I think the correct interpretation is that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nWait, but let me check again. If I set c = 1, then \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = 64\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 * 64\\) would be 6*64 = 384. So, if I set c = 1, the coefficient becomes 384. But if I set c = 1, I'm effectively evaluating the expression at c = 1, which gives the sum of coefficients, but that's not the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\).\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is indeed asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of c's exponent, which would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), so 64, making it 384. But then, the coefficient would be a polynomial in c, which isn't possible as a numerical value. Therefore, I think the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nAfter all this thinking, I believe the correct answer is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by considering the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion and the term \\(c^0\\) from the second expansion. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). In \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying these gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\boxed{120}."

    "text": " Now, the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Hmm, but wait, I'm only asked about the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, does that mean that the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by every term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)? Or is there a specific term in the second expansion that affects this? Wait, no, the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product. So, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think: The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, when you multiply two expressions, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. But since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which only comes from the first part \\((a + b)^4\\), and the second part doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\) at all. So, maybe the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just 6 times whatever the constant term is in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), because otherwise, if there are other terms, they would involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), which would make the term not just \\(a^2b^2\\) but something like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or similar. So, perhaps the coefficient we're looking for is 6 times the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). That makes sense because the constant term would be the term without any \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), so when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), it would just give \\(a^2b^2\\) with the coefficient. So, now I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Let's apply the binomial theorem again. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(1/c\\right)^m\\). Simplifying each term: \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\times c^{-m} = \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, which is the constant term. So, set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\): \\(6 = 2m\\) \u2192 \\(m = 3\\). So, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (the constant term from the second part), which is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Wait, but let me double-check that. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\) with coefficient 6, and the constant term from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 20. So, when you multiply these two parts together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by 20, so the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120. Hmm, that seems right. Alternatively, maybe I can think of it as the entire product's expansion, but since the second part doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms, only the \\(c\\) terms, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) is just the product of the coefficients from each part, which is 6 * 20 = 120. Yeah, that makes sense. So, I think the answer is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplying it by the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20.

Wait, no, that's not right either because each term in the second expansion has its own coefficient, and when you multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), each of those coefficients would be added together for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, perhaps the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but how do I find the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)? I remember that the sum of the coefficients in a polynomial is found by plugging in \\(c = 1\\).

Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 times 64, which is 384. Wait, but that seems too high. Let me check again. Alternatively, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, perhaps I'm correct. Since in the expansion, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), and since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term in \\((a + b)^4\\), when multiplied by each term in the second expansion, it creates terms like \\(a^2b^2 \\times c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2 \\times c^{-k}\\). But the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, all these terms would have \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by some power of \\(c\\), but the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) itself would be the sum of all the coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by 6. So, that would be 6 times 64, which is 384. Hmm, but wait, let me think differently. Maybe I should consider that the second expression, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), when expanded, has terms with different powers of \\(c\\), but when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), each term would contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^k\\) or \\(c^{-k}\\), but the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\). So, that would mean that all the terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any power of \\(c\\) would contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in the second expansion. Since the sum of the coefficients is 64, as I calculated earlier, then 6 times 64 is indeed 384. Wait, but let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, and since the second part doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), it's just 6 times the entire second expansion. But that seems odd because the second expansion isn't a single term. Wait, no, actually, when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, each of those terms would have a coefficient, so the total coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. So, 6 times 64 is 384. Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe I should think about it differently. Let me try expanding both parts separately and then see how they interact.\n\nFirst, let's expand \\((a + b)^4\\). As I did before, using the binomial theorem, the expansion is:\n\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\dbinom{4}{0}a^4b^0 + \\dbinom{4}{1}a^3b^1 + \\dbinom{4}{2}a^2b^2 + \\dbinom{4}{3}a^1b^3 + \\dbinom{4}{4}a^0b^4\n\\]\n\nWhich simplifies to:\n\n\\[\na^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\n\\]\n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6.\n\nNow, let's look at the second part: \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Again, using the binomial theorem, this expands to:\n\n\\[\n\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n\\]\n\nSo, each term in this expansion is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\) for \\(k\\) from 0 to 6.\n\nNow, when we multiply the two expansions together, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, resulting in terms like \\(6a^2b^2 \\times \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\).\n\nBut the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, each of these terms contributes to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times some power of \\(c\\). However, if we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without considering the \\(c\\) terms, then the coefficient would be the sum of all the coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by 6. Because each term in the second expansion has a coefficient, and when multiplied by \\(6a^2b^2\\), it contributes to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^{6 - 2k}\\). But since we're not considering the \\(c\\) terms, we just sum all those coefficients and multiply by 6.\n\nWait, but that's not exactly right. Because each term in the second expansion is a separate term, so when you multiply by \\(6a^2b^2\\), each term becomes \\(6 \\times \\dbinom{6}{k} a^2b^2 c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, each of these terms has a coefficient of \\(6 \\times \\dbinom{6}{k}\\), and the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is present in each of them. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the sum over all \\(k\\) from 0 to 6 of \\(6 \\times \\dbinom{6}{k}\\). But wait, that would be 6 times the sum of \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}\\) from \\(k = 0\\) to 6, which is 6 times \\(2^6\\) because the sum of binomial coefficients for \\(n = 6\\) is \\(2^6 = 64\\). So, 6 times 64 is indeed 384.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should think of it as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) being 6, and the entire second expansion is a generating function for the coefficients of \\(c\\). So, when multiplied by 6, each term in the second expansion contributes to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^{6 - 2k}\\), but since we're just looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\), it's as if we're summing all the coefficients from the second expansion and multiplying by 6. So, that gives 6 times 64, which is 384.\n\nWait, but let me double-check this approach. Suppose I have two polynomials, P(a, b) and Q(c). The product P(a, b) * Q(c) would have terms where each term in P is multiplied by each term in Q. So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of a specific term in P, say \\(a^2b^2\\), then in the product, that term would be multiplied by every term in Q, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2 \\times q_k c^{...}\\), where \\(q_k\\) is the coefficient from Q. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the sum over all \\(q_k\\) multiplied by the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in P, which is 6. So, that would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in Q. Since the sum of coefficients in Q is Q evaluated at c = 1, which is \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\), so 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So, I think the coefficient is 384. But let me just make sure I'm not missing anything. Is there another way to approach this problem? Maybe by considering the entire expansion and looking for the term \\(a^2b^2\\). But since the second part doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), it's just a constant with respect to \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the entire second part. Wait, but that's not quite right because the second part is an expansion with multiple terms. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all coefficients from the second part. Which is exactly what I did before, leading to 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but another way to think about it is: when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in one polynomial is multiplied by the entire other polynomial. So, in this case, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) is being multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is \\(6\\) times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nYes, that seems consistent. Therefore, I think the coefficient is 384.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{384}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem for both parts of the expression.\n\nFirst, we expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n\\]\nWe are interested in the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2, which corresponds to \\(k = 2\\). The coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) is:\n\\[\n\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\n\\]\n\nNext, we consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem:\n\\[\n\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n\\]\nThe sum of all the coefficients in this expansion is found by substituting \\(c = 1\\):\n\\[\n\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\n\\]\n\nWhen we multiply the two expansions together, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient is:\n\\[\n6 \\times 64 = 384\n\\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is \\boxed{384}."

So, I think that means I need to consider the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) as well. But hold on, the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\). So, does that mean that the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)? Or maybe I need to consider the coefficients separately. Hmm, I think I need to clarify that. Let me think: when you multiply two expressions together, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression. So, if I have \\((a + b)^4\\) times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of the second part. But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), I think that the coefficient will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. Wait, but that doesn't make sense because the second part involves \\(c\\), and the term \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\). So, maybe the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is just multiplied by the constant term from the second expansion. Because if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I don't care about the \\(c\\) part, so I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) because that would be the term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), so when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), it remains as a term without \\(c\\). So, the overall coefficient would be the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part. That makes sense. So, first, I found that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. Now, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me try expanding that. Using the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). I need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0. So, set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Therefore, the overall coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the second part), which is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake here. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\) with coefficient 6, and the term \\(c^0\\) comes from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) with coefficient 20. When we multiply these two, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by 20, so the coefficient becomes 6 * 20 = 120. That seems right. Let me check if there's another way to approach this problem. Alternatively, maybe I can consider the entire expansion, but that might be more complicated. I think my approach is correct because I'm separating the parts that involve \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) from those that involve \\(c\\). So, the key is that since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), we only need the constant term from the second expansion, which is 20, and then multiply it by the coefficient from the first part, which is 6. So, 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient is 120.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break the problem into two parts:\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\), so its coefficient is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\n   \\]\n\n2. **Find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n   \\]\n   The term with \\(c^0\\) occurs when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which gives \\(m = 3\\).

Wait, that might not be correct. Let me think again. Alternatively, maybe the coefficient is just the product of the coefficients of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and the entire second part. Wait, but the second part is a sum of terms involving \\(c\\), so when we multiply by \\((a + b)^4\\), each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) gets multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but since we're only interested in the \\(a^2b^2\\) term, we can take the coefficient from the first part and then multiply by the entire second expansion, because the second expansion doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. So, perhaps the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that might not be the case. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are separate variables, the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) gives terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) gives terms involving \\(c\\). So, when you multiply them, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part. But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Wait, no, that can't be right because each term in the second expansion is a different power of \\(c\\), but when you multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), each term would have a different power of \\(c\\). But the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so maybe it's just 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a single coefficient. Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when you expand the entire expression, considering all variables. But that seems complicated. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, and then considering the second part as a separate term. Wait, that might not make sense. Let me read the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, it's the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product of the two expressions. So, when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), you get a product where each term is a product of a term from the first expansion and a term from the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the first expansion, and when multiplied by any term from the second expansion, it would still be \\(a^2b^2\\) times some power of \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, that would mean that the coefficient is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, multiplied by the entire second expansion. But that would make the coefficient a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the problem is likely expecting a numerical coefficient. Hmm, maybe I'm missing something. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some \\(k\\), but it's not specified. Wait, no, the problem specifically says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", so maybe it's just 6, because the \\(c\\) terms are separate. But that seems too simple. Alternatively, maybe I'm supposed to consider the entire product, and the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but that would be 6 times \\(2^6 = 64\\), so 6 * 64 = 384. But I'm not sure if that's correct. Wait, let me think again. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, when you expand this, each term in the expansion is a product of a term from \\((a + b)^4\\) and a term from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\).

So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Because each term from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) contributes a coefficient, and when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), it just scales the coefficient. So, the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 * 64 = 384. So, I think that's the answer. But let me double-check. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it.

Using the binomial theorem, as I did before, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). So, that's correct.\n\nNow, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Again, I can use the binomial theorem for this. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k\\). Simplifying each term, that becomes \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} c^{-k} = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\).\n\nWe are looking for the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so we set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\).\n\nCalculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\).\n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20.\n\nNow, since the two expansions are multiplied together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product is the product of the coefficients from each expansion. That is, 6 (from \\(a^2b^2\\)) multiplied by 20 (from \\(c^0\\)).\n\nCalculating that, 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is 120.\n\nWait, but let me double-check to make sure I didn't make a mistake. So, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6. In \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0 occurs at \\(k = 3\\), which gives \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying 6 and 20 gives 120. So, yes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of it as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and since the second part, when expanded, has a term \\(c^0\\) with coefficient 20, when you multiply the two, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by 20, so the coefficient becomes 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So, I think I did it right.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then finding the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20. Multiplying these together gives 6 * 20 = 120.\n\n\\boxed{120}"

    "text": " Now, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I think the next step is to consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Again, using the binomial theorem, this would be \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying that, each term becomes \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m} = \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). Now, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), I'm essentially multiplying two polynomials. So, each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). However, since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I can think of this as finding the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and then multiplying it by the entire second part, because \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\). Wait, no, that might not be accurate. Let me think again. Wait, no, actually, the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms are separate from the \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) terms. So, when you multiply two polynomials, the variables are independent. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, that doesn't make sense because \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), so when you multiply by the second part, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) would be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), resulting in terms like \\(6a^2b^2c^{6 - 2m}\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would be the sum of all the coefficients of terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any power of \\(c\\). Wait, but the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in other words, the coefficient would be \\(6\\) multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) contributes a coefficient that, when multiplied by \\(6a^2b^2\\), gives a term with \\(a^2b^2\\) times some power of \\(c\\). But wait, no, that's not correct because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would be the sum of all coefficients from each term in the expansion that includes \\(a^2b^2\\). But actually, since \\(a^2b^2\\) is independent of \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is simply the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, no, that's not quite right. Let me clarify: when you multiply two expressions, the coefficients multiply. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6, and when you multiply by the second part, which is a polynomial in \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial. Wait, but the second polynomial is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), and its sum of coefficients is found by setting \\(c = 1\\). So, the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\((1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times 64, which is 384. Wait, but that seems high. Let me check that again. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that's not correct because when you multiply, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, resulting in \\(6a^2b^2 \\times \\text{each term in the second expansion}\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be \\(6\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which, as I thought before, is 64. So, 6 * 64 = 384. But wait, that seems too straightforward. Let me think again. Alternatively, maybe I should consider that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the powers of \\(c\\), so the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which would mean that the coefficient is 6 times 64, which is 384. But let me confirm this by another method. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is more about combining the expansions correctly. Let me try to write it out more formally. Let me denote the first part as \\(P(a, b) = (a + b)^4\\) and the second part as \\(Q(c) = \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Then, the product is \\(P(a, b) \\times Q(c)\\). Now, when you multiply these two, each term in \\(P(a, b)\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(Q(c)\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(P(a, b)\\) is 6, as I found earlier. Then, when I multiply this by \\(Q(c)\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times each term in \\(Q(c)\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(Q(c)\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384. So, that seems correct. Alternatively, I can think of the entire expression as \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6a^2b^2. Then, when multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial in \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The sum of the coefficients in a polynomial is found by substituting the variable with 1. So, substituting \\(c = 1\\), we get \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384. So, I think that's the correct answer. But just to make sure, let me verify by another approach. Let's consider that \\((a + b)^4\\) has the term \\(a^2b^2\\) with coefficient 6. The second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), can be expanded as \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). When I multiply \\(6a^2b^2\\) by each of these terms, I get \\(6 \\times \\dbinom{6}{m} a^2b^2 c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the sum over all \\(m\\) of \\(6 \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}\\). That is, \\(6 \\times \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m}\\). But \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} = 2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the total coefficient is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). So, that confirms it again. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6. Then, this coefficient is multiplied by the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is \\(2^6 = 64\\). Thus, the overall coefficient is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n\\boxed{384}"

That suggests that maybe the other part of the expression, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), doesn't affect the \\(a^2b^2\\) term, or perhaps it does in some way. Wait, no, actually, when you multiply two expressions together, each term in the first expression is multiplied by each term in the second expression. So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I need to consider how this term interacts with the second part. But hold on, \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term from the first part, and the second part is in terms of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, when I multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by terms from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the result will have terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2 \\cdot c^{-k}\\), but the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, that can't be right because \\(a^2b^2\\) would be part of the expansion, but when multiplied by the second part, it would actually create terms that include both \\(a^2b^2\\) and some power of \\(c\\). So, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\), which is 1. So, I think that's the case. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part needs to be multiplied by the constant term (i.e., the term with \\(c^0\\)) from the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Therefore, to find the overall coefficient, I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and then multiply it by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part. So, now I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me expand that. Again, using the binomial theorem: \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, we want the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0. That is, \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). So, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part is 20. Therefore, the overall coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Wait, let me double-check that. So, from \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, correct. From \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20, correct. So, when you multiply these two parts together, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second. But since we're only interested in the term where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out (i.e., \\(c^0\\)), the only contribution comes from the product of the \\(a^2b^2\\) term and the \\(c^0\\) term. So, 6 times 20 is indeed 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120. I think that's it. Let me just make sure I didn't miss anything. The problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", and since the other part only contributes a scalar multiple (20) when considering the \\(c^0\\) term, the overall coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120.

The second part involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), so maybe it's a separate expansion, but since we're looking for a coefficient that doesn't involve \\(c\\), perhaps we need to find the term in the second expansion that is a constant term, i.e., the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it again. Let me think differently. Maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, that would mean that the coefficient would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).

So, first, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, as I found earlier. Now, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me think about that. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, the exponent of \\(c\\) in each term is \\(6 - 2k\\). We want the term where the exponent is 0, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire product is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120. Wait, but earlier I thought it might be 384, but that was when I considered the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which would give the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients, but that would be if we were looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times any power of \\(c\\), which isn't the case here. The problem specifically asks for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which I think refers to the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\), so the correct coefficient is 120. Let me double-check that. So, in the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. In the second part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. So, when you multiply these two expressions, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by the \\(c^0\\) term from the second part, giving \\(a^2b^2 \\times 20\\). So, the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120. That makes sense. I think I was confused earlier when I considered the sum of all coefficients, but that approach would give the coefficient if we were looking for the entire coefficient when \\(c\\) is set to 1, but the problem is specifically asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which requires the \\(c\\) exponents to cancel out. So, the correct answer should be 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression is found by considering both parts of the product. \n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\)**:\n   - Using the binomial theorem, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) has a coefficient of \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n\n2. **Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)**:\n   - The term with \\(c^0\\) (the constant term) is found when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, which occurs at \\(k = 3\\).\n   - The coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n\n3. **Multiply the coefficients**:\n   - The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer**: The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}."

    "text": " Now, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I think I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which would be the product of the coefficients from each part, right? Wait, no, that's not quite right. Let me think again. The expression is a product of two binomials raised to powers, so when you multiply them, each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I think I can consider the part involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) separately from the part involving \\(c\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\), and it's multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, actually, when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. However, since the second polynomial doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't seem right because the problem is asking for a specific term, \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\). Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me try to clarify. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When you multiply these two expressions together, each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). However, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is just a term with \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and in the second part, the terms involve \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by any term from the second expansion, you'll get terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2 \\times c^{-k}\\), but these are different terms. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) because when you multiply by the other part, you're just adding factors involving \\(c\\), which don't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) parts. So, does that mean the coefficient is just 6? Wait, that seems too simple. Let me double-check. Alternatively, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), because when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the terms could combine in such a way that \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) cancel out. So, maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is the term where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel each other out. That makes more sense because otherwise, if it's just \\(a^2b^2\\), then it's only considering the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) parts, but in the product, every term would have some power of \\(c\\). So, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), which is the constant term with respect to \\(c\\). Let me assume that. So, the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). That makes more sense. So, I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part, then multiply them together. Wait, no, that's not quite accurate because when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial is multiplied by every term in the second polynomial, which includes various powers of \\(c\\). So, to get the term \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), I need to take the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and multiply it by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part. So, the overall coefficient would be the product of the two coefficients. So, let me confirm that approach. First, find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, as I found earlier. Then, find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Once I have both coefficients, multiply them together to get the final coefficient for \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). So, now, let me work on finding the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Again, I can use the binomial theorem here. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k\\). Simplifying each term, that becomes \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} c^{-k} = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). Now, I need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be 0, so I set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(6 = 2k\\) => \\(k = 3\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Now, putting it all together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire product is the product of the coefficients from each part. So, that's 6 (from \\(a^2b^2\\)) multiplied by 20 (from \\(c^0\\)), which is 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient is 120. Wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake here. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is indeed 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 20. Multiplying them gives 120. That seems correct. Alternatively, another way to think about it is that when you expand the entire product, the term \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) comes from multiplying the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first expansion by the \\(c^0\\) term in the second expansion, so the coefficients multiply. So, yes, 6 * 20 = 120. I think that's the correct answer. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break down the problem into two parts using the binomial theorem.\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\):\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\n   \\]\n   So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\n2. **Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n   \\]\n   We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0:\n   \\[\n   6 - 2k = 0 \\implies k = 3\n   \\]\n   The coefficient is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\n   \\]\n   So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20.\n\n3. **Combine the coefficients:**\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product is the product of the two coefficients:\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 20 = 120\n   \\]\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

But wait, does that mean I have to consider the coefficients from the second part as well? Hmm, maybe not exactly. Let me think again. Since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) are separate variables from \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), the terms involving \\(c\\) won't affect the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\).

But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and the second part doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would just be the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all the coefficients from the second part. Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expression, the \\(a^2b^2\\) remains as is, and the coefficients get multiplied. So, the total coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, let me check that again. Let me think of it another way. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4\\) times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). If I expand both, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion is multiplied by every term in the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be \\(6\\) (from the first part) multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients in the second part. Because each term in the second part is a constant (with respect to \\(a\\) and \\(b\\)), so when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), it just scales the coefficient. Therefore, I need to find the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). How do I find the sum of all coefficients in a polynomial? Well, the sum of coefficients is found by plugging in \\(c = 1\\). So, if I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = (2)^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). Wait, but hold on a second. Let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. Because when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is just one term, and it's multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would indeed be the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all coefficients from the second part. So, yes, 6 times 64 is 384. But let me check if I'm interpreting the problem correctly. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or something else. So, yes, because \\(c\\) is a separate variable, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by every term in the second expansion, each of which is a power of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, so 6*64=384. Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe I can think of it as the product of the two expansions. Since the variables are independent, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and the sum of the coefficients in the second part. So, yes, 6*64=384. Alternatively, another way to think about it is that when you have two polynomials multiplied together, the coefficient of a specific term in one polynomial is multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the other polynomial. So, in this case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, and the sum of coefficients in the second polynomial is 64, so the total coefficient is 6*64=384. Wait, but let me make sure I'm not missing anything else. Let me try expanding both parts separately and see. First, \\((a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6. Now, the second part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me expand that using the binomial theorem as well. So, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). The sum of all coefficients in this expansion is when we set \\(c = 1\\), so that's \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\), which matches what I found earlier. So, the sum of coefficients is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 * 64 = 384. So, I think that's the correct answer. But just to be thorough, let me consider another approach. Suppose I consider the entire expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) and I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, which is a function of \\(c\\) only. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384. Yeah, that seems consistent. I think I can be confident that the coefficient is 384.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{384}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem and properties of polynomial multiplication.\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\):\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\n   \\]\n   So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\n2. **Consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n   \\]\n   The sum of all coefficients in this expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\):\n   \\[\n   \\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\n   \\]\n\n3. **Combine the results:**\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is the product of the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) and the sum of the coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 64 = 384\n   \\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{384}\\)."

Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, it's a product of two expressions, one in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the other in \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\).

Wait, but that seems too simple. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\). In that case, we would need to consider the terms where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out, i.e., \\(c^0\\). So, maybe the coefficient is 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). That makes more sense. Let me check that approach. So, first, find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, as I found earlier. Then, find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Then, multiply these two coefficients together to get the final coefficient for \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product. So, let's compute the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).

Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire expression is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Wait, but let me make sure I'm interpreting the problem correctly. The problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\". If the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then it would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which would be a polynomial in \\(c\\), so the coefficient would be 6 times each term, but that doesn't make sense because the coefficient is a scalar. Therefore, I think the correct interpretation is that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\). Therefore, the coefficient is 6 times 20, which is 120. Alternatively, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then it would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But the sum of coefficients in a polynomial is found by setting all variables to 1. So, \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient would be 6 times 64, which is 384. But that seems too high, and the problem probably isn't asking for that. It's more likely that it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. Let me double-check. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\) with coefficient 6. The term \\(c^0\\) comes from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) with coefficient 20. So, when you multiply these, the term \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) has coefficient 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the answer should be 120. But wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in calculating the binomial coefficients. For \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). For \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term where the exponent is 0 is when \\(k = 3\\), so \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, 6 * 20 = 120. Yeah, that seems correct. So, I think the coefficient is 120.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we proceed as follows:\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term with \\(a^2b^2\\) occurs when \\(k = 2\\):\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} a^{2}b^{2} = 6a^2b^2\n   \\]\n   So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\n2. **Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n   \\]\n   We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0:\n   \\[\n   6 - 2k = 0 \\implies k = 3\n   \\]\n   The coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\n   \\]\n\n3. **Combine the coefficients:**\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product is the product of the coefficients from each expansion:\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 20 = 120\n   \\]\n\n**Answer:** \\(\\boxed{120}\\)"

    "text": " But wait, the expression also has \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Hmm, so the entire expression is the product of \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But the question is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). That means I don't need to consider the \\(c\\) terms when looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), right? Because \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\). So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, that doesn't make sense because when you multiply two expressions, the coefficients multiply if the variables are separate. So, if I have \\( (a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 \\), then any term in \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by any term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). However, since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\) at all, that means we're looking for the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2 each, and the exponents of \\(c\\) are 0, because \\(c^0 = 1\\). So, in other words, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, is that correct? Let me think again. When you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term is the sum of the products of coefficients of terms whose exponents add up to the desired term. But in this case, since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are different variables, the exponents don't interfere with each other. So, to get \\(a^2b^2\\), we need the term from \\((a + b)^4\\) that's \\(a^2b^2\\), which we found as 6, and then multiply it by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, that would mean the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion, which isn't a single number. That can't be right because the question is asking for a specific coefficient, which should be a number. So, maybe I misunderstood the problem. Let me check again. The problem says: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, perhaps it's asking for the coefficient of the term that has \\(a^2b^2\\) times any power of \\(c\\). But that would mean the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for a coefficient, which should be a numerical value, not a polynomial. Hmm, that suggests that maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), that is, the term where \\(a\\) is squared, \\(b\\) is squared, and \\(c\\) is to the zero power. Because otherwise, the coefficient would involve \\(c\\) terms, which isn't a single number. Alternatively, maybe the problem is miswritten, and it's supposed to be in a single variable, but that seems unlikely. Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Let me try another approach. Let's consider that the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When we expand this, each term will be of the form \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}a^{4 - k}b^{k} \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - m} \\times c^{-m}\\). Wait, no, that's not quite right. Let me clarify: \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) can be expanded as \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, when we multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term will be \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}a^{4 - k}b^{k} \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the general term is \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}\\dbinom{6}{m} a^{4 - k}b^{k}c^{6 - 2m}\\). Now, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, we need to find all terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) appears, regardless of the power of \\(c\\). But wait, no, actually, in the product, each term has specific exponents for \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would require \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). So, \\(k = 2\\), as before, giving us the coefficient \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). But then, we also have the \\(c\\) part. So, each term in the product will have \\(a^2b^2c^{6 - 2m}\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would include all possible powers of \\(c\\). Wait, but that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because coefficients are numerical. Therefore, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), that is, the term where \\(c\\) is raised to the zero power. That would make sense because then the coefficient would be a number. So, assuming that, we need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product. Therefore, we need to find all terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present and \\(c^0\\) is present. So, from \\((a + b)^4\\), we have \\(a^2b^2\\) with coefficient 6. From \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we need the term where \\(c^0\\), which occurs when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), so \\(m = 3\\). So, the coefficient for \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Let me compute that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product is the product of the two coefficients: 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) (assuming \\(c^0\\)) is 120. Alternatively, if the problem is indeed asking for \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), then the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial, not a single number. But since the problem asks for a coefficient, which is a number, it's more likely that they want the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. So, I think the answer is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is found by considering the expansion of each part separately and then combining the relevant coefficients. \n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\):**  \n   Using the binomial theorem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n\n2. **Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**  \n   We need the term where \\(c^0\\), which occurs when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), so \\(m = 3\\).

The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which only involves \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). The second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). Since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), I think that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would just be the coefficient from the first part, multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part, but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), maybe the second part doesn't affect it. Wait, that doesn't seem right. Let me think again. When you multiply two expressions together, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression. But since the second expression doesn't have \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), only \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), then when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms are independent of \\(c\\).

Wait, but that doesn't make sense because the second part is a separate expansion. Alternatively, perhaps the coefficient is only from the first part because the second part doesn't affect \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). So, maybe the answer is just 6. But that seems too straightforward. Let me check again. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me try to write out the product: \\((a + b)^4\\) is expanded as \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\\), and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is expanded as \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, when you multiply these two expansions together, each term is \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k \\times \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the product is a double sum: \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{4}{k} \\dbinom{6}{m} a^{4 - k}b^k c^{6 - 2m}\\). Now, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, in the product, we're looking for the terms where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2 each. That would occur when \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). So, \\(k = 2\\). Now, the exponent of \\(c\\) in each term is \\(6 - 2m\\), but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), does that mean we need to sum over all possible \\(m\\) values? Wait, no, because each term in the product is a combination of the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) part and the \\(c\\) part. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the sum over all \\(m\\) of the product of the coefficients from each expansion where \\(a^2b^2\\) occurs. But in this case, since \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\(k=2\\) in the first expansion, and for each \\(m\\), the coefficient from the second expansion is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\). So, the total coefficient would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} \\times \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m}\\). Wait, but that would be 6 times \\(2^6\\) because \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} = 2^6 = 64\\). So, 6 times 64 is 384. But that seems high. Wait, but is that correct? Let me think again. When you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each polynomial. But in this case, the first polynomial has terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the second has terms involving \\(c\\). So, when you multiply, the variables \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are all separate. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be present in the product for each term in the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient from the first part (\\(a^2b^2\\)) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients from the second part, because each term in the second expansion, regardless of the \\(c\\) exponent, gets multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) times \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m}\\). Since \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} = 2^6 = 64\\), then the coefficient would be 6 * 64 = 384. So, I think that's the answer. But wait, let me confirm. Alternatively, maybe the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, so it's just 6. But that doesn't seem right because when you multiply by the second expansion, you're effectively scaling each term by the entire second expansion. So, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would indeed be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384.

So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't seem right because the coefficients in the second expansion would affect the overall coefficient. Wait, no. Because when you multiply by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in that expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But the sum of all coefficients in a polynomial is found by plugging in 1 for all variables. So, if I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion is 64. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 * 64 = 384. Wait, but that seems high. Let me check again. Alternatively, maybe I'm supposed to consider that the \\(c\\) terms don't affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so the coefficient remains 6 regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. But that doesn't seem right because when you multiply by the entire second expansion, each term in the first expansion is scaled by the entire second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would indeed be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. But I'm not entirely sure. Let me think differently. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable, so the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the problem is just asking for a numerical coefficient. So, maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), that is, the term where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out, so the term is independent of \\(c\\). That would make more sense because otherwise, the coefficient would involve \\(c\\). So, perhaps I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product. Let me assume that's the case. So, first, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. Now, in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\), which is the constant term. Because when I multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by the constant term in the second expansion, I get a term that's just \\(a^2b^2\\) times that constant, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times that constant term. So, let me find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We want the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(k = 3\\). So, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 * 20 = 120. Wait, but earlier I thought it might be 384, but that was under the assumption that I was summing all coefficients, which might not be the case. So, perhaps the correct approach is to consider the constant term in the second expansion, leading to 6 * 20 = 120. Let me verify this.\n\nSo, to recap: The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. In \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the constant term is 20. Therefore, when you multiply the two expansions, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times the constant term is 6 * 20 = 120. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 120.\n\nBut wait, let me think again. If I'm just looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\), then it would be 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient would be 6 * \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\).

    "text": " Now, the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Hmm, but wait, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is only from the first part, right? So, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I don't need to worry about the \\(c\\) terms unless they affect the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. Wait, actually, no. Because when you multiply two polynomials, each term from the first polynomial is multiplied by each term from the second polynomial. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part will be multiplied by every term in the second part. But the question is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. Wait, but that might not be correct. Let me think again. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, when you expand it, each term will be of the form \\(a^{4 - k}b^k \\times c^{6 - m}(1/c)^m\\) where \\(k\\) ranges from 0 to 4 and \\(m\\) ranges from 0 to 6. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\(k = 2\\), so \\(a^2b^2\\), and it's multiplied by every term in the second expansion, which is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. Wait, but that would mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of all the terms in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that can't be right because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), but the second part is in terms of \\(c\\). So, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Wait, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in other words, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) can be multiplied by any power of \\(c\\), but we just need the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of what's happening with \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. But that would mean the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that doesn't make much sense because the problem is probably expecting a numerical coefficient. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, when you multiply two expressions, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part (which is 6) multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients in the second part. Because each term in the second part is of the form \\(c^{6 - m} \\times c^{-m}\\), which is \\(c^{6 - 2m}\\), but when you multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), the coefficient becomes 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. Wait, but the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\). So, substituting \\(c = 1\\), we get \\((1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of all coefficients in the second part is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 * 64 = 384. But wait, that seems too straightforward. Let me check again. Alternatively, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Perhaps the question is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, but considering all possible terms, including those with \\(c\\). Wait, but \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term without \\(c\\), right? Because \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\). So, perhaps the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is just multiplied by the constant term in the second expansion. Because if I have \\(a^2b^2\\) times, say, \\(c^3\\), that would be a term like \\(a^2b^2c^3\\), but the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would be the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. So, in that case, I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion. So, that would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, let me calculate that. The coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is the same as the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the expansion, which occurs when the exponents from \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) cancel out. So, in the expansion, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\times c^{-m} = \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We want the exponent to be zero, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which gives \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Let me compute that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 * 20 = 120. Wait, so that's different from my previous thought. So, which one is correct? Let me think carefully. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. So, in the product, each term is a combination of terms from both expansions. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term from the second expansion, which includes different powers of \\(c\\). However, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would be the sum of all the coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by the coefficient from the first expansion, but only for the terms where the power of \\(c\\) is zero. Because if the power of \\(c\\) is not zero, then the term would be \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), which is a different term, not just \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, to get the coefficient of exactly \\(a^2b^2\\), we need to consider only the term where the second factor contributes a \\(c^0\\) term. So, that means the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120. So, I think that's the correct answer. Let me verify this again. The first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), gives \\(a^2b^2\\) with coefficient 6. The second part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), when expanded, has a term where \\(c^0\\), which is 20. So, when you multiply these two, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by 20, giving a total coefficient of 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. In \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying these gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\boxed{120}"

    "text": " Now, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, I think I need to consider how the terms from each part multiply together. Wait, but actually, the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from the terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, maybe the coefficients for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part (\\(6\\)) doesn't get affected by the second part because the second part only involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, perhaps the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just 6 times whatever the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is in the second part, because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by \\(c^0\\), you still get \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, is that right? Let me think again. When you multiply two expressions, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I need to find all the ways that \\(a^2b^2\\) can be multiplied by some term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) such that the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out, i.e., result in \\(c^0\\). Because if the exponents of \\(c\\) don't cancel out, then the term would involve \\(c\\) to some power, and since the original problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I think we're only interested in the terms where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. Otherwise, the term would be something like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) where \\(k \\neq 0\\), and those wouldn't contribute to the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. So, I think I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), and then multiply that by the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6. So, let's work on expanding \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Again, using the binomial theorem, this would be \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying that, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m} = \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, we have terms where the exponent of \\(c\\) is \\(6 - 2m\\), and \\(m\\) ranges from 0 to 6. We need the exponent to be zero, so we set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). So, the term where \\(m = 3\\) will have \\(c^0\\), which is what we want. The coefficient for that term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Let me calculate that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the second part). So, 6 * 20 = 120. Wait, let me double-check that. So, in the first part, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, and in the second part, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Since the terms multiply, the total coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120. That seems right. Alternatively, maybe I can think of it as the entire expression being the product of two polynomials, so the coefficients multiply. So, yes, I think 120 is the correct coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\). I don't think I missed anything here. Wait, let me just make sure I didn't make a mistake in calculating the binomial coefficients. For \\((a + b)^4\\), \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) is indeed 6, because 4 choose 2 is (4*3)/(2*1) = 6. And for \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\) is 20, because 6 choose 3 is (6*5*4)/(3*2*1) = 20. So, 6 * 20 = 120. Yeah, that seems correct.\n\nAnother way to think about it is, since the two parts are independent, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6, and the coefficient for \\(c^0\\) in the second part is 20, so when you multiply the two expressions together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, but only the \\(c^0\\) term will contribute to \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms. So, the total coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nI don't think there's any overlap or other terms that would contribute to \\(a^2b^2\\) without involving \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\). So, I think 120 is the correct coefficient.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Multiplying these gives 6 * 20 = 120.\n\n\\boxed{120}"

So, I think the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression will be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, why \\(c^0\\)? Because when we multiply the two expansions together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), we need to find the term in the second expansion that has \\(c^0\\), which is just a constant. So, that term's coefficient will then multiply the 6 from the first part. Let me confirm that logic. So, the overall expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). If I expand both parts separately, each term in the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, to get a term that only has \\(a^2b^2\\), I need to pick the term from the second expansion that has \\(c^0\\), because if I pick any other term, it would introduce a \\(c\\) term, which we don't want in the term \\(a^2b^2\\).

Now, let me find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Again, I can use the binomial theorem for this.

Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\) which means \\(m = 3\\). So, the term where \\(m = 3\\) will have \\(c^0\\). The coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the second part). So, 6 * 20 = 120. Wait, is that all?

    "text": " Now, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, does that mean that the part involving \\(c\\) doesn't affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)? Hmm, maybe not. Let me think. Because when we multiply two expressions, each term from the first expression gets multiplied by each term from the second expression. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), perhaps the other terms involving \\(c\\) don't matter. Wait, that might not be correct. Because the entire expression is a product of two polynomials, and when we multiply, the variables are separate. So, \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are in the first part, and \\(c\\) is in the second part. So, actually, the terms involving \\(c\\) will multiply the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), but since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), we can consider that term separately. Wait, but no, because when you multiply two terms, each term from the first polynomial will be multiplied by each term from the second polynomial. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by every term from the second part. But since the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), perhaps we can consider that the \\(c\\) terms are separate and that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would just be the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the entire second part, but that doesn't make sense because the second part is also a polynomial in \\(c\\). Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try to clarify. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\). So, perhaps when we multiply the two polynomials together, the only way to get a term that's \\(a^2b^2\\) is if we take the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part and multiply it by the constant term from the second part, which is the term where \\(c\\) cancels out. Because if we take any other term from the second part, like \\(c^6\\) or \\(c^5\\) or \\(1/c\\), those would introduce \\(c\\) terms into the product, which would make the term \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some \\(k\\), but we're only interested in \\(a^2b^2\\), so we need the term where \\(k = 0\\), meaning \\(c^0 = 1\\). So, perhaps the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part. Let me check that logic. So, in the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. Now, in the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\), which is the constant term. Because when we multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by this constant term, we get \\(a^2b^2 \\times\\) (constant), which is the term we're interested in. So, let me find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Again, I can use the binomial theorem for this. The expansion is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the exponent of \\(c\\) in each term is \\(6 - 2m\\). We need the term where the exponent is 0, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\) so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is when \\(m = 3\\), and the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Let me calculate that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the two coefficients: 6 (from the first part) times 20 (from the second part). So, 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient is 120. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake here. So, to recap: The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 20. Therefore, when you multiply the two expressions together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by 20, so the coefficient becomes 6 * 20 = 120. That seems correct. Alternatively, maybe I can think of it as the entire expression being the product of two polynomials, and the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from multiplying the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first polynomial by the constant term in the second polynomial, which is 20. So yes, 6 * 20 = 120. I think that's right. Let me just check if there's another way to approach this. Another way might be to consider that the entire expression is a product of two independent binomial expansions. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would indeed be the product of the coefficients from each expansion that contribute to that term. Since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are in one part and \\(c\\) is in the other, the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is by taking \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part and 1 (the constant term) from the second part. So, yeah, that makes sense. Therefore, the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression is found by considering the binomial expansions of each part. \n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\), so the coefficient is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\n   \\]\n\n2. **Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) to find the constant term:**\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n   \\]\n   The constant term occurs when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which gives \\(m = 3\\).

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again. The problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but the expression is the product of two expansions: one in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and another in \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). Since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), when we multiply the two expansions, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part, because \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by every term in the second expansion. Wait, that might not be right. Alternatively, perhaps the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because each term in the second expansion is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of coefficients in the second expansion. But that seems too broad. Alternatively, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). That is, when you multiply out the entire expression, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by various powers of \\(c\\), but the coefficient would still be 6 times whatever the coefficient is for each term in the second expansion. Wait, no, actually, when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in one polynomial is multiplied by all terms in the other polynomial. So, in this case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6, and when you multiply by the second part, which is a polynomial in \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the entire expansion of the second part, but that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, not a number. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term in the product, but since \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, the coefficient would actually be 6 times the sum of the coefficients of all terms in the second expansion. Wait, that might make sense because if you have \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by each term in the second expansion, the coefficient for each \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) term would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^k\\) in the second expansion. But the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), without specifying a power of \\(c\\), which is confusing. Wait, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). That is, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be present in the product, but multiplied by various powers of \\(c\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. Alternatively, maybe the problem is only considering the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, which would require considering the product of the two expansions, but since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term in the first part, and the second part is a separate polynomial, perhaps the coefficient is just 6 times the entire second expansion, but that doesn't seem right because the coefficient should be a number. Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, the expression is a product of two polynomials, one in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), the other in \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). The term \\(a^2b^2\\) is from the first polynomial, and when multiplied by the second polynomial, each term in the product will be of the form \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2/c^k\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the sum of all coefficients from the second polynomial, because \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But the sum of all coefficients in a polynomial is found by setting all variables to 1. So, if I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = (2)^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 * 64 = 384. Wait, that seems plausible. Let me check that again. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 64. So, when you multiply these two polynomials, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in the second polynomial, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the entire second expansion, but that doesn't make sense because the coefficient should be a scalar. So, I think the correct approach is that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 6 * 64 = 384. Wait, but let me think differently. Maybe the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, considering all possible exponents of \\(c\\). But since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term in the first part, and the second part is a separate polynomial, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually be 6 times the entire second polynomial, but that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which can't be right because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. So, perhaps the problem is misinterpreted, and it's actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some \\(k\\), but since it's not specified, maybe it's just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), which would be 6 times the sum of coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, maybe the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, which would be 6, and the second part is irrelevant because it's a separate variable. But that can't be right because the entire expression is a product, so the coefficients are multiplied. Wait, no, when you have two separate variables, the coefficients are multiplied when you take the product. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) (since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\)) in the second part is the constant term. Wait, that might be the case. So, perhaps I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is the constant term, and then multiply it by 6 to get the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product. That makes more sense because \\(a^2b^2\\) is independent of \\(c\\), so we need the term where the powers of \\(c\\) cancel out, i.e., \\(c^0\\). So, let's calculate the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem again, the expansion is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\). So, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Now, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part. So, that's 6 * 20 = 120. So, the coefficient is 120. Wait, that makes sense because when you multiply the two polynomials, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by the constant term from the second part, which is 20, so 6 * 20 = 120. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 120. I think that's the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Next, we find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which occurs when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. This happens at \\(k = 3\\), giving \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying these results gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{120}\n\\]"

Wait, but the second expansion is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which expands to terms involving various powers of \\(c\\). If I sum all the coefficients, that would be the same as evaluating the expression at \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\(2^6 = 64\\).

Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, considering all possible terms, which would indeed be 384. But let me check that again.\n\nWait, another approach: when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum of the products of the coefficients of terms whose variables multiply to give that specific term. In this case, since the first polynomial is in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the second is in \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), the variables are independent. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product can only come from multiplying \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first polynomial by any term from the second polynomial. Since the second polynomial doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial multiplied by the entire second polynomial. So, that would mean the coefficient is 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would make the coefficient a polynomial, not a constant.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is only considering the product as a polynomial in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), ignoring \\(c\\), which would mean that the coefficient is just 6, but that seems unlikely because the problem includes the second part.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial. Because each term in the second polynomial, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), would contribute to the coefficient. So, to find the total coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), you would sum over all terms in the second polynomial, each multiplied by 6. So, the sum of coefficients in the second polynomial is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me think again. If I have two polynomials, P(a, b) and Q(c), then the product P(a, b) * Q(c) would have terms where each term of P is multiplied by each term of Q. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in P(a, b) multiplied by the entire Q(c), because \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve c. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is indeed 6 * Q(c). But since Q(c) is a polynomial, the coefficient would be a polynomial, not a constant. Therefore, perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient in the product, considering that we're treating c as a variable, so the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of Q(c). But that seems odd because coefficients are usually constants. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product when considered as a polynomial in all variables, but that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in c, which isn't what the problem is asking. The problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, so perhaps I'm overcomplicating it.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, regardless of the c terms. So, that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial.

So, the total coefficient would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, let me confirm this. The sum of the coefficients in the second polynomial \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is found by substituting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is only considering the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without any c terms, meaning that the coefficient is just 6, but that seems unlikely because the problem includes the second part.\n\nWait, another approach: perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, which would mean that we're looking for the term \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by any power of c.

But that doesn't seem right because the entire expression is a product, so each term is multiplied.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me try to see if there's another way. Maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of the c terms, which would mean that we're treating c as a variable independent of a and b. So, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, giving 384.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and the second part is irrelevant because it doesn't affect the a and b terms. But that seems unlikely because the problem includes both parts.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is intended to have the product of the two expressions, and we're to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of c. So, that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of the coefficients of the second polynomial, which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider that when you multiply the two polynomials, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the entire second polynomial. But that would make the coefficient a polynomial in c, which isn't what is asked. So, perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and the second part is just a multiplier. But that seems unclear.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me try to think differently. The problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Since the two polynomials are in different variables, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is simply the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial multiplied by the entire second polynomial. So, that would mean the coefficient is 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that's a polynomial, not a constant. Therefore, perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient in the first polynomial, which is 6, but that seems odd.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is intended to have the product, and we're to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without considering the c terms, meaning that we're to treat the second polynomial as a constant. But that doesn't make sense because the second polynomial is a variable.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product, meaning that we're looking for the term where the exponents of a, b, and c are 2, 2, and 0, respectively. In that case, we would need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product. So, that would involve finding the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part, which is the constant term of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, let's calculate that. The constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is the term where the exponent of c is zero. Using the binomial theorem, the general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(1/c\\right)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We need 6 - 2k = 0, so 2k = 6, so k = 3. Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product is 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient is 120.\n\nWait, that makes sense. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but since the entire expression includes c terms, perhaps it's implicitly asking for the coefficient where the exponents of c cancel out, i.e., \\(c^0\\). So, the coefficient would be 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of c, which would mean that it's 6 times the entire expansion of the second polynomial, but that would make the coefficient a polynomial, which doesn't fit the question.\n\nWait, but the problem is presented as \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", without specifying any c terms, so perhaps it's intended to be 6 times the entire second polynomial, which would make the coefficient a polynomial. But that seems unlikely because the problem is probably expecting a numerical answer.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to have the product, and we're to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, considering all possible c terms. But that would mean that the coefficient is a polynomial, which again doesn't fit the question.\n\nWait, perhaps I misread the problem. Let me check again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, it's only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), without any mention of c. Therefore, perhaps the answer is just 6, because the second part doesn't affect the a and b terms. But that seems too simple, and the problem includes the second part, so maybe I'm missing something.\n\nWait, another thought: perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where a is squared, b is squared, and c is to the zero power. In that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the constant term of the second polynomial, which is 20, so 6 * 20 = 120. That seems plausible.\n\nWait, but the problem didn't specify the c term, so maybe it's just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of c. So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 64, giving 384. Alternatively, if it's asking for the coefficient where c is zero, which isn't possible because c is in the denominator, but that's not the case.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is intended to have the product, and we're to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating c as a variable independent of a and b. So, the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of the second polynomial, which is a polynomial. But since the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, perhaps it's expecting just 6, but that seems inconsistent with the problem's structure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and the second part is irrelevant. But that seems unlikely because the problem includes both parts.\n\nWait, let me think differently. When you have a product of two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term is the sum of the products of the coefficients of terms that multiply to give that specific term. In this case, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) can only come from \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial multiplied by any term in the second polynomial, since the second polynomial doesn't have a or b. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the entire second polynomial. But that would make the coefficient a polynomial in c, which isn't a numerical value. Therefore, perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial, which is 6.\n\nWait, but that seems too simple, and the problem includes both parts. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product when expanded, considering all possible c terms. So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the entire second polynomial, but that would be a polynomial, not a number. Therefore, perhaps the problem is intended to have the product, and we're to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, considering that the c terms are separate, so the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 64, giving 384.\n\nWait, but I'm not entirely sure. Let me try to think of an example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^1 (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, expanding, the coefficient of \\(a^1b^0\\) would be 1 times the entire second polynomial, which is \\(c + 1/c\\). But that's a polynomial, not a number. So, perhaps the problem is intended to have the coefficient as a polynomial, but the problem asks for a numerical coefficient, so that can't be.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating c as a variable, so the coefficient is 6 times the entire second polynomial. But since the problem is asking for the coefficient, which is a number, perhaps the answer is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, that seems plausible. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to have the product, and we're to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be 6 times the constant term of the second polynomial, which is 20, so 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nI think that's more likely. The problem is probably asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, considering that the entire expression is a product, so the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by the constant term of the second polynomial, which is 20, so 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, let me confirm this. The constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is indeed \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nTherefore, I think the answer is 120.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it might be 384, but that was considering the sum of all coefficients, which would be 64, but that would be if we're treating c as 1, which isn't the case. So, perhaps the correct approach is to consider that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the constant term of the second polynomial, which is 20, giving 120.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So, the coefficient is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. To find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, we consider the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20. Multiplying these gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\(\\boxed{120}\\)"

    "text": " But wait, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I need to consider how this multiplication affects the coefficient. Hmm, but actually, since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), maybe we don't need to worry about the \\(c\\) terms because they don't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) exponents. Wait, is that right? Let me think. The expression is a product of two parts: one involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the other involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). When you multiply two expressions together, each term in the first expression is multiplied by each term in the second expression. However, since we're only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), the terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) will just be constants (with respect to \\(a\\) and \\(b\\)) that get multiplied by the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, actually, that's not quite right. Because when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficients multiply if the variables are independent. But in this case, since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are all different variables, the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are independent of the terms involving \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, is that correct? Let me think again. No, actually, that's not correct. Because when you have a product of two expressions, each term in the first expression is multiplied by each term in the second expression. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), we need to consider all the terms in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) and how they multiply with the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. But since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term in \\((a + b)^4\\), when we multiply it by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the resulting term will have \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by some power of \\(c\\). However, the problem is asking only for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). Wait, no, actually, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, which includes all possible terms. But since \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by terms involving \\(c\\), the coefficient would actually be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) contributes a coefficient that multiplies the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. So, to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), we need to take the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, and multiply it by the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Wait, but the second part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The sum of all coefficients in a polynomial is found by setting all variables to 1. So, if I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = (2)^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). Wait, but let me verify this because I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term in \\((a + b)^4\\) and when multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) will contribute a multiple to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the total coefficient would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is indeed 64. So, 6 times 64 is 384. Therefore, the coefficient is 384. Wait, but let me think again. Alternatively, maybe I can consider that the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), and since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are independent variables, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But actually, no, because when you multiply two expressions, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second part, which includes various powers of \\(c\\). However, since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), we need to sum all the coefficients from the second part and multiply by the coefficient from the first part. That is, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the sum of the coefficients in the second part. Since the sum of coefficients in the second part is 64, as calculated before, the total coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384. So, I think that's correct. Alternatively, if the problem had asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some specific \\(k\\), then we would have to find the specific coefficient in the second part corresponding to \\(c^k\\) and multiply it by the coefficient from the first part. But since it's just \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\), we sum all coefficients from the second part. Therefore, the answer is 384. Wait, but let me check another way. Let's compute \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) separately and see how they multiply. \\((a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6. Now, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) can be expanded using the binomial theorem as well. The expansion is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(1/c\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). Now, when we multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which is the sum of \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}\\) for \\(k = 0\\) to \\(6\\). But the sum of binomial coefficients \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} = 2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384. So, yes, that confirms it again. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(2^6 = 64\\). Multiplying these gives \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\boxed{384}."

I need to consider how this part affects the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Hmm, but actually, \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), so when we multiply the two expansions together, the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) will be multiplied by terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), the terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) can be anything because they don't affect the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). So, in other words, when we multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). However, since we're only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), we can consider that this term will be multiplied by every possible term from the second expansion. But wait, no, actually, since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part will be multiplied by every term in the second part, which are all of the form \\(c^k \\times \\dfrac{1}{c}^{6 - k}\\) for \\(k\\) from 0 to 6. But since we're just looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), the coefficient will be the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. Wait, no, that doesn't make sense because each term in the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times each coefficient in the second expansion will contribute to the overall coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, but since the second expansion has variables \\(c\\), the exponents of \\(c\\) don't affect the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). So, the total coefficient will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of the coefficients in the second part. Wait, but that might not be correct. Let me think again. When you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum of the products of the coefficients of terms whose variables multiply to give that specific term. In this case, since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part will be multiplied by every term in the second part, each of which has some power of \\(c\\). However, since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), each multiplication will contribute a term of the form \\(a^2b^2 \\times \\text{something with } c\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Because each term in the second part contributes its own coefficient, and when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), it adds to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. So, to find the total coefficient, I need to compute the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and multiply it by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Now, the sum of all coefficients in a polynomial is found by substituting 1 for all variables. So, for \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), substituting \\(c = 1\\) gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the sum of all coefficients in the second part is 64. So, the total coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). Wait, but let me double-check that logic because sometimes when you have negative terms or more complex expressions, the sum of coefficients might not just be substituting 1. But in this case, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is a polynomial where each term is of the form \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - k} \\times \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, when \\(c = 1\\), each term becomes \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}\\), and the sum is indeed \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} = 2^6 = 64\\). So, that part is correct. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). Hmm, but wait, let me think again. Is that the correct approach? Because when you have two separate variables, \\(a, b\\) and \\(c\\), the exponents are independent. So, when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, each of which has some power of \\(c\\). However, since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), all these multiplied terms will contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. Therefore, the coefficient is indeed the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part. So, that would be \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). Wait, but I'm a bit confused because I thought that when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term is the sum of the products of coefficients of terms that multiply to give that term. But in this case, since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), the terms involving \\(c\\) don't affect the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part will be multiplied by every term in the second part, each contributing their own coefficient, and all these will add up to the total coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. So, yes, that seems correct. Therefore, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). Wait, but let me check with a smaller example to make sure. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^1 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, expanding, it's \\((a + b)(c + 1/c)\\). The coefficient of \\(a^1b^0\\) would be 1 (from \\(a\\)) multiplied by the sum of coefficients in the second part, which is \\(1 + 1 = 2\\), so 1*2=2. But actually, expanding, we get \\(ac + a/c + bc + b/c\\). The coefficient of \\(a\\) is 2 (from \\(ac\\) and \\(a/c\\)), which matches. Similarly, the coefficient of \\(b\\) is 2. So, that seems to work. Similarly, if I take \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^0\\) would be \\(\\dbinom{2}{2}=1\\) times 2, which is 2. Expanding, \\((a^2 + 2ab + b^2)(c + 1/c)\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) is 1*c + 1*(1/c) = c + 1/c, but in terms of coefficients, if we're just looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\), it's 1*1 + 1*1 = 2, which matches. So, that seems to confirm that the approach is correct. Therefore, in the original problem, the coefficient is indeed 6 * 64 = 384. So, I think that's the answer.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 64. Multiplying these gives \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n\\boxed{384}"

Wait, but actually, no. The entire expression is the product of two expansions, so maybe I need to consider how the terms interact. Wait, but the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, perhaps I can treat the two parts separately and then multiply their coefficients. Let me think again. So, \\((a + b)^4\\) gives me a term \\(6a^2b^2\\), as I found earlier. Then, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is another binomial expansion. Let me expand that as well. Using the binomial theorem, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying that, each term becomes \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m} = \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). Now, the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) would be the product of two sums. So, each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which comes from the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) in the first part, we can consider that term multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be \\(6\\) multiplied by the sum of all the terms in the second expansion. Wait, no, that's not right. Because when you multiply two polynomials, each term from the first polynomial is multiplied by each term from the second polynomial. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), the other terms from the second expansion (which involve \\(c\\)) don't affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, that doesn't make sense. Wait, no, actually, when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, each term will have a coefficient, and since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a separate term, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would just be \\(6\\) times the sum of all the coefficients in the second expansion. But that can't be right because the second expansion includes terms with different powers of \\(c\\), which are separate from \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). So, actually, when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, each term will be \\(6a^2b^2 \\times \\text{something with } c\\). But since we're only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, each term in the second expansion will contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. Wait, but that's not quite correct either because each term in the second expansion is a coefficient multiplied by a power of \\(c\\), so when you multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), you get terms like \\(6a^2b^2 \\times \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, each term will have \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by some coefficient and some power of \\(c\\). But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, does that mean we need to sum over all the coefficients in the second expansion because each term will have \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by a different power of \\(c\\)? Wait, that seems confusing. Let me think again.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and the expression is the product of two separate expressions, one involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the other involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), perhaps the \\(c\\) terms don't affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Because when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficients multiply, but the variables remain separate. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire second expression evaluated at the relevant terms. Wait, no, that's not correct because the second expression is a sum of terms involving \\(c\\), which are separate from \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). So, when you multiply \\(6a^2b^2\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be \\(6\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't make sense because the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is a sum of terms involving different powers of \\(c\\), so when you multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), each term will have \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by a coefficient and a power of \\(c\\). But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so perhaps we need to sum over all the coefficients from the second expansion because each term will contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, but that would mean the coefficient is \\(6\\) times the sum of all the coefficients in the second expansion. Let me check that.\n\nWait, the sum of all the coefficients in the second expansion \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\). So, substituting \\(c = 1\\), we get \\((1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). Hmm, but that seems high. Let me think again. Alternatively, maybe I'm making a mistake here. Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, each term will be \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by a coefficient and a power of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would actually be \\(6\\) multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients in the second expansion, because each term in the second expansion contributes a coefficient that multiplies \\(a^2b^2\\). So, if the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion is 64, then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would indeed be \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). But let me check this another way.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider that the entire expression is a product of two independent expansions, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be the product of the coefficient from the first part and the sum of all coefficients from the second part. Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, each term contributes a coefficient, so the total coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) would be \\(6 \\times\\) (sum of coefficients in the second expansion). Since the sum of coefficients in the second expansion is \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\), then yes, the coefficient would be \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). Hmm, that seems correct.\n\nWait, but let me think differently. Suppose I don't separate the two parts and instead consider the entire product. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the first part, and the second part can contribute any term, but since we're only interested in \\(a^2b^2\\), the other variables \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) can be anything, so their coefficients just add up. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed \\(6\\) times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, giving 384.\n\nWait, but another approach: the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the same as the coefficient in the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the entire second part, because each term in the second part is a coefficient times a power of \\(c\\). So, when you multiply \\(6a^2b^2\\) by the entire second expansion, you get \\(6a^2b^2 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which means the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(6 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But since the problem is just asking for the coefficient, not the entire expression, I think we need to consider that the coefficient is \\(6\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, giving 384.\n\nWait, but maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me try another approach. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by every possible term from the second expansion. So, each of these terms will have a coefficient, and each will contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(6\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, so 6 \u00d7 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should think of the entire product as a product of two polynomials, and when you multiply them, the coefficient of a specific term in one polynomial is multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the other polynomial. So, yes, that makes sense. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 \u00d7 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me confirm this with an example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^1 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, \\((a + b)(c + 1/c)\\). The coefficient of \\(a^1b^0\\) is 1 (from \\(a\\)) multiplied by the sum of coefficients in the second part, which is \\(1 + 1 = 2\\), so 1 \u00d7 2 = 2. So, the coefficient of \\(a\\) would be 2. Similarly, the coefficient of \\(b\\) would also be 2. Let me check: expanding \\((a + b)(c + 1/c)\\), we get \\(a c + a/c + b c + b/c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a\\) is \\(c + 1/c\\), but if we're considering the coefficient as a numerical factor, regardless of \\(c\\), then it's indeed 2 for each \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). So, that seems to confirm that the approach is correct.\n\nTherefore, applying this to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\nWait, but let me just make sure I didn't make any calculation errors. So, \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\), that's correct. Then, the sum of coefficients in the second expansion is \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\), that's correct. So, 6 \u00d7 64 = 384. That seems right.\n\nWait, but another way to think about it: the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). The term \\(a^2b^2\\) is present only in \\((a + b)^4\\), and when multiplied by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in the second expansion will multiply \\(a^2b^2\\), so the coefficient becomes \\(6\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is indeed 64. So, 6 \u00d7 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me check with a specific term. For example, in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the constant term is when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. Let me calculate that. The general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, setting \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), we get \\(m = 3\\). So, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. So, when I multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by this term, I get \\(20a^2b^2\\). Similarly, other terms in the second expansion will have coefficients multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\) times different powers of \\(c\\). But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\), I think we have to consider all these contributions. Wait, but that would mean the coefficient is \\(6 \\times\\) sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, as before. But if I only take the constant term, it's 20, then the coefficient would be \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\), which is different. So, which is correct?\n\nWait, this is where I might have made a mistake earlier. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but in the entire product, \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by various powers of \\(c\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) can appear with different coefficients depending on the power of \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, perhaps we need to sum over all possible coefficients that multiply \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) power. So, that would mean the coefficient is \\(6\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, giving 384.\n\nBut wait, let's think about this differently. Suppose I have two polynomials, P(a, b) and Q(c). The product P(a, b) \u00d7 Q(c) will have terms where each term of P is multiplied by each term of Q. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in P(a, b) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in Q(c). Because each term in Q(c) is a coefficient times some power of c, so when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), each term contributes to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is indeed the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in P(a, b) and the sum of all coefficients in Q(c).\n\nIn our case, P(a, b) is \\((a + b)^4\\), and the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. Q(c) is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), and the sum of its coefficients is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 \u00d7 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought about the constant term being 20, which would give a different coefficient. But that's only considering the term where c^0 is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). But the problem doesn't specify any condition on c, so it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of c. So, that would mean that every term in Q(c) contributes to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, because each term is a coefficient times some power of c, and when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), it becomes a term like coefficient \u00d7 \\(a^2b^2c^{k}\\). But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), without any restriction on c, perhaps we need to sum all the coefficients from Q(c) and multiply by the coefficient from P(a, b).\n\nWait, but that doesn't seem right because each term in Q(c) is a separate term. So, actually, the product will have terms like \\(6a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(6a^2b^2c^4\\), etc., each with their own coefficients. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would include all terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present, regardless of the power of c. So, in that case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the sum of all the coefficients from Q(c) multiplied by 6. Because each term in Q(c) is a coefficient that, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), contributes to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. Therefore, the total coefficient is 6 \u00d7 (sum of coefficients in Q(c)) = 6 \u00d7 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me think about this again. Suppose I have two variables, a and b, and another variable c. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). If I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of c, then every term in the expansion where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present, multiplied by any power of c, will contribute to the coefficient. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the sum over all coefficients from Q(c) multiplied by 6. Because each term in Q(c) is a coefficient, and when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), it becomes a term with \\(a^2b^2\\) and some power of c, each contributing to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when considering all possible c terms. Therefore, the total coefficient is indeed 6 \u00d7 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me check this with a smaller example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^1 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, the expansion is \\(a c + a/c + b c + b/c\\). The coefficient of \\(a\\) is \\(c + 1/c\\), and the coefficient of \\(b\\) is also \\(c + 1/c\\). But if I'm asked for the coefficient of \\(a\\), regardless of c, I would sum the coefficients of the terms involving \\(a\\), which are \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), so the coefficient is \\(1 + 1 = 2\\). Similarly, the coefficient of \\(b\\) is also 2. So, in this case, the coefficient of \\(a\\) is 2, which is 1 (coefficient from \\((a + b)^1\\)) multiplied by the sum of coefficients in \\((c + 1/c)^1\\), which is 2. So, that matches the approach.\n\nSimilarly, in our problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 (from \\((a + b)^4\\)) multiplied by the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 64, giving 384. So, that seems correct.\n\nWait, but another way to think about it: the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), because each term in the second expansion contributes a coefficient that multiplies \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\nWait, but let me just make sure I'm not confusing the concept of coefficients. In the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term is a product of a term from the first expansion and a term from the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, each of which has a coefficient and a power of c. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the coefficient from the first expansion (\\(6\\)) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion. Because each term in the second expansion contributes its coefficient to the term \\(a^2b^2\\) when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). So, yes, that makes sense.\n\nSo, to recap:\n\n1. Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is 6.\n2. Expand \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) and find the sum of all its coefficients by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\(2^6 = 64\\).\n3. Multiply these two results: \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is 384.\n\nWait, but I just thought of something else. What if the problem had been asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\)? Then, the coefficient would be different. In that case, we would need to find the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by the constant term in the second expansion. As I calculated earlier, the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) would be \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). But in our problem, it's just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), without any restriction on c. So, that means we have to consider all possible terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present, regardless of the power of c. Therefore, the coefficient is indeed 384.\n\nWait, but let me check once more. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). And \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15c^{-2} + 6c^{-4} + c^{-6}\\). Now, when I multiply these two, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, giving \\(6a^2b^2c^6 + 36a^2b^2c^4 + 90a^2b^2c^2 + 120a^2b^2 + 90a^2b^2c^{-2} + 36a^2b^2c^{-4} + 6a^2b^2c^{-6}\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the sum of all the coefficients in front of \\(a^2b^2\\), which are 6, 36, 90, 120, 90, 36, and 6. Adding these up: 6 + 36 = 42; 42 + 90 = 132; 132 + 120 = 252; 252 + 90 = 342; 342 + 36 = 378; 378 + 6 = 384. So, that confirms it. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 384.\n\nSo, after going through this step-by-step and verifying with an example, I'm confident that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 384.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{384}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem for both parts of the expression.\n\n1. **Expanding \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\binom{4}{k} a^{4 - k} b^k\n   \\]\n   The term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\), so the coefficient is:\n   \\[\n   \\binom{4}{2} = \\frac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\n   \\]\n\n2. **Expanding \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\binom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\binom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n   \\]\n   The sum of all coefficients in this expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\):\n   \\[\n   (1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\n   \\]\n\n3. **Combining the results:**\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) and the sum of all coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 64 = 384\n   \\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{384}\\)."

    "text": " But wait, the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I need to consider that as well. But hold on, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are only in the first part of the product, \\((a + b)^4\\), the \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) part doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. It only affects the \\(c\\) terms. So, does that mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just 6 times whatever comes from the other part? Wait, no, because when you multiply two expressions, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression. But since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are only in the first expression, and \\(c\\) is only in the second, the cross terms won't affect each other. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, no, actually, when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficients multiply only if the variables are the same. Since in this case, \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are different variables from \\(c\\), the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) won't combine with terms involving \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will just be the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that doesn't make sense because the coefficient should be a single number, not a polynomial. Hmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, perhaps the question is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, in other words, when you multiply out the entire expression, you'll have terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for various \\(k\\), and the coefficient for each such term would be 6 times the coefficient from the second part. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which might imply considering all possible powers of \\(c\\), but that's not standard. Typically, when asked for the coefficient of a term with specific variables, it's assumed that other variables can have any exponent, but in this case, since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), perhaps the coefficient is just 6, because the other part doesn't affect \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). But I'm not sure. Wait, let me think again. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). When you expand this, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, for example, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), etc. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^6\\) would be 6, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^4\\) would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^4\\) in the second expansion, and so on. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Since \\(a^2b^2\\) can be multiplied by any power of \\(c\\), I think the problem is asking for the sum of all coefficients where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, that would mean we need to compute 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But wait, the sum of all coefficients in a polynomial is found by setting all variables to 1. So, if we set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = (1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the sum of all coefficients in the second part is 64. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times 64, which is 384. Wait, but is that correct? Let me check. If I have \\((a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\), and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15/c^2 + 6/c^4 + 1/c^6\\). When I multiply these together, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first will be multiplied by each term in the second, giving \\(a^2b^2c^6 + 6a^2b^2c^4 + 15a^2b^2c^2 + 20a^2b^2 + 15a^2b^2/c^2 + 6a^2b^2/c^4 + a^2b^2/c^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) across all terms (i.e., considering all powers of \\(c\\)) is indeed 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6*64=384. But wait, is that what the problem is asking? It says, \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\". Usually, in such problems, unless specified, the coefficient refers to the coefficient when considering all variables, but in this case, since \\(c\\) is another variable, perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. But that's a bit ambiguous. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting just the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, because the second part doesn't affect \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). But that seems unlikely because the entire expression is a product. Let me think again. If I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then it would be 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part, which would give multiple terms with \\(a^2b^2\\) and different powers of \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so perhaps it's expecting the sum of all coefficients where \\(a^2b^2\\) appears, which would be 6 times the sum of coefficients in the second part, which is 6*64=384. Alternatively, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, meaning the term that has exactly \\(a^2b^2\\) and no other variables, but that's impossible because the second part introduces \\(c\\) terms. So, perhaps the problem is considering \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), so the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of coefficients in the second part, which is 384. Alternatively, maybe the problem is expecting just the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, but that seems too simple. Let me check an example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1)^1\\). Then, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^0\\) would be 1 times the sum of coefficients in the second part, which is 2, so 2. But if the problem had asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^0c^1\\), that would be 1*1=1. So, in this problem, since it's asking for \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that can be multiplied by any power of \\(c\\), the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of coefficients in the second part, which is 6*64=384. Alternatively, if the problem had asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for a specific \\(k\\), then it would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^k\\) in the second part. But since it's just \\(a^2b^2\\), I think it's safe to assume that it's asking for the sum of all coefficients where \\(a^2b^2\\) appears, regardless of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient is 6*64=384. Wait, but let me make sure. Another way to think about it is that when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a term like \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the product of the coefficients of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial and the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial. Because each term in the second polynomial is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), so the total coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) across all terms would be 6*(sum of coefficients in second polynomial). So, yes, 6*64=384. Therefore, the coefficient is 384. But wait, let me double-check the sum of coefficients in the second polynomial. \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) when \\(c=1\\) is \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, yes, the sum is 64. Therefore, 6*64=384. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplying it by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 64 when \\(c = 1\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n\\boxed{384}"

But wait, the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\). So, does that mean I don't need to worry about the \\(c\\) terms? Hmm, maybe I should check that. Wait, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when I multiply these two expansions together, each term from \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\).

But since the question is only about the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), perhaps the \\(c\\) part can be anything because it's not specified. Wait, no, that doesn't make sense. Maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, I think that means I need to consider all possible terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that can't be right because the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, does that mean the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times 64, which is 384? But that seems too straightforward. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think again. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in the product, each term from \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by every term from the second part. Therefore, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be \\(6\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Since the sum of coefficients is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\(2^6 = 64\\), the total coefficient would be \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). But wait, let me check if that's correct. Alternatively, maybe I'm supposed to consider that the \\(c\\) terms could affect the coefficient, but since the problem only asks for \\(a^2b^2\\), it's independent of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient would indeed be \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). Alternatively, maybe I'm making a mistake here. Let me approach it differently. Let's consider the entire expression as a product of two independent expansions. So, when you multiply them, the coefficients multiply. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) (since \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) can cancel out) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is the central term, which is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Wait, so if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), then it would be \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). But the problem didn't specify any condition on \\(c\\), so maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me read the problem again carefully. It says, \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\).\" So, it's just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in that case, every term from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) would contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), because \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part. The sum of coefficients in the second part is when \\(c = 1\\), so \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the total coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384. But wait, that seems high. Alternatively, maybe the problem wants the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), which would be 6 * 20 = 120. But since the problem doesn't specify \\(c^0\\), I'm confused. Let me think again. When you have a product of two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in one variable is the sum of the products of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each polynomial. So, in this case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the sum of all coefficients in the second part because \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by every term in the second expansion. So, yes, that would be 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, if the problem had asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some specific \\(k\\), then it would be different. But since it's only \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\), the coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384. Wait, but I'm not sure if that's correct because I might be missing something. Let me check with a smaller example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). So, \\((a + b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2\\), and \\((c + 1/c)^1 = c + 1/c\\). So, the product is \\(a^2c + a^2/c + 2abc + 2ab/c + b^2c + b^2/c\\). Now, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^0\\) would be the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) times the sum of coefficients in the second part. The coefficient of \\(a^2\\) is 1, and the sum of coefficients in the second part is 2 (since \\(c + 1/c\\) evaluated at \\(c=1\\) is 2). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) in the product would be 1*2=2. Indeed, looking at the product, the terms with \\(a^2\\) are \\(a^2c\\) and \\(a^2/c\\), each with coefficient 1, so total coefficient is 2, which matches 1*2. Similarly, the coefficient of \\(ab\\) would be 2 times 2=4, because the coefficient of \\(ab\\) in the first part is 2, and the sum in the second part is 2. So, in the product, the terms with \\(ab\\) are \\(2abc\\) and \\(2ab/c\\), each with coefficient 2, so total coefficient is 4, which is correct. So, applying this logic to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the sum of coefficients in the second part, which is 6*64=384. Therefore, the answer should be 384. But wait, in my small example, the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) was 1, and when multiplied by the sum of coefficients in the second part, it gave the correct total coefficient. So, yes, this approach seems valid. Therefore, I think the coefficient is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). The sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), giving \\(2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n\\boxed{384}"

So, perhaps the answer is just 6, because the other part doesn't affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Alternatively, maybe the question is more complex. Let me think again. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). When you expand this, each term from \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, for example, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part would be multiplied by each term from the second part, which could have various powers of \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so that would include all the terms from the second expansion multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part, but that doesn't make sense because the expansion of the second part is a sum of terms with different powers of \\(c\\). Wait, no, actually, when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), you're effectively distributing \\(a^2b^2\\) across all those terms. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would actually be \\(6 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that seems odd because it's not a numerical coefficient anymore; it's a polynomial in \\(c\\). Wait, but the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would then be \\(6 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that can't be right because the question is likely expecting a numerical coefficient. So, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, considering all possible terms, but that would require more steps. Wait, maybe the problem is intended to have \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by some term from the second expansion, but since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), perhaps the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is simply the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, regardless of the second part. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is more about considering the entire product and looking for the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by a specific term in the second expansion, but since the problem doesn't specify any conditions on \\(c\\), I think the answer is just 6. Wait, but let me check again. Let me consider that when you have two independent variables, \\(a, b\\) and \\(c\\), the terms in the product are combinations of terms from each expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first expansion and is multiplied by every term from the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient from the first part, 6, multiplied by the entire second expansion. But that would mean the coefficient is \\(6 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial, not a single number. But the problem is asking for the coefficient, which should be a number. Therefore, perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and the rest is a red herring. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me try to think differently. Maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire expression. Because if we consider the entire product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by terms from the second expansion, which could have different powers of \\(c\\). So, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), that would make sense. So, perhaps I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\) in the product. That would mean I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), then multiply them together. Let me check that approach. So, first, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\), as I calculated before. Now, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is the middle term when expanded, which occurs when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. So, using the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\times (1/c)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We want the exponent of \\(c\\) to be zero, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which implies \\(k = 3\\). So, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Now, since the two expansions are multiplied together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire product is the product of the coefficients from each part, which is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) (assuming the problem meant \\(a^2b^2c^0\\)) is 120. Wait, but the original problem didn't specify \\(c^0\\); it just said \\(a^2b^2\\). So, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it by considering \\(c^0\\). Alternatively, maybe the problem is intended to consider that \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any term from the second expansion, so the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but that would result in a polynomial, not a single number. Therefore, I think the problem must be asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to have \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, so the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion. The sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, 6 times 64 would be 384. But that seems too high, and I think the problem is more likely asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. Let me double-check. The problem says: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\).\" Since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by each term from the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient from the first part, 6, multiplied by the entire second expansion. But that would mean the coefficient is \\(6 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial, not a number. Therefore, perhaps the problem is intended to ask for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and the rest is extraneous. Alternatively, maybe the problem is a typo, and it's supposed to be \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). Given that, I think the intended answer is 120, considering the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). So, to recap: The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Therefore, the answer is 120.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can proceed as follows:\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\), so its coefficient is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\n   \\]\n\n2. **Consider the second part \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   We need the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) (the constant term) in this expansion.

Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but is that the case? Or does each term in the product contribute to different terms, so perhaps the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) because \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\). Wait, that might not make sense because when you multiply, each term from the first polynomial is multiplied by each term from the second polynomial. But since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), it will be multiplied by every term in the second expansion, so the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) times each term in the second expansion. But wait, no, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is a single term, and when you multiply it by the entire second expansion, it will create multiple terms involving \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by various powers of \\(c\\). But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because each term in the second expansion is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, that seems a bit off. Let me try to clarify. When you have two polynomials multiplied together, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum of the products of the coefficients of terms whose variables multiply to give that specific term. So, in this case, we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\). So, in the product, any term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) that doesn't involve \\(c\\) (i.e., the constant term) when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\) will contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). However, terms involving \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\) when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\) will result in terms like \\(a^2b^2c\\) or \\(a^2b^2/c\\), which are different from \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the only contribution to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product comes from the term where the second polynomial \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) contributes a constant term (i.e., \\(c^0\\)) when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is equal to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Therefore, I need to compute two things: 1. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which I already found to be 6. 2. The coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me focus on the second part now. The expression is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Again, I can use the binomial theorem to expand this. The general term in the expansion is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k - k} = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so we set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(6 = 2k\\) \u2192 \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Now, going back to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the product of the two coefficients I found: 6 (from \\((a + b)^4\\)) and 20 (from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)). So, 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120. Wait, let me double-check that. So, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. In \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. So, when I multiply these two, 6 * 20 = 120. That seems correct. So, I think the answer is 120. Yeah, that makes sense. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning. I considered the binomial expansions correctly, found the necessary coefficients, and multiplied them together. So, I think the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is found using the binomial coefficient \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). In the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the constant term (coefficient of \\(c^0\\)) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying these coefficients gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\boxed{120}."

Wait, but the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, does that mean I don't need to worry about the \\(c\\) terms? Hmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Let me think again. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, when we multiply these two expansions together, each term from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term from the second expansion. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that comes only from the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), the second part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), will contribute some factor, but since we're not concerned with the powers of \\(c\\), we just need to multiply the coefficient from the first part by the entire expansion of the second part, right? Wait, no, that can't be right because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by any \\(c\\) terms. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would just be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But wait, that doesn't make sense because the entire expression would have terms like \\(a^2b^2 \\times c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2 \\times c^{-k}\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But wait, that's not correct either because the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, maybe the coefficient is just 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Hmm, but that seems a bit off. Let me think again. Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of what happens with \\(c\\), then the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, perhaps the problem is considering the entire expression as a polynomial in \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\), and \\(1/c\\), and it's asking for the coefficient of the term \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, in other words, when you multiply out the entire expression, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by various powers of \\(c\\), but the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the sum of all the coefficients from each of those terms. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But wait, the sum of the coefficients in a polynomial is found by setting all variables to 1. So, if I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = (1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 times 64, which is 384. Wait, but let me verify this. Alternatively, maybe I'm supposed to consider that each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) contributes to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when multiplied by the corresponding term from \\((a + b)^4\\). So, since the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) for \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, and then when multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which has terms like \\(c^6\\), \\(6c^4\\), \\(15c^2\\), \\(20\\), \\(15c^{-2}\\), \\(6c^{-4}\\), \\(c^{-6}\\), each of these would be multiplied by 6, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually be 6 times each of these terms, but since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), it's just 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 times 64, so 384. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating and the answer is simply 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 times 64, which is 384. Let me check this again. Alternatively, perhaps I should think of it as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, and the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but that would make the coefficient a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. So, perhaps the problem is only considering the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms, meaning that we're supposed to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. Wait, but that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 times 64, which is 384. Alternatively, maybe the problem is considering that the coefficient is just 6, and the rest is part of the expression, but that doesn't seem right. Let me think again. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, which doesn't make sense. So, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Maybe I should consider that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, and since the other part is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is a separate expansion, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would just be 6 multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. Therefore, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times any power of \\(c\\), so the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 times 64, so 384.

Hmm, I'm a bit confused here. Let me try a different approach. Let's consider the entire expression: \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). When we expand this, each term in the expansion will be of the form \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}a^{4 - k}b^k \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - m} \\times (1/c)^m\\), which simplifies to \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}\\dbinom{6}{m}a^{4 - k}b^k c^{6 - 2m}\\). Now, we are interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, we set \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). That gives us the coefficient from the first part as \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Now, for each \\(m\\) in the second part, the term will contribute \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\) times \\(c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product will be the sum over all \\(m\\) of \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\dbinom{6}{m}\\). So, that would be \\(6 \\times \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m}\\). But \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). Wait, that makes sense. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 64, so 6 times 64 is 384. Therefore, the answer should be 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression is found by first determining the coefficient in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplying it by the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is \\(2^6 = 64\\). Thus, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{384}\n\\]"

Wait, but no, that's not quite right. Let me think again. The entire expression is a product of two separate expressions: one involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the other involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, when I multiply them together, each term from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term from the second expansion. But since the variables are different, the coefficients will multiply, but the variables will just be combined. However, the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). That means we can ignore the terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), because the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is independent of the \\(c\\) terms. Wait, but that doesn't sound quite right.

Wait, no, that's not correct because when you multiply two expressions, the coefficient of a specific term in one part is multiplied by the entire other expression. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).

But that seems complicated.

Hmm, I'm confused now. Let me try to think differently. Maybe the problem is just to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then since the other part is multiplied by it, perhaps the coefficient remains 6. But that seems too simple. Alternatively, maybe the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), and we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) would be when \\(c = 1\\), so substituting \\(c = 1\\), we get \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of coefficients is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 \u00d7 64 = 384. But I'm not sure if that's correct because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not the sum of coefficients. Alternatively, maybe the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just 6, and the other part doesn't affect it because it's multiplied by terms involving \\(c\\). But that doesn't make sense because when you multiply, each term from the first part is multiplied by each term from the second part. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part would be multiplied by each term from the second part, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2c^{-k}\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would then be a polynomial in \\(c\\), not a single number. So, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion of the entire expression, treating all variables as separate, so the coefficient would be a combination of terms involving \\(c\\). But that seems more complicated, and the problem might be expecting a numerical answer. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is just to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then the other part is just a separate factor. So, maybe the answer is 6. But I'm not sure. Let me try to think again. Let's consider the entire expression: \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). If I expand this, I'll have terms like \\(a^kb^{4 - k}\\) multiplied by terms like \\(c^mc^{6 - m}\\) or something like that. Wait, actually, in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term is of the form \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - m}\\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, each term in the second expansion is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\) for \\(m\\) from 0 to 6. So, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term \\(a^kb^{4 - k}\\) from the first expansion is multiplied by each term \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\) from the second expansion. Therefore, the entire expansion will have terms of the form \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}\\dbinom{6}{m}a^kb^{4 - k}c^{6 - 2m}\\). Now, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, we need \\(k = 2\\) because \\(a^2b^2\\) implies \\(k = 2\\) and \\(4 - k = 2\\). So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) multiplied by the sum over all \\(m\\) of \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\). Wait, no, because each term is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\dbinom{6}{m}a^2b^2c^{6 - 2m}\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, that would mean the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) times the sum of all \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\) for \\(m\\) from 0 to 6. But the sum of \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\) from \\(m = 0\\) to \\(6\\) is \\(2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} \\times 64 = 6 \\times 64 = 384\\). But wait, that seems too large, and I'm not sure if that's correct. Alternatively, maybe I'm supposed to consider that the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, so the coefficient would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) times the sum of \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\) for all \\(m\\), which is indeed 64, so 6 \u00d7 64 = 384. But I'm not sure if that's what the problem is asking for. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and the second part is just a separate factor, so the coefficient remains 6. But that doesn't seem right because the entire expression is a product. Let me try to clarify. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient, and not the variable part, perhaps the coefficient is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion. The sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is obtained by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 \u00d7 64 = 384. But I'm not entirely sure if this is the correct interpretation. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, considering all variables, so the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by each term in the second expansion, but that would result in a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't seem to be the case. The problem is probably expecting a numerical coefficient, so I think the correct approach is to compute the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and then multiply it by the sum of the coefficients in the second part, which is 64, giving 384. So, I think the answer is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). The entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), whose sum of coefficients is \\(2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n\\boxed{384}"

    "text": " Now, the expression also has \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I think I need to expand this as well, but I'm not sure yet. Wait, the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, does that mean I don't need to consider the \\(c\\) terms? Or does it mean that I have to multiply the coefficients from both expansions? Hmm, maybe I should think about it more carefully. Wait, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), that term would come from the product where the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first part is multiplied by any term in the second part. But since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), I think the coefficient would just be the coefficient from the first part, multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part, but since we're only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), maybe the second part doesn't affect it? Wait, no, that can't be right because the entire expression is a product of two polynomials. So, perhaps when we multiply, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term would be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, and each of those would contribute to the coefficient. But wait, the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so maybe it's only considering the terms where the \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by the constant term in the second expansion? Or maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think again. The expression is \\((a + b)^4\\) times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when we expand both, each term in the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second part, which is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, that would mean that any term that has \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by any term from the second expansion would contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the overall expression. But wait, no, because the overall expression is a product, so each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, if I have \\(a^2b^2\\) times some term involving \\(c\\), that would create a term like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2c^{-k}\\), etc. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). Wait, that might not make sense because in the product, each term would have both \\(a\\) and \\(c\\) parts. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the sum of all the coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by the coefficient from the first expansion. Wait, no, that's not quite right. Let me clarify: When you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is obtained by multiplying the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each polynomial. But in this case, the first polynomial is in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the second is in \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, when you multiply them, the variables are separate. Therefore, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is multiplied by every term in the second part. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second polynomial, the \\(a^2b^2\\) part remains, and the coefficients from each term in the second polynomial add up. So, the coefficient would be the coefficient from the first part times the sum of the coefficients in the second part. Let me check that. Let's denote the first polynomial as \\(P(a, b) = (a + b)^4\\) and the second as \\(Q(c) = \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Then the product is \\(P(a, b) \\times Q(c)\\). So, when we look for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), it's the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(P(a, b)\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(Q(c)\\), because each term in \\(Q(c)\\) is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), contributing to the overall coefficient. So, the sum of the coefficients in \\(Q(c)\\) is obtained by setting \\(c = 1\\), because that makes each term equal to its coefficient. So, \\(Q(1) = \\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = (2)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). Wait, but let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. Alternatively, maybe I should think of it as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and then since the second part is multiplied by all terms, including constants, so the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which is 64. So, 6 * 64 = 384. That seems right. Alternatively, perhaps I can think of the entire expression as a product, and when looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), it's the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and the constant term in the second part. But wait, no, because the second part isn't just a constant; it's a polynomial in \\(c\\). So, when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second polynomial, each term contributes to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times that term's coefficient. So, the total coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial. So, that's 6 times 64, which is 384. Alternatively, maybe I should calculate the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) and find the sum of its coefficients. Let's do that. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, the coefficients are \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}\\) for each term. The sum of the coefficients is when \\(c = 1\\), so as I did before, it's \\(2^6 = 64\\). So, yes, the sum of coefficients is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 * 64 = 384. So, I think that's the answer. But let me check again to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. So, first, I found the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. Then, I found the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives 64. Multiplying these together gives 6 * 64 = 384. That seems correct. Alternatively, maybe I should think of it as each term in the product contributing to the coefficient. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part, so each term in the second part adds its coefficient to the overall coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the total coefficient is 6 times the sum of coefficients in the second part, which is 6 * 64 = 384. Yeah, that makes sense. So, I think the answer is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) can be found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplying it by the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 64. Thus, the final coefficient is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n\\boxed{384}"
