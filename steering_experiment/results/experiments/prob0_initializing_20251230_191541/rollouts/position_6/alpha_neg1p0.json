    "text": " The expansion would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{0}a^4b^0 + \\dbinom{4}{1}a^3b^1 + \\dbinom{4}{2}a^2b^2 + \\dbinom{4}{3}a^1b^3 + \\dbinom{4}{4}a^0b^4\\). Calculating the coefficients, that would be \\(1 \\cdot a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + 1b^4\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in this part is 6. But wait, the original problem is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I think I need to consider both parts. Maybe the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just 6 multiplied by something from the second part? Hmm, but actually, when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficients multiply. So, if I have \\( (a + b)^4 \\) and \\( \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 \\), and I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is in the first part, then since \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) are separate variables, they don't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. So, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term's coefficient would just be 6 times whatever the constant term is in the second part, because when you multiply, the exponents of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) would have to cancel out to give a constant term. Otherwise, the product would have terms involving \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), which wouldn't be part of the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. So, I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let's expand that using the binomial theorem as well. The expansion would be \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k\\). Simplifying each term, that's \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, we're looking for the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, because that's the constant term. So, set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20. Now, going back to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the constant term from the second part, which is 20. So, 6 times 20 is 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120. Wait, let me double-check that. So, in the first part, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6. In the second part, the constant term is 20. Since we're multiplying the two expressions, each term in the first part gets multiplied by each term in the second part. So, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first part will be multiplied by the constant term in the second part, which is 20. So, yes, 6 times 20 is 120. I think that makes sense. There's no other way for the \\(a^2b^2\\) term to come into play because the second part only affects the \\(c\\) terms, not the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. So, I don't think I've missed anything here. Therefore, I'm confident that the coefficient is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplying it by the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20. Therefore, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\boxed{120}"

But wait, the original expression isn't just \\((a + b)^4\\), it's multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Hmm, so I guess I need to consider how that multiplication affects the coefficient. \n\nWait, but the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is only from the first part, right? Because the second part is in terms of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), which don't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\). So, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nBut since I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I can just take the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part, which is 6, and then multiply it by the entire expansion of the second part because the second part doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\). \n\nWait, but that doesn't make sense because the second part is being multiplied, so each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second. But since I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term without \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), does that mean I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) and then multiply it by 6?\n\nWait, no. Because if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), that term itself is from the first part, and when multiplied by the second part, it will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But since the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I think it's assuming that the entire expression is expanded, and we're looking for the term where the variables are \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by whatever comes from the \\(c\\) terms. But actually, no, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. Wait, but that can't be because the entire expression is a product of two polynomials. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in the second polynomial, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in the second polynomial. But that doesn't make sense because each term in the second polynomial is a different power of \\(c\\), so when you multiply, each term would have a different power of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually be 6 times the entire expansion of the second polynomial, which isn't correct because the problem is asking for a specific coefficient, not an expression.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" Hmm, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. But that doesn't make sense because each term in the product would have both \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms multiplied by \\(c\\) terms. So, perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and the second part doesn't affect it because it's multiplied by other terms. Wait, but that can't be right because the entire expression is a product, so each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 multiplied by each term in the second expansion, but that would give a sum of terms, not a single coefficient.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, that is, the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that seems odd because it would result in a polynomial in \\(c\\), and the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem just asks for a coefficient, so maybe it's just 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 times \\(2^6 = 64\\), so 6 * 64 = 384. Wait, but that might not be correct because the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion is when \\(c = 1\\), so \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\), so yes, the sum of the coefficients is 64. So, 6 * 64 = 384. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 384. But I'm not sure if that's correct because the problem might be asking for the coefficient in the entire product, but if we're considering the product as a polynomial in \\(a, b, c\\), then the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would have a coefficient that is a polynomial in \\(c\\), but the problem just asks for the coefficient, so maybe it's considering the coefficient as a polynomial, but I think more likely, it's just 6 times the constant term of the second expansion, which is when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero.\n\nWait, let me think again. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first part, which is multiplied by each term in the second part. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. But wait, that's if we're considering all the terms, but maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which would mean that it's 6 times the entire expansion, but that doesn't make sense because the coefficient would then be a polynomial in \\(c\\). Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient when considering the entire product as a single polynomial, but the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would have a coefficient that is the sum of all the products of the coefficients from the first expansion and the second expansion. Wait, no, because the second expansion is in \\(c\\), so when you multiply, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would actually be 6 times the entire expansion of the second part, which is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which seems odd because the problem just asks for a coefficient, implying a numerical value.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, so the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem doesn't specify, so maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and the second part is just a constant multiplier, but that doesn't make sense because the second part is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which isn't a constant.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me try to think differently. Perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, but considering that the product is \\((a + b)^4\\) times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which would be a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem asks for a coefficient, which is usually a number, so maybe I'm missing something.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating \\(c\\) as a variable, so the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem doesn't specify, so maybe it's just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and the second part is irrelevant. But that seems unlikely because the problem includes both parts.\n\nWait, maybe I should consider that the entire expression is a product, and when you expand it, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term from the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. But that would be the case if we're considering the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, for example, if we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), that would be 6 times the constant term in the second expansion.\n\nWait, let me calculate the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). The general term in the expansion is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - k}(1/c)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, the exponent of \\(c\\) is \\(6 - 2k\\). To find the constant term, set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire product would be 6 * 20 = 120. But the problem just asks for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), without specifying \\(c\\), so maybe it's considering all possible powers of \\(c\\), which would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but that doesn't make sense because the coefficient would then be a polynomial in \\(c\\).\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, which would involve considering the product of the two expansions. But since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6*(c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15/c^2 + 6/c^4 + 1/c^6). So, the coefficient would be 6*(c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15/c^2 + 6/c^4 + 1/c^6). But that seems too complicated, and the problem likely expects a numerical coefficient, so maybe I'm overcomplicating it.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, so the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which is not a single number. Therefore, maybe the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and the second part is irrelevant. But that seems unlikely because the problem includes both parts.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider that the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, but since the product is a polynomial in multiple variables, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) multiplied by 6. So, the coefficient is 6*(c + 1/c)^6. But that seems too involved, and the problem likely expects a numerical answer, so perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, ignoring the \\(c\\) terms, meaning that we're considering the product as a polynomial in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which would be a polynomial in \\(c\\). But again, that doesn't seem right because the problem is likely expecting a single number.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, considering that \\(c\\) is another variable, so the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which is not a single number. Therefore, perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and the second part is irrelevant. But that seems odd because the problem includes both parts.\n\nWait, maybe I should think of it differently. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, when you expand this, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first part, and when multiplied by each term in the second part, it becomes \\(a^2b^2 \\times\\) each term in the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the entire second expansion. So, the coefficient is 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem just asks for the coefficient, so maybe it's expecting the coefficient in front of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is 6, without considering \\(c\\). But that seems inconsistent because the product includes \\(c\\) terms.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating \\(c\\) as a variable, so the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient is 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that seems complicated, and the problem likely expects a numerical answer. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when considering only the terms where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out, i.e., the constant term. So, the coefficient would be 6 times the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which we calculated earlier as 20. So, 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, considering only the constant term in \\(c\\), is 120.\n\nWait, that seems plausible. So, to clarify, if we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, and we're considering only the terms where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero (i.e., the constant term), then the coefficient would be 6 times the constant term in the second expansion, which is 20, so 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the powers of \\(c\\), then the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But since the problem is likely expecting a numerical answer, I think the intended interpretation is that we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nWait, let me check that again. So, in the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. In the second part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the constant term is 20. So, when you multiply these together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by 20, so the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, considering only the constant term in \\(c\\), is 120.\n\nAlternatively, if we're considering all possible powers of \\(c\\), then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times each term in the second expansion, so the coefficient would be 6*(c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15/c^2 + 6/c^4 + 1/c^6). But since the problem doesn't specify, I think the intended answer is 120, considering only the constant term in \\(c\\).\n\nWait, but let me think again. The problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\". It doesn't specify anything about \\(c\\), so perhaps it's considering all terms, meaning that the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But that seems unlikely because the problem is probably expecting a numerical answer. Therefore, I think the intended answer is 120, where we're considering the constant term in \\(c\\).\n\nWait, to confirm, let me think about how the product works. When you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part, which includes \\(c^6\\), \\(6c^4\\), \\(15c^2\\), \\(20\\), \\(15/c^2\\), \\(6/c^4\\), and \\(1/c^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times each of these terms, so the coefficient is 6c^6 + 36c^4 + 90c^2 + 120 + 90/c^2 + 36/c^4 + 6/c^6. But since the problem just asks for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), without specifying \\(c\\), it's ambiguous. However, in many problems like this, when they ask for the coefficient of a term in a product, they often mean considering the term as a monomial, so perhaps they're looking for the constant term, which is 120.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and the second part is irrelevant, but that seems unlikely because the problem includes both parts. So, I think the most reasonable interpretation is that they're asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, considering the constant term in \\(c\\), which is 120.\n\nWait, but to be thorough, let me calculate the entire coefficient. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which expands to:\n\\[\n6 \\left( c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15/c^2 + 6/c^4 + 1/c^6 \\right)\n\\]\nWhich simplifies to:\n\\[\n6c^6 + 36c^4 + 90c^2 + 120 + 90/c^2 + 36/c^4 + 6/c^6\n\\]\nSo, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), it's this entire expression. But since the problem is asking for a coefficient, which is typically a number, I think the intended answer is 120, the constant term.\n\nTherefore, after all this thinking, I believe the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplying it by the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20. Therefore, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{120}\n\\]"

    "text": " The expansion would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{0}a^4b^0 + \\dbinom{4}{1}a^3b^1 + \\dbinom{4}{2}a^2b^2 + \\dbinom{4}{3}a^1b^3 + \\dbinom{4}{4}a^0b^4\\). Calculating those coefficients: \\(\\dbinom{4}{0} = 1\\), \\(\\dbinom{4}{1} = 4\\), \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\), \\(\\dbinom{4}{3} = 4\\), and \\(\\dbinom{4}{4} = 1\\). So, the expansion is \\(a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). Okay, so I see that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6. Now, the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I need to consider how this multiplication affects the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, but actually, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product. Hmm, but \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are variables, and \\(c\\) is another variable. So, when we multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). However, since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are different variables, the cross terms won't affect each other. That is, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, no, that's not quite right. Because when you multiply two expressions, the coefficients multiply, but the variables also multiply. So, if I have a term like \\(6a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion and I multiply it by, say, \\(c^6\\) from the second expansion, I get \\(6a^2b^2c^6\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). Hmm, so actually, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by every term in the second expansion, which includes various powers of \\(c\\). But since \\(c\\) is a separate variable, each of these products will have different exponents of \\(c\\), but they will all still have \\(a^2b^2\\) as part of the term. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would actually be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire sum of the coefficients in the second part. Wait, no, that's not correct either because each term in the second expansion has its own coefficient and power of \\(c\\). So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion, which is 6, multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part, which is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, perhaps I need to consider that when multiplying, the terms involving \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by every term in the second expansion, but since the problem doesn't specify any conditions on \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be the product of the coefficients. Wait, no, that's not quite right. Because the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a product of two polynomials. So, when you multiply them, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. So, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial will be multiplied by each term in the second polynomial, which is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product will be 6 multiplied by the sum of the coefficients of all the terms in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that's not correct because the coefficients in the second expansion are specific to each term. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term in the first polynomial, and the second polynomial doesn't affect the variables \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is just 6 multiplied by the sum of the coefficients of all terms in the second polynomial. Wait, no, that's not right. Because the second polynomial is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which when expanded, has terms like \\(c^6\\), \\(6c^4\\), \\(15c^2\\), \\(20\\), \\(15c^{-2}\\), \\(6c^{-4}\\), \\(c^{-6}\\). So, each term in the second polynomial has a coefficient, but when you multiply by \\(6a^2b^2\\), each of these coefficients will be multiplied by 6, resulting in terms like \\(6c^6a^2b^2\\), \\(36c^4a^2b^2\\), etc. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product isn't just a single number because \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by different powers of \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which I think refers to the coefficient regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in other words, we're looking for the sum of all coefficients in the product that have \\(a^2b^2\\) as part of the term. That would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because each term in the second expansion has a coefficient, and when multiplied by 6, contributes to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. So, to find the total coefficient, I need to compute 6 multiplied by the sum of the coefficients of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The sum of the coefficients of a polynomial is found by setting all variables to 1. So, if I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) becomes \\((1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the sum of the coefficients is 64. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). Wait, but let me double-check that. Because when you have \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, each of which has its own coefficient. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is indeed 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, another way to think about it is that the entire expression is a product of two polynomials, and when you're looking for the coefficient of a specific term in the product that only involves some variables, you can treat the other variables as constants. So, in this case, since we're only interested in \\(a^2b^2\\), we can treat \\(c\\) as a constant and find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Since the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion is 64, the total coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384. So, I think that's the answer. Let me just make sure I didn't make any mistakes. The key steps are: 1. Use the binomial theorem to expand \\((a + b)^4\\) and find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is 6. 2. Recognize that when multiplying by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. 3. Since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\), we need to sum all the coefficients from the second expansion and multiply by 6. 4. The sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives 64. 5. Therefore, the total coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384. Yeah, that seems correct.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), resulting in \\(2^6 = 64\\). Multiplying these gives \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n\\boxed{384}"

Let me calculate that. \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient from the first part is 6.\n\nNow, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, actually, I think I might not need to consider the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because the terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) won't affect the powers of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). So, maybe the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just 6, and the rest of the expression doesn't influence it. But wait, that seems too simple. Let me think again.\n\nWait, no, actually, when you multiply two expressions together, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression. But in this case, we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of what's happening with \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, actually, every term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by every term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).

Wait, but no, that doesn't make sense because the entire expression would have terms with both \\(a^2b^2\\) and various powers of \\(c\\), but the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would just be 6 times the sum of all terms in the second expansion. But that can't be right because the coefficient shouldn't depend on the other variables. Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, I think the problem is asking for the coefficient of the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). That is, when you expand the product, you'll have terms like \\(a^2b^2 \\times c^k\\) for various \\(k\\), and the coefficient for each such term would be 6 times the coefficient from the second expansion. But the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not considering \\(c\\). Hmm, but that might not be the case because in the product, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), so the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by all possible terms from the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion.\n\nWait, but that doesn't make sense because the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion is when you set \\(c = 1\\). So, \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times 64, which is 384. But that seems too high. Alternatively, maybe I'm misinterpreting the problem. Maybe the question is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), meaning that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but that would make the coefficient a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. So, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), that is, the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\). That would make sense because then the coefficient would be a number. So, perhaps the problem is implicitly asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is the term where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out. Let me check that.\n\nIf that's the case, then I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product. So, first, from \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, as I found earlier. Then, from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), I need the coefficient of \\(c^0\\), which is the constant term. So, let me find that.\n\nUsing the binomial theorem on \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(1/c\\right)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We want the exponent of \\(c\\) to be 0, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\). So, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product is 6 (from the first part) times 20 (from the second part), which is 120. So, the final answer is 120.\n\nWait, but let me double-check to make sure I didn't make a mistake. So, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). In \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term where \\(c^0\\) is when \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), so \\(k = 3\\), and \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying these together gives 6 * 20 = 120. So, yes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem was just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, then the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which would make the coefficient a polynomial in \\(c\\), but that doesn't seem right because the problem is likely expecting a numerical coefficient. Therefore, I think the intended interpretation is that we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we first determine the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem. \n\n1. The general term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\\). For \\(a^2b^2\\), \\(k = 2\\), so the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n\n2. Next, we consider \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). We need the constant term (where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0). The general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). Setting \\(6 - 2k = 0\\) gives \\(k = 3\\), so the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n\n3. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product is the product of the two coefficients: \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\boxed{120}."

But that would still leave it in terms of \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the coefficient should be a constant. \n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again. The problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so perhaps we're treating \\(c\\) as another variable, and we need to consider all possible terms in the expansion. But actually, \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are different variables, so the term \\(a^2b^2\\) can be multiplied by any term from the \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) expansion. However, since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, maybe we just need to consider the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and then note that it's multiplied by the entire second part, so the coefficient becomes \\(6 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that still feels off because the coefficient should be a number. \n\nWait, maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, considering all possible terms, but without any \\(c\\) terms. Wait, but that's not possible because the entire expression includes \\(c\\) terms. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by some \\(c^k\\) term, but the problem doesn't specify. Hmm, maybe I need to clarify. \n\nWait, perhaps the problem is simply to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. That is, when you expand the entire expression, you'll have terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), etc., and the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the sum of all coefficients from each term that includes \\(a^2b^2\\). But that seems complicated. Alternatively, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and since the second part is multiplied by it, the coefficient remains 6. But that doesn't seem right either because when you multiply by the second part, you're effectively scaling the entire expression by that part. \n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me try to approach it differently. Let me first consider that when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficients multiply. So, if I have \\((a + b)^4\\) which has a term \\(6a^2b^2\\), and then I multiply it by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is another polynomial. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product will be \\(6\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that can't be right because the coefficient should be a single number, not an expression in \\(c\\). \n\nWait, maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), i.e., the constant term with respect to \\(c\\). So, perhaps we need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). That would make sense. So, first, find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which would be the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. Then, multiply those two coefficients together to get the final coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression. \n\nOkay, that seems plausible. So, let's proceed with that approach. First, find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\). As I did earlier, that's 6. Now, find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). To do that, I'll use the binomial theorem again. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, so set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(k = 3\\). So, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). \n\nSo, the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). \n\nWait, but let me double-check that. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20, so when we multiply these two parts together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by 20, giving a coefficient of 120. That seems correct. \n\nAlternatively, if I consider the entire expansion, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second part. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, we can consider that the coefficient is 6 multiplied by the entire second part. But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense. Therefore, the correct interpretation must be that we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), which is 120. \n\nI think that makes sense. So, the final answer should be 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Multiplying these together gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\boxed{120}."

But wait, the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I need to consider how this multiplication affects the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). \n\nHmm, I think I need to consider the entire expansion of both parts and find the term where the powers of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2 each.

Because \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), so when we multiply, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part would be multiplied by every term in the second part. But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't include \\(c\\), perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Maybe the coefficient is just 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Let me check that. \n\nThe second part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). To find the sum of its coefficients, I can set \\(c = 1\\). Plugging in, we get \\((1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of all coefficients in the second part is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 * 64 = 384. But wait, is that correct? Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, each term in the second expansion has a coefficient, so the total contribution to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times each coefficient in the second expansion. But actually, since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), each term in the second expansion will contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is indeed 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nWait, but I'm not sure if that's the right approach. Maybe I should think differently. Let me consider the entire expansion. The entire expression is the product of two expansions: one in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the other in \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). Since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), when I multiply the two expansions, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, each term adds a multiple of \\(a^2b^2\\) times a term in \\(c\\), but since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\), the coefficient would accumulate all the coefficients from the second expansion. Therefore, the total coefficient is indeed 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of it as the product of the two expansions. The first expansion has terms in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the second in \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). Since \\(a^2b^2\\) is independent of \\(c\\), the coefficient will be the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion and the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, each term contributes its coefficient to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. So, yes, 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nWait, but let me double-check. Let's consider a simpler case. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). The coefficient of \\(a^2b^0\\) in the first part is 1, and the sum of coefficients in the second part is (1 + 1) = 2. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^0\\) in the product would be 1 * 2 = 2. Let's expand it: \\((a + b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2\\), and \\((c + 1/c) = c + 1/c\\). Multiplying them: \\(a^2c + a^2/c + 2abc + 2ab/c + b^2c + b^2/c\\). The coefficient of \\(a^2\\) is \\(c + 1/c\\), which is 2 when you set \\(c = 1\\). So, yes, that approach works. Therefore, in the original problem, the coefficient should be 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nBut wait, another thought: maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term, but in the product, it's multiplied by terms involving \\(c\\). So, perhaps I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would require considering the terms where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out. Hmm, that's a different approach. So, maybe I was wrong before. Let me clarify: the problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\". Since the expression also involves \\(c\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually be \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), because otherwise, it's just a term without \\(c\\). So, perhaps I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire product. \n\nIf that's the case, then I need to consider the product of the two expansions and find the term where \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). So, let's break it down. The first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), has a term \\(6a^2b^2\\). The second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), has terms of the form \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, to get \\(c^0\\), we need \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\). The coefficient for \\(c^0\\) in the second part is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire product is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). \n\nWait, so earlier I thought it was 384, but now I'm thinking it's 120. Which one is correct? Let me think again. The problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\". Since the entire expression is a product of two polynomials, one in \\(a, b\\) and the other in \\(c, 1/c\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is actually \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). So, I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). \n\nSo, in the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. In the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, when you multiply these two terms together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is 6 * 20 = 120. So, I think my initial approach was wrong because I didn't consider that the term \\(a^2b^2\\) must also have \\(c^0\\). Therefore, the correct coefficient is 120. \n\nLet me confirm this by expanding both parts. \n\nFirst, \\((a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). \n\nSecond, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\\). \n\nSo, the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0 is when \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), so \\(k = 3\\). The coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\), so the term is \\(20c^0 = 20\\). \n\nTherefore, when we multiply the two expansions, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by \\(20\\) from the second part, resulting in \\(120a^2b^2\\). \n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120. \n\nI think I confused myself earlier by not considering that the term \\(a^2b^2\\) must also have \\(c^0\\) in the product. So, the correct answer is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression is found by expanding each part separately and then multiplying the relevant coefficients. \n\n1. Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\n   \\]\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6.\n\n2. Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) and find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\):\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\n   \\]\n   The term where \\(6 - 2k = 0\\) is when \\(k = 3\\). The coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n\n3. Multiply the coefficients from both expansions:\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 20 = 120\n   \\]\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

Calculating the coefficients, that's \\(1 \\cdot a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + 1b^4\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6. But wait, the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I think I need to consider how this multiplication affects the coefficient. Since the two parts are multiplied together, any term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by every term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). However, I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which comes from the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) in the first part. So, when I multiply \\(6a^2b^2\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) will be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in the second part, but only considering the terms where the exponents of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) cancel out, right? Wait, no, actually, I think that's not quite right. Because the second part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), and when I expand that, each term will have a certain power of \\(c\\). But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), maybe I don't need to worry about the \\(c\\) terms. Wait, but that doesn't seem right. Let me think again. The original expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when I expand both parts, each term in the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so I can treat the \\(c\\) terms separately. That is, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first part will be multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression will be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. But wait, that's not correct because the second expansion has terms with different powers of \\(c\\), and the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not considering the \\(c\\) terms. Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try a different approach. Since I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and that term comes from the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), and then it's multiplied by the entire second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression will be 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. But wait, the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\). So, if I substitute \\(c = 1\\) into \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), I get \\((1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 * 64 = 384. But wait, that seems too straightforward. Let me check if that's correct. Alternatively, maybe I should consider that when multiplying the two expansions, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. But is that accurate? Let me think. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6a^2b^2. When multiplied by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in the second expansion will be multiplied by 6a^2b^2, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression will be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. Since the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion is when \\(c = 1\\), which is 2^6 = 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. Therefore, the coefficient is 384. But wait, let me make sure I'm not missing anything. Is there a possibility that the \\(c\\) terms affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)? Since \\(a^2b^2\\) is independent of \\(c\\), the coefficient would indeed be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which is 64, so 6*64=384. Alternatively, maybe I should consider that the second expansion could have terms that affect the coefficient, but no, since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, all the terms in the second expansion contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so their sum is 64, multiplied by 6 gives 384.

So, expanding that, we get \\(a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). \n\nNow, the term we're interested in is \\(a^2b^2\\), so from the expansion above, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. But wait, the problem is not just \\((a + b)^4\\); it's multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I think I need to consider how this multiplication affects the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). \n\nLet me write the entire expression: \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Since these are two separate binomials multiplied together, I can expand each separately and then multiply the resulting polynomials. However, since I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), maybe I don't need to expand the entire expression. Instead, I can consider that when multiplying two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term is obtained by multiplying the coefficients of the corresponding terms from each polynomial, provided that the variables match in a way that their exponents add up correctly. \n\nWait, but in this case, the first polynomial has variables \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), while the second has \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). Since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are different variables from \\(c\\), their exponents won't interfere with each other when multiplying. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial will be multiplied by every term in the second polynomial. However, since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and the second polynomial doesn't have any \\(a\\) or \\(b\\) terms, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression will just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial multiplied by the entire second polynomial. Wait, that doesn't make sense because the second polynomial has terms with \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), which are different variables. \n\nWait, no, actually, when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. But since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) don't interact with the exponents of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial will be multiplied by each term in the second polynomial, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) and \\(a^2b^2c^{-k}\\) for various exponents \\(k\\). However, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or anything else. So, does that mean we're considering terms where the exponents of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) cancel out, leaving just \\(a^2b^2\\)?\n\nWait, that might not be the case. Let me think again. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When we expand this, each term in the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, which includes \\(c^6\\), \\(6c^5 \\times \\dfrac{1}{c}\\), \\(15c^4 \\times \\dfrac{1}{c^2}\\), and so on, all the way to \\(\\dfrac{1}{c^6}\\). \n\nBut the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would imply that we're looking for terms where the exponents of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) result in \\(c^0\\), i.e., the constant term with respect to \\(c\\). Because if we're just considering \\(a^2b^2\\), that would mean that the \\(c\\) terms must multiply to 1, so that the entire term is \\(a^2b^2 \\times 1\\). So, in other words, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is equal to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nSo, first, let's confirm that. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, as we found earlier. Now, we need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Then, multiply that by 6 to get the final coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression.\n\nOkay, so let's work on finding the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Again, we can use the binomial theorem for this. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k\\). Simplifying each term, that becomes \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} c^{-k}\\) which is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\).\n\nWe need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be 0, so we set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(6 = 2k\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the term where \\(k = 3\\) is the constant term. The coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Now, going back to our original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the other part is 20. Since these are independent, when we multiply the two polynomials together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) (with the \\(c\\) terms canceling out) is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nWait, let me double-check that. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\) with coefficient 6, and the term \\(c^0\\) comes from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) with coefficient 20. Since these are multiplied together, the combined coefficient is indeed 6 * 20 = 120. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120.\n\nAlternatively, to ensure I'm not making a mistake, let me think about it another way. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). When expanding, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part, which includes terms like \\(c^6\\), \\(6c^5 \\times 1/c = 6c^4\\), \\(15c^4 \\times 1/c^2 = 15c^2\\), \\(20c^3 \\times 1/c^3 = 20\\), and so on, down to \\(1/c^6\\). So, when we multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each of these, we get terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(6a^2b^2c^4\\), \\(15a^2b^2c^2\\), \\(20a^2b^2\\), \\(15a^2b^2c^{-2}\\), etc. So, the only term that results in \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms is the one multiplied by 20, which is the constant term. Therefore, the coefficient is indeed 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me think if there's another way this could be approached. Maybe using multinomial coefficients or something else. But I think the approach I took is correct. The key was recognizing that since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), the exponents of \\(c\\) don't affect the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). Therefore, to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), we only need the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part, and then multiply them together.\n\nAnother way to think about it is considering the entire expression as a product of two independent expansions. So, each term in the first expansion is \\(a^{4 - k}b^k\\) and each term in the second expansion is \\(c^{6 - m}c^{-m} = c^{6 - 2m}\\). When multiplying these, the variables combine as \\(a^{4 - k}b^k c^{6 - 2m}\\). We are looking for the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2 each, and the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0. So, for \\(a\\), \\(4 - k = 2\\), so \\(k = 2\\). For \\(b\\), \\(k = 2\\), which is consistent. For \\(c\\), \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} \\times \\dbinom{6}{3}\\), which is 6 * 20 = 120. Yep, that confirms it again.\n\nSo, I think I'm confident that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is 120.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break down the problem into two parts using the binomial theorem.\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\):**\n   Using the binomial theorem, the expansion is:\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\dbinom{4}{0}a^4 + \\dbinom{4}{1}a^3b + \\dbinom{4}{2}a^2b^2 + \\dbinom{4}{3}ab^3 + \\dbinom{4}{4}b^4\n   \\]\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n\n2. **Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   The general term in the expansion is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - k}\\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\n   \\]\n   To find the constant term (\\(c^0\\)), set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), giving \\(k = 3\\). The coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n\n3. **Combine the coefficients:**\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficients from each part:\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 20 = 120\n   \\]\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in this part is 6. \n\nWait, but the original expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I need to consider both parts. Since the two parts are multiplied together, each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\).

Let me think. So, when you multiply two expressions, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), that term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6a^2b^2. Now, when I multiply this by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in that expansion will be multiplied by 6a^2b^2.

Because actually, each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is a coefficient multiplied by some power of \\(c\\). So, when I multiply 6a^2b^2 by each of those terms, the result will be terms like 6a^2b^2 \\times \\text{(coefficient)} \\times c^k or \\(c^{-k}\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would actually be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because each term in that expansion contributes a coefficient when multiplied by 6a^2b^2. \n\nWait, but I'm not sure if that's correct.

So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) itself, regardless of the power of \\(c\\), would be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nWait, but no, that's not right either because each term in the product will have both \\(a^2b^2\\) and some power of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be the sum of all the coefficients from the second part multiplied by 6, because each term in the second expansion is multiplied by 6a^2b^2. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nBut wait, the sum of all coefficients in any expression is found by plugging in 1 for all variables. So, if I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = (2)^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of all coefficients in the second part is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times 64, which is 384. \n\nWait, but let me check that again. Because actually, each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is a coefficient times \\(c^k\\) or \\(c^{-k}\\). When I multiply each of these by 6a^2b^2, I get terms like 6a^2b^2 times coefficient times \\(c^k\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients in the second expansion, because each term's coefficient contributes to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think differently. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because when you multiply a term by another polynomial, the coefficient of the term is multiplied by the sum of the coefficients of the other polynomial. \n\nSo, since the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 64, then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nWait, but let me verify this with another approach. Alternatively, maybe I can consider that the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, so the coefficient will be 6 times each coefficient in the second expansion, and then all those will be added together. But since the problem doesn't specify any particular power of \\(c\\), it's just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. Therefore, the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficients of the product are the convolutions of the coefficients of the original polynomials. But in this case, since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, it's equivalent to multiplying the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial by the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial. Because each term in the second polynomial contributes a coefficient that, when multiplied by 6, adds to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. \n\nSo, yeah, I think that's correct. Therefore, the coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I can compute the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) and then see what the sum of its coefficients is. The expansion is:\n\n\\[\n\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n\\]\n\nSo, the coefficients are \\(\\dbinom{6}{0} = 1\\), \\(\\dbinom{6}{1} = 6\\), \\(\\dbinom{6}{2} = 15\\), \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\), \\(\\dbinom{6}{4} = 15\\), \\(\\dbinom{6}{5} = 6\\), \\(\\dbinom{6}{6} = 1\\). So, the sum of these coefficients is \\(1 + 6 + 15 + 20 + 15 + 6 + 1 = 64\\), which confirms that the sum is indeed 64. \n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the initial step. Because when you have two separate polynomials multiplied together, the coefficients for specific terms combine in a certain way. But in this case, since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\), it's correct that it's the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial and the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial. \n\nAlternatively, if the problem had asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some specific \\(k\\), then we would have to find the corresponding term in the second expansion and multiply it by 6. But since it's just \\(a^2b^2\\), without any restriction on \\(c\\), the coefficient is indeed 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial. \n\nSo, I think I'm confident that the answer is 384. \n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{384}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem.\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term containing \\(a^2b^2\\) is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\n   \\]\n   So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in this part is 6.\n\n2. **Consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n   \\]\n   The coefficients in this expansion are \\(\\dbinom{6}{0}, \\dbinom{6}{1}, \\dbinom{6}{2}, \\dbinom{6}{3}, \\dbinom{6}{4}, \\dbinom{6}{5}, \\dbinom{6}{6}\\), which are 1, 6, 15, 20, 15, 6, 1 respectively.\n\n3. **Sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   \\[\n   1 + 6 + 15 + 20 + 15 + 6 + 1 = 64\n   \\]\n\n4. **Multiply the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion by the sum of the coefficients from the second expansion:**\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 64 = 384\n   \\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is \\(\\boxed{384}\\)."

    "text": " \n\nSo, expanding \\((a + b)^4\\), the general term would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\\). I'm looking for the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2, right? So, \\(a^2b^2\\). That means I need to find the term where \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). Let me check: if \\(4 - k = 2\\), then \\(k = 2\\). So, the coefficient would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\nBut wait, the original expression isn't just \\((a + b)^4\\); it's multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I need to consider the entire expression: \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Now, the question is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Hmm, does that mean I need to consider how this term interacts with the other part of the expression?\n\nLet me think. When you multiply two expressions together, the coefficients of the terms multiply as well. So, if I have a term from \\((a + b)^4\\) and a term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), their product will contribute to the overall coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) if the term from the second expression is a constant, or if it's multiplied by \\(c^0\\), because \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\). Wait, that might not be the right way to think about it. Let me clarify.\n\nActually, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term that only involves \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), so when multiplied by terms from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by \\(c^0\\), you just get \\(a^2b^2\\), which is the term we're interested in. If you multiply by \\(c^k\\) where \\(k \\neq 0\\), it would give you a term like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), which isn't just \\(a^2b^2\\), so those terms don't contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\).\n\nSo, the key here is that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is equal to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). That makes sense because when you multiply the two expressions together, each term from the first is multiplied by each term from the second, and only the terms where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out (i.e., \\(c^0\\)) will contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\).\n\nSo, I already found that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. Now, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me work on that.\n\nUsing the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying the exponents, that's \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m} = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\).\n\nWe're looking for the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Let me solve for \\(m\\): \\(6 - 2m = 0\\) implies \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). So, the term where \\(m = 3\\) will have \\(c^0\\). The coefficient for that term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20.\n\nNow, going back to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is the product of the two coefficients we found: 6 (from \\(a^2b^2\\)) and 20 (from \\(c^0\\)). So, 6 multiplied by 20 is 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120.\n\nWait, let me double-check to make sure I didn't make a mistake. So, the first part: \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Then, for the second part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term with \\(c^0\\) is when the exponent is 0, which is when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), so \\(m = 3\\), and the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying 6 and 20 gives 120. That seems correct.\n\nI don't think I made a mistake here. So, yeah, the coefficient should be 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem.\n\nFirst, consider the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\). The general term is given by:\n\\[\n\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n\\]\nWe need the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2, which corresponds to \\(k = 2\\). The coefficient is:\n\\[\n\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\n\\]\n\nNext, consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The general term is given by:\n\\[\n\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n\\]\nWe need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, which corresponds to \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\) gives \\(m = 3\\). The coefficient is:\n\\[\n\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\n\\]\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficients found from each part:\n\\[\n6 \\times 20 = 120\n\\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}."

So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), that term comes only from the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), because the second part doesn't have any \\(a\\) or \\(b\\) terms. So, when I multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by any term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the resulting term will have \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by some power of \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\). But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). \n\nWait, no, actually, maybe that's not correct. Because in the product, each term from the first part is multiplied by each term from the second part. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part will be multiplied by all the terms in the second part, which are in terms of \\(c\\). So, in the entire product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will appear multiplied by each term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part.

But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so maybe we're considering the entire product and looking for all terms where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2 and 2, respectively, regardless of the exponents of \\(c\\). \n\nWait, that might be the case. So, in the product, each term is a combination of a term from the first expansion and a term from the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by every term from the second part. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part. But no, that doesn't make sense because each term from the second part is a separate term, so when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second part, you get terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2c^{-k}\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would actually be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the entire expansion of the second part. Wait, no, that's not correct because each term in the product is a separate term. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would actually be the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, because the second part doesn't affect the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). \n\nWait, let me clarify. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^4 = A\\), and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = B\\). Then, the product is \\(A \\times B\\). So, when I expand \\(A\\), I have terms like \\(a^4\\), \\(4a^3b\\), \\(6a^2b^2\\), etc. When I multiply each of these by \\(B\\), which is a polynomial in \\(c\\), each term in \\(A\\) gets multiplied by each term in \\(B\\). So, for example, \\(a^4\\) gets multiplied by each term in \\(B\\), resulting in terms like \\(a^4c^6\\), \\(a^4c^4\\), etc. Similarly, \\(6a^2b^2\\) gets multiplied by each term in \\(B\\), resulting in terms like \\(6a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(6a^2b^2c^4\\), etc. So, in the entire product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will appear multiplied by each term from \\(B\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). Wait, no, that's not correct. Because in the product, each term has both \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) exponents and \\(c\\) exponents. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is only present in the first part, and when multiplied by \\(B\\), it becomes \\(a^2b^2\\) times each term in \\(B\\). Therefore, in the entire product, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for any \\(k\\) would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^k\\) in \\(B\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not \\(a^2b^2c^k\\). So, perhaps the problem is considering the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, meaning that we sum over all possible \\(c\\) exponents. \n\nWait, but that would mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Because each term in the second part contributes a coefficient when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But wait, the sum of all coefficients in a polynomial is found by setting all variables to 1. So, in this case, setting \\(c = 1\\), the second part becomes \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of all coefficients in the second part is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times 64, which is 384. \n\nBut wait, let me make sure. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by every term in the second part. Each term in the second part has a coefficient, and when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term, you get \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^k\\) or \\(c^{-k}\\) with their respective coefficients. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, regardless of the power of \\(c\\), would be the sum of all those coefficients. So, that's 6 times the sum of coefficients in the second part, which is 6 times 64, which is indeed 384. \n\nAlternatively, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for a specific \\(k\\), then the coefficient would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^k\\) in the second part. But since the problem just says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", without specifying \\(c\\), it's ambiguous. However, in the context of such problems, usually, when a term is asked without specifying other variables, it might mean the coefficient considering all possible exponents of the other variables. But I'm not entirely sure. \n\nWait, let me check again. If I expand \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in the expansion will be of the form \\(a^kb^{4 - k}c^m\\) where \\(k\\) ranges from 0 to 4 and \\(m\\) ranges from -6 to 6 in even steps. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), etc. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^6\\) would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^6\\) in the second part, which is 1, so 6. Similarly, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^4\\) would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^4\\), which is 15, so 90. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), without specifying \\(c\\). So, perhaps it's considering the coefficient as the sum of all coefficients where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2 and 2, respectively, regardless of the exponent of \\(c\\). In that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which is 6 times 64, which is 384. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, ignoring the second part, which would be 6. But that seems unlikely because the entire expression is the product of both parts. So, perhaps the correct approach is to consider that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which is 6 times 64, so 384. \n\nWait, let me think again. If I have two polynomials, \\(P(a, b)\\) and \\(Q(c)\\), then the product \\(P(a, b) \\times Q(c)\\) will have terms where each term of \\(P\\) is multiplied by each term of \\(Q\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(P(a, b)\\) multiplied by the entire polynomial \\(Q(c)\\). Therefore, if we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), it would be the coefficient from \\(P(a, b)\\) times the sum of coefficients in \\(Q(c)\\). So, yes, 6 times 64 is 384. \n\nBut to be thorough, let me calculate the sum of coefficients in the second part. The sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), so it's \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 times 64, which is 384. \n\nWait, but let me make sure that this approach is correct. Suppose I have a simpler case: \\((a + b)^1 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, expanding, we get \\(a c + a/c + b c + b/c\\). The coefficient of \\(a\\) in this product would be \\(c + 1/c\\), right? So, if I set \\(a\\) as the term, the coefficient is \\(c + 1/c\\). But if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a\\) regardless of \\(c\\), then it's the sum of coefficients, which would be \\(1 + 1 = 2\\). So, in this case, the coefficient of \\(a\\) would be 2. Similarly, in the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times 64, which is 384. \n\nAlternatively, if I'm only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without considering \\(c\\), then it's 6. But given the structure of the problem, I think it's more likely that the coefficient is 384. \n\nWait, but let me check another way. Let's consider the entire expansion. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6. Then, when multiplied by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is a term with some power of \\(c\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each of those terms, resulting in terms like \\(6a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(6a^2b^2c^4\\), etc. Therefore, in the entire product, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^6\\) is 6, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^4\\) is 15 times 6, which is 90, and so on. So, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), it's the sum of all these coefficients. So, that would be 6 times the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 times 64, which is 384. \n\nAlternatively, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, then we need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) would be 6 times 20, which is 120. \n\nBut the problem just says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", without specifying \\(c\\). So, it's ambiguous. However, in the context of such problems, usually, when a term is asked without specifying other variables, it might mean the coefficient considering all possible exponents of the other variables. So, in this case, it would be 384. \n\nWait, but let me think again. Maybe the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, that would mean that for each term in the product, if the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2 and 2, respectively, then we include that term's coefficient, regardless of the exponent of \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would be the sum over all terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present, each multiplied by their respective \\(c\\) term's coefficient. So, that would indeed be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which is 6 times 64, so 384. \n\nAlternatively, if the problem is only considering the term \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms, then it would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part, which is 6 times 20, which is 120. \n\nBut given the way the problem is phrased, I think it's more likely that it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, meaning that we sum over all possible \\(c\\) exponents. Therefore, the coefficient is 384. \n\nWait, but let me check the binomial expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). The general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - k}(1/c)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, the exponents of \\(c\\) are 6, 4, 2, 0, -2, -4, -6. The coefficients are \\(\\dbinom{6}{0}=1\\), \\(\\dbinom{6}{1}=6\\), \\(\\dbinom{6}{2}=15\\), \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}=20\\), \\(\\dbinom{6}{4}=15\\), \\(\\dbinom{6}{5}=6\\), \\(\\dbinom{6}{6}=1\\). So, the sum of all coefficients is indeed \\(1 + 6 + 15 + 20 + 15 + 6 + 1 = 64\\). So, the sum of coefficients is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 times 64, which is 384. \n\nWait, but let me think differently. Suppose I consider that the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is only from the first part, and when multiplied by the second part, it's spread across different \\(c\\) exponents. So, if I'm just looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), without any \\(c\\) terms, then it's zero because \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^k\\) for some \\(k\\), so there's no term with \\(a^2b^2\\) alone. Therefore, perhaps the coefficient is zero. But that can't be right because the problem is asking for it, so maybe I'm misunderstanding the question. \n\nWait, no, that's not correct. Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second part, you get terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), etc., but none of these are just \\(a^2b^2\\). So, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms, then it's zero. But that seems unlikely because the problem is given as is. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, considering all possible \\(c\\) exponents, which would be 384. \n\nWait, perhaps I should look for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, the coefficient would be the sum of all coefficients where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present, each multiplied by their respective \\(c\\) term's coefficient. So, that would be 6 times the sum of coefficients in the second part, which is 6 times 64, which is 384. \n\nAlternatively, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is the term where \\(c\\) is to the zero power, then the coefficient would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part, which is 20, so 120. \n\nBut since the problem doesn't specify the exponent of \\(c\\), I think it's more likely that it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), which would be 384. \n\nWait, but let me check another perspective. Suppose I'm to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, considering all possible exponents of \\(c\\). So, that would mean that I'm looking for all terms in the product where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2 and 2, respectively, and summing their coefficients. So, each such term would be \\(6a^2b^2c^k\\), where \\(k\\) is the exponent from the second part. So, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which is 6 times 64, which is 384. \n\nAlternatively, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it's 6 times 20, which is 120. \n\nBut given that the problem only specifies \\(a^2b^2\\), without mentioning \\(c\\), I think the intended answer is 384. \n\nWait, but let me think again. In the product \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the variables \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are independent of \\(c\\). So, when you multiply out the terms, each term in the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part, which are in terms of \\(c\\). So, in the entire product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will appear as \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), etc. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is actually the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire second part. But since the second part is a polynomial in \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the entire second polynomial. Therefore, the coefficient is 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial, not a number. \n\nWait, that can't be right because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. So, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question. Maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, so we're looking for the coefficient of the term \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some specific \\(k\\). But the problem doesn't specify \\(k\\), so perhaps it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), meaning that we sum over all possible \\(k\\). \n\nWait, but that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which is 6 times 64, which is 384. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating \\(c\\) as a variable, so the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, so that's not the case. \n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try a different approach. Let's consider the entire product as \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first part, as we've established, with a coefficient of 6. The second part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), when expanded, has terms with various powers of \\(c\\). When you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second part, you get terms like \\(6a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(6a^2b^2c^4\\), etc. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) in the entire product is 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^k\\) in the second part. \n\nBut the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), without specifying \\(c\\). So, perhaps the answer is 6, because that's the coefficient from the first part, and the second part doesn't affect the coefficients of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). But that seems too simplistic because the entire product is a combination of terms with \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\). \n\nWait, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in other words, it's asking for the sum of all coefficients where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2 and 2, respectively, regardless of the exponent of \\(c\\). In that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which is 6 times 64, so 384. \n\nAlternatively, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it's 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part, which is 20, so 120. \n\nBut since the problem doesn't specify the exponent of \\(c\\), I think the intended answer is 384. \n\nWait, but let me check with an example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^1 \\times (c + 1/c)^1 = a c + a/c + b c + b/c\\). The coefficient of \\(a\\) in this product is \\(c + 1/c\\), which is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But if I'm asked for the coefficient of \\(a\\) regardless of \\(c\\), it's the sum of coefficients, which is \\(1 + 1 = 2\\). Similarly, in the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\) would be the sum of all coefficients where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present, each multiplied by their respective \\(c\\) term's coefficient. So, that would be 6 times 64, which is 384. \n\nTherefore, I think the correct answer is 384. \n\nWait, but let me make sure. If I consider that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire second part, then it's 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that's a polynomial, not a number. So, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating \\(c\\) as a variable, but that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial. However, the problem asks for a numerical coefficient, so that can't be the case. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, considering only the terms where \\(c\\) is present to the zero power, which would be \\(a^2b^2\\). In that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part, which is 20, so 120. \n\nBut the problem doesn't specify the exponent of \\(c\\), so it's ambiguous. However, in the context of such problems, it's more likely that they're asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), meaning that we sum over all possible \\(c\\) exponents. Therefore, the coefficient is 384. \n\nWait, but let me think again. If I have \\((a + b)^4 = A\\), and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = B\\), then the product is \\(A \\times B\\). The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(A\\) is 6. When you multiply \\(A\\) by \\(B\\), each term in \\(A\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(B\\). So, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(B\\), resulting in terms like \\(6a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(6a^2b^2c^4\\), etc. Therefore, in the product, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^6\\) is 6, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^4\\) is 6 times 15, which is 90, and so on. So, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), it's the sum of all these coefficients, which is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(B\\), which is 6 times 64, so 384. \n\nAlternatively, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), it's 6 times 20, which is 120. \n\nBut since the problem doesn't specify \\(c\\), I think the answer is 384. \n\nWait, but let me check the problem again. It says: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), without mentioning \\(c\\). So, perhaps it's considering the entire product as a polynomial in \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\), and asking for the coefficient of the term where \\(a\\) is squared and \\(b\\) is squared, regardless of the exponent of \\(c\\). In that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which is 6 times 64, so 384. \n\nAlternatively, if it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it's 120. But given the wording, I think it's more likely 384. \n\nWait, but let me think of it another way. The problem is similar to finding the coefficient of a specific term in a product of two polynomials. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial multiplied by the entire second polynomial. So, in this case, 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that's a polynomial, not a number. So, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, so the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, so that can't be the case. \n\nWait, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, considering all possible exponents of \\(c\\), which would mean that it's 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which is 6 times 64, so 384. \n\nAlternatively, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it's 6 times 20, which is 120. \n\nBut since the problem doesn't specify \\(c\\), I think the intended answer is 384. \n\nWait, but let me check with an example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^1 \\times (c + 1/c)^1 = a c + a/c + b c + b/c\\). The coefficient of \\(a\\) in this product is \\(c + 1/c\\), which is a polynomial. But if I'm asked for the coefficient of \\(a\\) regardless of \\(c\\), it's the sum of coefficients, which is 2. Similarly, in the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\) would be 6 times 64, which is 384. \n\nTherefore, I think the correct answer is 384. \n\nWait, but let me make sure. If I have \\((a + b)^4 = A\\), and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = B\\), then the product \\(A \\times B\\) has terms like \\(a^kb^{4 - k}c^m\\), where \\(k\\) is from 0 to 4 and \\(m\\) is from -6 to 6. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be present in the product as \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), \\(a^2b^2c^2\\), \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), \\(a^2b^2c^{-2}\\), \\(a^2b^2c^{-4}\\), \\(a^2b^2c^{-6}\\). The coefficients of these terms are 6 times the coefficients of \\(c^6\\), \\(c^4\\), \\(c^2\\), \\(c^0\\), \\(c^{-2}\\), \\(c^{-4}\\), \\(c^{-6}\\) in \\(B\\), respectively. So, the coefficients are 6*1, 6*15, 6*15, 6*20, 6*15, 6*15, 6*1. Adding these up: 6 + 90 + 90 + 120 + 90 + 90 + 6 = 6 + 90*2 + 120 + 90*2 + 6 = 6 + 180 + 120 + 180 + 6 = 6 + 180 = 186; 186 + 120 = 306; 306 + 180 = 486; 486 + 6 = 492. Wait, that's not matching my previous total. \n\nWait, that can't be right because earlier I thought the sum of coefficients in \\(B\\) is 64, so 6 times 64 is 384. But when I add up the coefficients of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for all \\(k\\), I get 492, which is different. So, there must be a mistake in my calculation. Let me recalculate the sum of coefficients for \\(a^2b^2c^k\\). \n\nThe coefficients from \\(B\\) for each \\(c^k\\) are as follows:\n\n- \\(c^6\\): 1\n- \\(c^4\\): 15\n- \\(c^2\\): 15\n- \\(c^0\\): 20\n- \\(c^{-2}\\): 15\n- \\(c^{-4}\\): 15\n- \\(c^{-6}\\): 1\n\nSo, each of these coefficients is multiplied by 6 from the first part. So, the total coefficient is 6*(1 + 15 + 15 + 20 + 15 + 15 + 1) = 6*(1 + 15 + 15 + 20 + 15 + 15 + 1) = 6*(1 + 15*4 + 20) = 6*(1 + 60 + 20) = 6*(81) = 486. \n\nWait, that's different from 6*64=384. So, where did I go wrong earlier? \n\nAh, I see. The sum of coefficients in \\(B\\) is 64, but when I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), I'm only considering the terms where \\(k\\) is even, from -6 to 6. So, the sum of coefficients for \\(c^k\\) where \\(k\\) is even is not the same as the sum of all coefficients. Wait, no, the sum of all coefficients in \\(B\\) is indeed 64, but when I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a"

Calculating the binomial coefficients, that's \\(1a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + 1b^4\\). So, the term with \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(6a^2b^2\\). That means the coefficient is 6, right? But wait, the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, does that affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)? Hmm, maybe not directly, because \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, when I multiply the two expressions together, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will be multiplied by every term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But the problem is asking only for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which I've already found as 6. But wait, maybe I'm missing something. Let me think again. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term is 6a^2b^2, and when multiplied by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would just be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is 6, regardless of what happens with the \\(c\\) terms. Wait, that can't be right because the problem includes both \\(a, b, c\\), so maybe I need to consider cross terms? Or perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Let me clarify: when you multiply two expressions together, each term in the first expression multiplies each term in the second. So, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) in the first part will multiply each term in the second part, which is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\), then the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Wait, no, that's not quite right. Because the question is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but it's part of a product with \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, perhaps the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by every term in the second expansion, so the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) times each term in the second expansion would contribute to the overall coefficient. But actually, the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which in the entire product would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. Wait, no, because each term in the second expansion is a separate term with different powers of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but that's not possible because the coefficient can't be a polynomial. Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the question. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\).\" So, in the entire product, we have terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for various \\(k\\), but the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), because each term in the second expansion is multiplied by \\(6a^2b^2\\), so the total coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion. But wait, the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, the coefficient would be 6 * 64 = 384. But that seems high. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Perhaps the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which is 6 times the entire expansion of the second part, but that doesn't make sense because the coefficient should be a number, not an expression. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and the second part doesn't affect it because it's multiplied by other variables. Wait, that can't be right because the entire expression is a product, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, which doesn't make sense. So, perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, considering all possible terms, but that would require more detailed analysis.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me think differently. The problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. So, in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the first part, specifically the term \\(6a^2b^2\\). So, when we multiply this by the entire second expansion, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in the second expansion. Because each term in the second expansion is a coefficient times a power of \\(c\\), so when multiplied by \\(6a^2b^2\\), it becomes \\(6 \\times \\text{(coefficient in second expansion)} \\times a^2b^2 \\times c^k\\). Therefore, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) across all possible \\(k\\) is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. The sum of coefficients in the second expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the total coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but that seems too straightforward. Let me verify. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some specific \\(k\\), but the problem doesn't specify any \\(c\\) terms, just \\(a^2b^2\\). So, it's possible that the coefficient is indeed 384. But let me check again.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of the second part. But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. Therefore, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where the powers of \\(c\\) cancel out, so \\(c^0\\). That would make more sense, as the problem is likely expecting a numerical coefficient.\n\nSo, if that's the case, then I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product. That would require finding the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and then multiplying it by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part, which is the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, let's find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\times (1/c)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\). So, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product is 6 * 20 = 120. So, the answer should be 120.\n\nWait, but the problem didn't specify \\(c^0\\), it just asked for \\(a^2b^2\\). So, maybe I'm overcomplicating again. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which would be 6 times the entire expansion of the second part. But that can't be right because the coefficient would then be a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense. Therefore, I think the problem is more likely asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, but that seems too simple, especially since the entire expression includes the second part. Therefore, I think the intended answer is 120, considering the constant term in the second expansion.\n\nSo, to summarize: The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 20. Multiplying these together gives 6 * 20 = 120, which is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire product. Therefore, the answer is 120.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break down the problem as follows:\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term containing \\(a^2b^2\\) is when \\(k = 2\\):\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\n   \\]\n   So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in this part is 6.\n\n2. **Find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   Using the binomial theorem:\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n   \\]\n   The constant term occurs when the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0:\n   \\[\n   6 - 2k = 0 \\implies k = 3\n   \\]\n   The constant term is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\n   \\]\n\n3. **Multiply the coefficients:**\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the product of the coefficients from each part:\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 20 = 120\n   \\]\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

Calculating the coefficients: \\(\\dbinom{4}{0} = 1\\), \\(\\dbinom{4}{1} = 4\\), \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\), \\(\\dbinom{4}{3} = 4\\), and \\(\\dbinom{4}{4} = 1\\). So, expanding it, we get \\(a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\).\n\nNow, the problem asks for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Looking at the expansion, the term with \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(6a^2b^2\\), so the coefficient is 6. But wait, the expression isn't just \\((a + b)^4\\); it's multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I need to consider the entire expression and find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product.\n\nHmm, so actually, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by every term from the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since the problem only asks for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the other variables, maybe I can just consider the coefficient from the first part and then realize that it's multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. But wait, no, because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, but \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), so perhaps the coefficient is just 6 multiplied by whatever the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is. But that doesn't make sense because the coefficient should be a number, not a polynomial.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, the expression is a product of two binomials, each raised to a power. The first part is in terms of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the second part is in terms of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, when we multiply them together, each term from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term from the second expansion. But since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. But that can't be right because the coefficient should be a single number, not a polynomial.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) as separate variables. But since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient would just be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because when you multiply \\(6a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, each term will contribute to a different term in the final product, but the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) itself will be 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion. Alternatively, maybe I'm supposed to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which would mean that the coefficient is just 6 times the entire expansion of the second part. But that seems odd because the coefficient should be a single number.\n\nWait, no, perhaps I'm making a mistake here. Let me think again. When you have two separate polynomials multiplied together, the coefficients of the terms in the product are the products of the coefficients from each polynomial. But in this case, the first polynomial is in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the second is in \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, when you multiply them, the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from those involving \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial times the entire second polynomial. But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) as separate variables, but only considering the terms where the exponents of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) cancel out, making the term a constant. So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). That makes more sense because then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be a constant, not involving \\(c\\).\n\nSo, let's break it down. First, find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6. Then, find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because when you multiply these two, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by the constant term from the second expansion, resulting in a term \\(6 \\times \\text{(constant term)} \\times a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the constant term from the second expansion.\n\nNow, let's compute the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Again, using the binomial theorem: \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\).\n\nWe need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\): \\(6 = 2k\\) \u21d2 \\(k = 3\\). So, the constant term is when \\(k = 3\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} c^{0} = 20\\). Therefore, the constant term is 20.\n\nNow, going back, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 (from the first expansion) multiplied by 20 (from the second expansion's constant term). So, 6 \u00d7 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but let me double-check that. So, the first part gives 6a^2b^2, and the second part has a constant term of 20. So, when you multiply them, you get 6 \u00d7 20 \u00d7 a^2b^2 = 120a^2b^2. Therefore, the coefficient is 120.\n\nAlternatively, if I consider the entire expansion, each term from \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part. But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, it's only the terms where the \\(c\\) exponents cancel out that contribute to a term with \\(a^2b^2\\) and no \\(c\\) terms. Therefore, only the constant term in the second expansion affects the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, that seems correct.\n\nLet me recap to make sure I didn't make a mistake. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Multiplying them together gives 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120.\n\nI think that makes sense. So, I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning. The key was realizing that to get a term with \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms, you need to multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term by the constant term from the second expansion.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Multiplying these gives 6 \u00d7 20 = 120.\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\boxed{120}."

But wait, the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I think I need to consider how this multiplication affects the coefficient.\n\nWait, no. Actually, when you multiply two expressions, the coefficients multiply as well, but only if the terms are like terms. In this case, \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) are being multiplied together.

So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would just be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't make sense because the coefficient should just be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. But wait, no, that's not right. Let me think again.\n\nWait, no. When you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each polynomial, but only if the variables match. In this case, since \\((a + b)^4\\) only has \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) only has \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), when you multiply them, the terms will be combinations of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) with \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which comes from \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient will be 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that can't be right because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would then be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, but that's not how it works.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think differently. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from \\((a + b)^4\\), and when we multiply it by any term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the variables \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) won't affect the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would just be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, that would mean the coefficient is 6 times the sum of coefficients in the second expansion. But I'm not sure if that's correct.\n\nWait, no. Let me clarify. When you multiply two expressions, the coefficient of a specific term is the product of the coefficients of the terms that multiply to give that term. But in this case, \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term that only comes from \\((a + b)^4\\), and the other part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), doesn't have any \\(a\\) or \\(b\\) terms. So, when you multiply them, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part will be multiplied by every term in the second part, each of which is a power of \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product will be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nWait, but the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, actually, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be present in the product as \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by each term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) will be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nBut wait, the sum of all coefficients in a polynomial is found by setting all variables to 1. So, for \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the sum of coefficients would be \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 * 64 = 384. But I'm not sure if that's correct because the problem might be expecting just the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and the rest is separate. Wait, no, because the entire expression is the product of both expansions, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would indeed be 6 times the sum of coefficients from the second part, which is 64, giving 384.\n\nWait, but let me check that again. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the first part, and when you multiply it by each term in the second part, each of those terms will have their own coefficients. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nBut wait, another way to think about it is that each term in the product is a combination of a term from the first expansion and a term from the second. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 (from the first part) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which is indeed 64. So, 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should think about the entire expansion. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and when you multiply by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which expands to a sum of terms with various powers of \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be 6 times the sum of the coefficients of all terms in the second expansion. Since the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is when \\(c = 1\\), so \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\), so 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because sometimes when you multiply polynomials, the coefficients don't just add up like that. Let me think again. Each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), so the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by every term in the second part, each of which has a coefficient. So, the total coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would indeed be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just 6 times the entire expansion of the second part, which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. That seems correct.\n\nWait, but let me confirm. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is:\n\n\\[\n\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n\\]\n\nSo, each term has a coefficient \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}\\) and a power of \\(c\\). When we multiply this by \\(a^2b^2\\), which has a coefficient of 6, the total coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. The sum of the coefficients in the second expansion is when \\(c = 1\\), so \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. When multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is \\(2^6 = 64\\), the total coefficient is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{384}\n\\]"

Maybe I don't need to expand everything.

Wait, but actually, when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first polynomial gets multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), that term in the first part is \\(6a^2b^2\\). So, when I multiply this by the second part, which is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the entire expression becomes \\(6a^2b^2 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nBut wait, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\).

So, the sum of the coefficients is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). Is that correct?\n\nWait, but that seems too straightforward. Let me think again. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times any power of \\(c\\), so the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, not a single number. Hmm, but the problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", which suggests a numerical coefficient, so maybe I'm supposed to consider all the terms and just take the coefficient in front of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. But that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion, which is a polynomial, so I think that's not the case.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me try another approach. Let me consider the entire expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) and think about how to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, in the expansion, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first part, which is \\((a + b)^4\\), and when multiplied by any term from the second part, which is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the entire second part, because when you multiply, each term in the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be \\(6 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that's a polynomial, not a number. So, perhaps the problem is expecting just the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, but that seems unlikely because the second part is also a polynomial.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable. So, the coefficient would be \\(6 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that's a polynomial, so perhaps the problem is expecting just the coefficient from the first part, 6, but that doesn't make sense because the second part affects the overall coefficient.\n\nWait, maybe I should expand both parts and then look for the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by a term from the second expansion. But that seems tedious. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would be \\(6\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which would give a coefficient that's a polynomial in \\(c\\). But since the problem doesn't specify any power of \\(c\\), I think that's not the case.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). In other words, the coefficient would be \\(6 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that's a polynomial, so perhaps the problem is expecting just the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, but that seems too simple.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm making a mistake here. Let me think differently. The expression is a product of two polynomials, so when you multiply them, each term in the first polynomial multiplies each term in the second polynomial. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part, which is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the entire second part, which is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient would be \\(6 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that's a polynomial, so perhaps the problem is expecting a numerical coefficient, which would only make sense if we're considering specific terms in the second expansion as well.\n\nWait, maybe I misread the problem. Perhaps it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where the powers of \\(c\\) cancel out. That would make sense because then the coefficient would be a number. Let me check the problem again: it just says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", so I'm not sure. Hmm, maybe I should proceed under the assumption that the problem wants the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), so the coefficient would be \\(6 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems odd because the coefficient is a polynomial, not a number.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to consider that in the product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term from the second expansion, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is \\(6 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that's a polynomial, so perhaps the problem is expecting a numerical coefficient, which would only be possible if the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by a constant term from the second expansion. So, let me check that.\n\nIn the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the constant term (where the power of \\(c\\) is zero) can be found using the binomial theorem. The general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). To find the term where the exponent is zero, we set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nWait, that makes sense. So, the problem is likely asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), which is the constant term. So, the coefficient is 120. Let me verify that again.\n\nFirst, the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) gives \\(6a^2b^2\\). Then, the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) has a constant term when \\(k = 3\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, multiplying these together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by 20 from the second part, giving \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\) as the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). So, the coefficient is 120.\n\nWait, but the problem didn't specify \\(c^0\\), so maybe I'm assuming too much. Let me see if the problem is indeed asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). If that's the case, then the coefficient would be \\(6 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial. But that seems unlikely because the problem probably expects a numerical answer. Therefore, I think the intended interpretation is that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nWait, but to be thorough, let me consider both interpretations. If the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), then the coefficient is \\(6 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial. But since the problem is presented in a way that expects a numerical answer, I think the intended question is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nLet me double-check my calculations. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is indeed 6. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). The term where the exponent is zero is when \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), so \\(k = 3\\). The coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, I think the answer is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6. Then, we find the constant term (where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20. Multiplying these together gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n$\\boxed{120}$"

    "text": " \n\nExpanding \\((a + b)^4\\), the general term would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\\) where \\(k\\) goes from 0 to 4. So, the coefficients for each term would be:\n\n- When \\(k=0\\): \\(\\dbinom{4}{0} = 1\\), so the term is \\(a^4\\).\n- When \\(k=1\\): \\(\\dbinom{4}{1} = 4\\), so the term is \\(4a^3b\\).\n- When \\(k=2\\): \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\), so the term is \\(6a^2b^2\\).\n- When \\(k=3\\): \\(\\dbinom{4}{3} = 4\\), so the term is \\(4ab^3\\).\n- When \\(k=4\\): \\(\\dbinom{4}{4} = 1\\), so the term is \\(b^4\\).\n\nSo, from this expansion, I see that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. But wait, the problem isn't just \\((a + b)^4\\), it's multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I need to consider how this multiplication affects the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). \n\nI think what's happening here is that each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is being multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) don't appear in the second part of the expression, which involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) won't be affected by the multiplication with the second expression. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression should just be the same as in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\), right?\n\nWait, but hold on a second. Let me make sure I'm not missing anything. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are only present in the first part, and \\(c\\) is only in the second part, when we multiply the two expressions together, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). However, since we're looking for just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\), does that mean we're considering all the terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any term from the second expansion?\n\nWait, but that doesn't make sense because \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term in the first expansion, and when we multiply it by the entire second expansion, it will create terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), and so on, each multiplied by their respective coefficients. However, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\). So, perhaps I'm misinterpreting the problem. Maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, but since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), the only way \\(a^2b^2\\) can appear is if it's multiplied by a term that is \\(c^0\\), i.e., a constant term. So, perhaps I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion, and then multiply them together.\n\nWait, that might be it. So, in other words, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because when you multiply the two expressions, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term from the second part, but only the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero will contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. All other terms would have some power of \\(c\\), so they wouldn't be part of \\(a^2b^2\\) alone.\n\nSo, let me confirm this approach. If I have two expressions, one in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the other in \\(c\\), then when I multiply them together, the variables are independent. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expression and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expression. So, I think this is the right way to approach it.\n\nTherefore, I need to find two things:\n\n1. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which I already found as 6.\n\n2. The coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nThen, I can multiply these two coefficients together to get the final coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product.\n\nSo, let's tackle the second part: finding the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nAgain, I can use the binomial theorem for this. The expression \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) can be expanded as \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k\\).\n\nSimplifying each term, that becomes \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} c^{-k} = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\).\n\nSo, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\), and we want the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, i.e., \\(6 - 2k = 0\\).\n\nSolving for \\(k\\): \\(6 - 2k = 0\\) implies \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\).\n\nTherefore, the term where \\(k=3\\) is the constant term, and its coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\).\n\nCalculating \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3! \\cdot 3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\cdot 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\).\n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20.\n\nNow, going back to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expression is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nWait, but let me just make sure I didn't make a mistake here. Sometimes when dealing with exponents, it's easy to mix up the terms.\n\nSo, in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term with \\(c^0\\) occurs when the exponents from \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) cancel each other out. So, when we have \\(c^{6 - k}\\) times \\(c^{-k}\\), which is \\(c^{6 - 2k}\\). Setting that equal to zero gives \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), so \\(k=3\\). That seems correct.\n\nAnd the binomial coefficient \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\) is indeed 20. So, that part checks out.\n\nSimilarly, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\), which is correct.\n\nTherefore, multiplying these together gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). So, I think that's the right answer.\n\nBut wait, just to make sure, let me think about it another way. If I were to multiply the two expansions together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part would be multiplied by every term in the second expansion. However, since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the powers of \\(c\\), does that mean we're considering all possible terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any power of \\(c\\)? But no, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which implies that it's looking for the coefficient when the term is just \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms. Therefore, it's only the term where the second factor contributes a \\(c^0\\), so that when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), it remains \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, my initial approach is correct.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem had asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some \\(k\\), then I would have to consider the corresponding terms. But since it's just \\(a^2b^2\\), it must be multiplied by \\(c^0\\). So, yeah, I think 120 is the correct answer.\n\nJust to recap:\n\n1. Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is 6.\n\n2. Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\), which is 20.\n\n3. Multiply these coefficients together to get 120.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem for both parts of the expression.\n\nFirst, we expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n\\]\nThe term involving \\(a^2b^2\\) occurs when \\(k = 2\\):\n\\[\n\\dbinom{4}{2} a^{2}b^{2} = 6a^2b^2\n\\]\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\nNext, we expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem:\n\\[\n\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n\\]\nWe need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero:\n\\[\n6 - 2k = 0 \\implies k = 3\n\\]\nThe coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is given by:\n\\[\n\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\n\\]\n\nFinally, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the product of the coefficients from each expansion:\n\\[\n6 \\times 20 = 120\n\\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

But wait, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). That means I need to consider how this term interacts with the second part of the expression, which is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nHmm, so when I multiply two expressions together, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression. But since I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I can consider that term separately. That is, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) from \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by every term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). However, since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product will just be \\(6\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nWait, is that right? Let me think again. Actually, when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum of the products of coefficients of terms that combine to form that specific term. But in this case, since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\) or its reciprocal, any term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) will result in a term that has \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by some power of \\(c\\). However, if the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\), then perhaps we're supposed to consider all possible coefficients where \\(a^2b^2\\) appears, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. \n\nBut wait, actually, no. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). That is, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by whatever terms come from the second expression. However, since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term in the first expression, when we multiply it by each term in the second expression, it will create terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2c^{-k}\\), where \\(k\\) is some integer. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, that's confusing because \\(a^2b^2\\) isn't a term that would appear on its own unless multiplied by a term that is 1 in the second expression. But \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) doesn't have a constant term. Let me check that.\n\nLet me expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem as well. So,\n\n\\[\n\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n\\]\n\nSo, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). Now, the exponents of \\(c\\) can be found by plugging in different \\(k\\) values. For \\(k = 0\\), we get \\(c^6\\), for \\(k = 1\\), we get \\(c^{4}\\), \\(k=2\\), \\(c^2\\), \\(k=3\\), \\(c^0 = 1\\), \\(k=4\\), \\(c^{-2}\\), \\(k=5\\), \\(c^{-4}\\), \\(k=6\\), \\(c^{-6}\\). So, the constant term is when \\(k=3\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} c^0 = 20\\). \n\nSo, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), that would come from multiplying \\(6a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion. But since the problem doesn't specify any particular power of \\(c\\), I think I might have misread the problem. Wait, no, actually, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), \\(a^2b^2c^2\\), \\(a^2b^2\\), \\(a^2b^2c^{-2}\\), etc. However, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is the term where the exponents of \\(c\\) are zero. That is, the constant term in the second expansion. \n\nSo, to clarify, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) from the second part. Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by the constant term, you get \\(a^2b^2 \\times 20\\), which is the term \\(20a^2b^2\\). If you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by any other term in the second expansion, you'll get a term with a power of \\(c\\), which isn't part of \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the only contribution to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is from the constant term in the second expansion. \n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part is 20. Therefore, the overall coefficient is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). \n\nWait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake here. So, the first part gives me \\(6a^2b^2\\), and the second part gives me a constant term of 20. So when I multiply these together, I get \\(6 \\times 20 a^2b^2 = 120a^2b^2\\). So yes, the coefficient is 120. \n\nBut just to double-check, let me consider the entire expansion. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first part, and when multiplied by each term in the second part, it will create terms with different powers of \\(c\\). However, the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would only be the case when the second factor contributes a constant term. So, only the term where the second part is 20 contributes to \\(a^2b^2\\). All other terms would have \\(c\\) raised to some power, so they wouldn't be part of \\(a^2b^2\\). \n\nTherefore, I think my reasoning is correct. The coefficient is 120. \n\nWait, but just to be thorough, let me consider another approach. Suppose I consider the entire expansion as a product of two polynomials. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the sum of the products of coefficients from each polynomial whose variables multiply to give \\(a^2b^2\\). But since the second polynomial only has variables \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), which don't interact with \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is simply the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial and the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial. Wait, no, that's not quite right because the second polynomial doesn't have a constant term unless we consider the entire expansion. \n\nWait, no, actually, the second polynomial is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which when expanded, has terms with various powers of \\(c\\). However, when you multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), each term in the second polynomial will create a term like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) where \\(k\\) is an even integer from -6 to 6. But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), that might not make sense because \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term on its own only when multiplied by \\(c^0\\). \n\nWait, no, actually, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\). So, in the product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would only come from multiplying the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first polynomial by the constant term in the second polynomial. Because any other term in the second polynomial would introduce a \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\) factor, which would make the term \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), not just \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the only way to get a term with \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) is to multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by the constant term in the second polynomial. \n\nSo, the constant term in the second polynomial is 20, as I calculated earlier. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). \n\nI think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in this reasoning. So, the final answer should be 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is found by multiplying the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) and the constant term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\n1. Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is 6.\n2. Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) to find the constant term, which is 20.\n3. Multiply these coefficients: \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\boxed{120}"

    "text": " \n\nSo, expanding \\((a + b)^4\\), the general term would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\\) for \\(k = 0\\) to \\(4\\). I need the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which means I need the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2. So, in the expansion, that would correspond to \\(k = 2\\), because \\(4 - k = 2\\) implies \\(k = 2\\). So, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). \n\nLet me compute that: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient from the \\((a + b)^4\\) part is 6. \n\nNow, the second part of the expression is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I'm supposed to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but this part involves \\(c\\). Wait, but the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, so maybe I don't need to worry about the \\(c\\) terms because \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables. So, perhaps the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nWait, but that doesn't seem right because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product of both expressions. But since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are only in the first part, and \\(c\\) is only in the second part, maybe the variables are independent, so when you multiply them, the \\(c\\) terms won't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. So, perhaps the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion, which doesn't make sense because we're looking for a specific coefficient, not an expression. \n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, perhaps the question is considering the entire product as a single expression and looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. That is, when you expand the entire product, the terms involving \\(c\\) would be multiplied by the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. But since we're only interested in the \\(a^2b^2\\) term, perhaps we can ignore the \\(c\\) terms because they don't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) exponents. \n\nWait, but that might not be the case. Because when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part would be multiplied by every term in the second part. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. But that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which doesn't make sense because we're looking for a numerical coefficient, not an expression involving \\(c\\). \n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion of the product, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. But that doesn't quite make sense because \\(c\\) is a separate variable. Alternatively, maybe the problem is written incorrectly, and it's supposed to be \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) and we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where \\(c\\) cancels out. That is, the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. So, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), which would be the constant term with respect to \\(c\\). \n\nThat makes more sense. So, the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\) in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, first, I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which we found to be 6. Then, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Then, the total coefficient would be 6 multiplied by that coefficient. \n\nOkay, so let's work on \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem again, the expansion is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying each term, that becomes \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m} = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). \n\nWe need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, so we set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). \n\nCalculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). \n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. \n\nNow, going back to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Therefore, when we multiply the two expansions together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake here. So, when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each polynomial, provided that the exponents add up appropriately. In this case, since we're looking for \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), which is independent of \\(c\\), we can consider the coefficients separately because the variables are independent. So, yes, the coefficient would be 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nAlternatively, if we think of the entire expansion, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part (with coefficient 6) is multiplied by every term in the second part, but only the term with \\(c^0\\) (coefficient 20) will contribute to the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. All other terms would have some power of \\(c\\), so they wouldn't contribute to the \\(a^2b^2\\) term when considering only \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). \n\nWait, but actually, the problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\" in the entire product. But in the product, each term is a combination of \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by some combination of \\(c\\) terms. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which I think refers to the coefficient when considering all possible \\(c\\) terms. But that doesn't make sense because \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by various powers of \\(c\\). \n\nWait, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present and the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. That would make sense because otherwise, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be a polynomial in \\(c\\), which isn't what is being asked. So, I think that's the correct interpretation. \n\nTherefore, the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nLet me just recap to make sure I didn't miss anything. \n\n1. Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n\n2. Expand \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem. The term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero is when \\(m = 3\\), giving \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n\n3. Multiply these two coefficients together: 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is 120, which is the answer we're looking for. \n\nI think that makes sense. I don't see any mistakes in the calculations. So, I'm confident that the coefficient is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then finding the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20. Multiplying these together gives 6 * 20 = 120.\n\n\\boxed{120}"

Calculating the coefficients, that would be \\(1a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + 1b^4\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in this part is 6. \n\nBut wait, the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I need to consider that as well. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is part of the first binomial expansion, but since the entire expression is multiplied by the second binomial, I might have to look at the entire product. However, \\(a^2b^2\\) is only from the first part, and the second part involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). Since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) don't appear in the second part, their coefficients won't be affected by the terms involving \\(c\\). So, maybe the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just 6 times whatever the coefficient of 1 is in the second part, because we're looking for \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. \n\nWait, but that doesn't seem right. Because when you multiply two expressions together, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression.

But since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the only term in the second part that would contribute to a term without \\(c\\) is the constant term, if any.

If I can find that, then I can multiply it by 6 to get the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression.\n\nSo, let's work on finding the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Again, using the binomial theorem: \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k\\).

So, set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), and solve for \\(k\\): \\(6 = 2k\\) so \\(k = 3\\). So, the constant term is when \\(k = 3\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} c^{0} = 20 \\times 1 = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (the constant term from the second part), which is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). \n\nWait, let me double-check that. So, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, correct. In \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the constant term is when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, which occurs at \\(k = 3\\), and the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, when we multiply the two expressions together, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second.

Or is it that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the entire second expansion?

But that can't be, because the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would actually be 6 multiplied by each term in the second expansion. Hmm, but I think I'm confusing the concepts here.\n\nWait, maybe I should think of the entire product as a product of two polynomials. So, when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficients of the terms in the product are obtained by convolving the coefficients of the two polynomials. But in this case, the two polynomials are in different variables: one is in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the other is in \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, when you multiply them, the variables are independent, so the coefficients of terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) would just be multiplied by the entire second polynomial.

But the question is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so maybe it's just 6, because the other part is in terms of \\(c\\).

So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6, and when you multiply by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in that expansion will multiply with 6, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times each term in the second expansion. But since the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), perhaps it's just 6, because the other part is in terms of \\(c\\), which is a different variable.

But again, that seems like the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't seem right.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, considering that the entire expression is a product, so the coefficient would be 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But perhaps the problem expects a numerical coefficient, so maybe I need to evaluate \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) and then multiply by 6. But that would give me a polynomial in \\(c\\), and the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would still be a polynomial in \\(c\\).\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try to think of it as two separate expansions. The first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), has the term \\(6a^2b^2\\). The second part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), is another expansion. When you multiply these two, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will have coefficients that are 6 times each term in the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that seems to be the case.\n\nWait, but the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, perhaps the answer is 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which seems unusual. Alternatively, maybe the problem is expecting me to consider that the variables \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\), and \\(1/c\\) are all separate, and so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be 6, because the other terms are in \\(c\\). But that doesn't seem right because when you multiply, the coefficients do get multiplied.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is expecting me to consider that the entire expression is a product, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would make the coefficient a polynomial in \\(c\\), which is not a constant. So, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is expecting me to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times some specific power of \\(c\\), but it's not specified. So, perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), which would be 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But I'm not sure.\n\nWait, maybe I should think of the entire product as a product of two polynomials, and when you multiply them, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the entire second polynomial. So, the coefficient is 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that seems to be the case.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting me to recognize that the variables are independent, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be 6, and the rest is part of the term involving \\(c\\). But that doesn't seem right because when you multiply, the coefficients do get multiplied.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider that the problem is written as \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), and it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, in the product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), so the coefficient would be 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that seems to be the case.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting me to consider that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just 6, and the rest is part of the term involving \\(c\\). But that seems inconsistent because when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficients multiply.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me try to think differently. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. So, in the product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times each term in the second expansion. But since the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), perhaps it's expecting the entire expansion, so 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\).\n\nWait, but that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which seems unusual. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting me to recognize that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion. But that doesn't seem right either.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is expecting me to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), i.e., the constant term in \\(c\\). So, that would mean I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times the constant term of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, first, I find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then I find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Then, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\) would be 6 times that constant term.\n\nLet me try that approach. So, first, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. Now, I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). To find the constant term, I can use the binomial theorem again. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(1/c\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, the exponent of \\(c\\) in each term is \\(6 - 2k\\). We need the term where the exponent is 0, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\). So, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\) is 6 times 20, which is 120.\n\nWait, but the problem didn't specify the power of \\(c\\), so maybe it's expecting the coefficient regardless of the power of \\(c\\), which would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that seems too much. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting me to consider that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion. But the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, 6 times 64 is 384. But that seems like a different approach.\n\nWait, I'm getting confused. Let me try to clarify. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, when we multiply these two expressions, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient is 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem is just asking for the coefficient, so maybe it's expecting the entire expression, which is 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\).\n\nBut that seems a bit odd because coefficients are usually constants, not expressions in variables. So, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Alternatively, maybe the problem is expecting me to consider that the coefficient is just 6, and the rest is part of the term involving \\(c\\). But that doesn't seem right because when you multiply, the coefficients do get multiplied.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^k\\) for some \\(k\\), but it's not specified. So, perhaps the answer is 6 times the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\). But that seems to be the case.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is expecting me to consider that the variables \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\), and \\(1/c\\) are separate, and so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be 6, and the rest is part of the term involving \\(c\\). But that seems inconsistent with how polynomial multiplication works.\n\nWait, perhaps I should think of the entire expression as a product, and the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which is 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\).

So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times each term in the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient is 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\).\n\nBut I'm not sure if that's the correct interpretation. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting me to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), which would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that seems to be the case.\n\nWait, but let me think differently. Suppose I want to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. So, in the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient is 6. Now, when I multiply by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in that expansion will be multiplied by 6. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will have a coefficient that is 6 times each term in the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\).\n\nBut that seems to be the case. So, perhaps the answer is 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient, so maybe it's expecting a numerical value. But since \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) expands to a polynomial, the coefficient would be a polynomial, not a number.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), i.e., the constant term in \\(c\\). So, in that case, I would need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and then multiply it by the constant term in the second part, which is 20, as I calculated earlier. So, 6 times 20 is 120. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) would be 120.\n\nBut the problem didn't specify the power of \\(c\\), so maybe it's expecting the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), which would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\).

But that seems inconsistent with polynomial multiplication.\n\nWait, maybe I should think of the entire product as a single polynomial, and the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which is 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that seems to be the case.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting me to consider that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion. The sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, 6 times 64 is 384. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 384. But that seems like a different interpretation.\n\nWait, but the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not \\(a^2b^2\\) times any specific power of \\(c\\).

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting me to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), which would be 6 times the constant term in the second expansion, which is 20, so 6 times 20 is 120. That seems plausible.\n\nWait, but the problem didn't specify the power of \\(c\\), so maybe it's expecting the coefficient regardless of \\(c\\), which would be 6 times the entire expansion. But that seems too much. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting me to recognize that the coefficient is 6 times the expansion, so the answer is \\(6\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\).\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting me to consider that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just 6, and the rest is part of the term involving \\(c\\). But that seems inconsistent with polynomial multiplication.\n\nWait, perhaps I should think of the problem as follows: The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the coefficient of 1 in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Wait, but the coefficient of 1 in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is the constant term, which is 20, as I calculated earlier. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times 20, which is 120.\n\nWait, that seems plausible. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the constant term in the second expansion, which is 20, so 6 times 20 is 120. So, the coefficient is 120.\n\nBut wait, why is that the case? Because when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each polynomial. So, if you're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is 6 in the first polynomial, and you want the term where \\(c\\) is raised to 0, which is 20 in the second polynomial, then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is 6 times 20, which is 120.\n\nBut the problem didn't specify the power of \\(c\\), so maybe it's expecting the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), which would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that seems too involved, and I think the problem is expecting a numerical coefficient.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), which is 120. Alternatively, maybe the problem is expecting me to consider that the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion, but that seems unlikely.\n\nWait, let me check an example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^2 (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, the expansion of \\((a + b)^2\\) is \\(a^2 + 2ab + b^2\\). The expansion of \\((c + 1/c)\\) is \\(c + 1/c\\). Now, the product is \\(a^2(c + 1/c) + 2ab(c + 1/c) + b^2(c + 1/c)\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in this product would be zero because there's no \\(a^2b^2\\) term. Wait, that's a different case because in the product, each term is a product of terms from each expansion, so \\(a^2\\) times \\(c\\) is \\(a^2c\\), which is a different term. So, in this case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would indeed be zero because there's no combination of terms that gives \\(a^2b^2\\).\n\nWait, but in our original problem, we have \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first expansion, and when multiplied by terms from the second expansion, it gives terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times each term in the second expansion. But since the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), perhaps it's expecting the coefficient regardless of the power of \\(c\\), which would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\).\n\nBut in the example I just thought of, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be zero because there's no such term. So, perhaps in our original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which would mean that the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But that seems unusual because coefficients are usually constants.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think differently. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. So, in the product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times each term in the second expansion. So, the coefficient is 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\).\n\nBut that seems to be the case. So, the answer is \\(6\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But perhaps the problem is expecting me to expand it further. Let me try that.\n\nFirst, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) can be expanded using the binomial theorem as \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(1/c\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, the expansion is:\n\n- \\(k=0\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{0}c^6 = 1 \\cdot c^6 = c^6\\)\n- \\(k=1\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{1}c^4 = 6c^4\\)\n- \\(k=2\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{2}c^2 = 15c^2\\)\n- \\(k=3\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}c^0 = 20\\)\n- \\(k=4\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{4}c^{-2} = 15c^{-2}\\)\n- \\(k=5\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{5}c^{-4} = 6c^{-4}\\)\n- \\(k=6\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{6}c^{-6} = c^{-6}\\)\n\nSo, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15c^{-2} + 6c^{-4} + c^{-6}\\).\n\nTherefore, multiplying by 6, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is:\n\n\\(6c^6 + 36c^4 + 90c^2 + 120 + 90c^{-2} + 36c^{-4} + 6c^{-6}\\).\n\nBut that seems too involved, and I think the problem is expecting a numerical coefficient, not a polynomial. So, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), which is the constant term. So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times 20, which is 120.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting me to consider that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just 6, and the rest is part of the term involving \\("

So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in this part is 6. Now, the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Hmm, so I need to consider the entire product. But wait, the problem only asks for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). That means I don't need to worry about the terms involving \\(c\\) because they won't affect the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. So, maybe I can just take the coefficient from the first part and multiply it by whatever the entire second part is? Wait, no, that's not right because the second part is raised to the 6th power, so it's also a binomial expansion. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), perhaps the terms involving \\(c\\) don't matter because we're only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, maybe the coefficient is just 6 times the entire expansion of the second part? But that doesn't make sense because the coefficient should be a number, not an expression. Wait, perhaps I need to consider that when multiplying the two expansions, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part will be multiplied by every term from the second expansion, but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), the terms involving \\(c\\) can be anything because they don't affect the power of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would just be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in the second expansion. But wait, no, because when you multiply two expressions, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire second part, but that doesn't seem right. Maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again. Since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and the other part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), maybe the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part, but since we're only interested in the coefficient, not the variable part, perhaps it's just 6 times the sum of the coefficients of the second expansion. Wait, but the sum of the coefficients in a binomial expansion is found by setting all variables to 1. So, for \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), if we set \\(c = 1\\), we get \\((1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 times 64, which is 384. But wait, that seems too straightforward. Let me check again. Alternatively, maybe I should consider that when multiplying two polynomials, the coefficients multiply. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6, and the coefficient of any term in the second part is whatever it is, but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and the second part doesn't have \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), the only term that affects \\(a^2b^2\\) is the constant term from the second expansion, because if you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by any term in the second expansion, it would introduce \\(c\\) terms, but the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be 6 times the constant term in the second expansion. Wait, that makes sense. So, in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the constant term is the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. Let me find that. The general term in the expansion is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - k}\\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\\). We want the exponent of \\(c\\) to be zero, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\). So, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 times 20, which is 120. Hmm, so earlier I thought it was 384, but now I think it's 120. Which one is correct? Let me think again. When you have two polynomials multiplied together, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum of the products of the coefficients of terms whose variables multiply to give that specific term. In this case, we're looking for \\(a^2b^2\\). The first polynomial has \\(a^2b^2\\) with coefficient 6, and the second polynomial has a constant term 20. When you multiply them, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first polynomial is multiplied by the constant term 20 from the second polynomial, resulting in 6 * 20 = 120. So, that should be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression. Therefore, the answer is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression is found by first expanding \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem, identifying the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) as 6. Next, we consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) and find its constant term, which is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying these coefficients together gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{120}\n\\]"

    "text": " \n\nWait, but actually, I don't need to expand the entire expression because the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, maybe I can just find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and then multiply it by the entire second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), since the second part doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\). That makes sense because the terms in the second part only involve \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), so they won't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. \n\nSo, first, let me find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\). Using the binomial theorem, the coefficient is given by \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}\\), where \\(k\\) is the exponent of \\(b\\). Since we want \\(a^2b^2\\), that means \\(k = 2\\). So, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Let me calculate that: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\nNow, since the other part of the expression is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), and we don't care about the coefficients involving \\(c\\), we can treat this entire part as a constant when considering the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, actually, no. Because the problem is asking for the coefficient in the entire product. So, perhaps I need to consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) as well, but only in terms of how it affects the coefficient when multiplied by the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. \n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think again. The expression is \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When I expand both parts, each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by every term in the second expansion. But since we are only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficients from the second expansion will just scale the coefficient from the first part. \n\nWait, no, that's not quite right. Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), you'll get terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2c^{-k}\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would be the term where the powers of \\(c\\) cancel out, i.e., when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part. \n\nAh, that makes sense. So, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is the constant term, and then multiply it by the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part, which we found to be 6. \n\nSo, let me find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Again, using the binomial theorem, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). \n\nWe want the exponent of \\(c\\) to be zero, so we set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20.\n\nNow, since the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is multiplied by the constant term 20 from the second part, the overall coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the second part). So, 6 times 20 is 120.\n\nWait, let me double-check that. The first coefficient is 6, and the second coefficient is 20. Multiplying them gives 120. So, yes, that should be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of the entire expression as a product of two separate expansions. When I multiply the two expansions together, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion will be multiplied by every term in the second expansion, but only the term with \\(c^0\\) will contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the final product. All other terms will have some power of \\(c\\) and won't be part of the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. Therefore, the coefficient is indeed 6 times 20, which is 120.\n\nI think that makes sense. Let me just recap to make sure I didn't make a mistake. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 20. Multiplying these together gives 120. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is found using the binomial coefficient \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). The coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying these together gives the final coefficient as \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\boxed{120}"

So, the expansion is \\(a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). \n\nNow, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which in this expansion is 6. But wait, the original expression isn't just \\((a + b)^4\\); it's multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I need to consider that when I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). \n\nLet me think about this. Since the two parts of the expression are multiplied together, the terms will multiply term by term. But I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which comes from the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\). The other part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), will contribute some terms, but since I'm looking for \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\), I might need to consider how the multiplication affects the coefficient. \n\nWait, actually, no. Because when you multiply two polynomials, each term from the first polynomial is multiplied by each term from the second polynomial. But since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) don't appear in the second polynomial, the only way \\(a^2b^2\\) can appear in the product is if it's multiplied by a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\). But \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is a polynomial in \\(c\\), so when we multiply by \\((a + b)^4\\), each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nBut wait, that means the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), so to get the total coefficient, we multiply 6 by the sum of the coefficients in the second expression. \n\nBut hold on, is that correct? Let me make sure. The total product is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by every term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nBut wait, what's the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)? To find the sum of the coefficients, we can set \\(c = 1\\). So, substituting \\(c = 1\\), we get \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). \n\nWait, but let me think again. Is that the case? Because when we set \\(c = 1\\), we are indeed summing all the coefficients, but in the original problem, we are looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\). So, when we multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each of these will contribute a multiple of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2 \\times c^{-k}\\), but since we are only interested in \\(a^2b^2\\), which has no \\(c\\) terms, we need to find the terms in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) that are constants, i.e., the terms where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. \n\nAh, so I was wrong before. I thought it was the sum of all coefficients, but actually, it's only the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) that, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), gives a term without \\(c\\). So, I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) and then multiply it by 6 to get the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). \n\nOkay, so let's correct that. First, find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be zero, so set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). \n\nSo, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} c^{0} = \\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, the constant term is 20. \n\nNow, going back to the original product, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the constant term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). As we found earlier, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the constant term in the other expression is 20. Therefore, the total coefficient is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). \n\nWait, but hold on a second. Let me make sure I didn't make a mistake here. So, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6, and in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the constant term is 20. So, when you multiply these two, you get \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120. \n\nLet me just check if this makes sense. Another way to think about it is to consider that each term in the product will be of the form \\(a^{4 - k}b^{k}c^{6 - m}(1/c)^m = a^{4 - k}b^{k}c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, to get a term without \\(c\\), we need \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which gives \\(m = 3\\), as before. So, the term is \\(a^{4 - k}b^{k}\\). We are interested in \\(a^2b^2\\), so \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). \n\nTherefore, the coefficient comes from two parts: the binomial coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) when \\(k = 2\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\), and the binomial coefficient from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) when \\(m = 3\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying these together gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). \n\nYes, that seems correct. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120. \n\nI think that's the answer. Let me just recap to make sure I didn't skip any steps. First, I expanded \\((a + b)^4\\) and found the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. Then, I realized that since the expression is multiplied by another binomial \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), I need to find the constant term in that binomial because that's the only way \\(a^2b^2\\) will remain without any \\(c\\) terms. I calculated the constant term by setting the exponent of \\(c\\) to zero, which gave me \\(k = 3\\), and the coefficient is 20. Multiplying 6 and 20 gives 120. \n\nI don't think I made any mistakes here. So, I'm confident the coefficient is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplying it by the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20. Therefore, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\boxed{120}"

If I'm looking for \\(a^2b^2\\), then the term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) doesn't affect the power of \\(a\\) or \\(b\\). So, maybe I can compute the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) separately and then just take the entire coefficient from that expansion and multiply it by the 6 I found earlier from \\((a + b)^4\\). Wait, that might not be correct because the terms in the second expansion could have different coefficients that would contribute to the overall coefficient when multiplied by the 6. Alternatively, perhaps the terms from the second expansion don't affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) because \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) are separate variables. So, maybe the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, that might not be right either because each term in the second expansion is multiplied by each term in the first expansion. So, perhaps I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and then multiply it by the sum of all the coefficients in the second part. But wait, the sum of all coefficients in the second part is when \\(c = 1\\), so substituting \\(c = 1\\) into \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, then the total coefficient would be 6 * 64 = 384. But I'm not sure if that's correct because maybe I need to consider specific terms. Alternatively, maybe I should treat the two expansions separately and realize that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is independent of the \\(c\\) terms. So, the coefficient would just be 6 times whatever the coefficient is for the \\(c\\) terms, but since the \\(c\\) terms are separate, perhaps they all contribute. Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me try a different approach.\n\nWait, actually, the entire expression is a product of two independent binomial expansions. So, when you multiply them together, each term from the first expansion is multiplied by each term from the second expansion. However, since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), the terms from the second expansion don't affect the power of \\(a\\) or \\(b\\). Therefore, every term in the second expansion will just contribute a coefficient multiplier to the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Since the sum of coefficients in the second part is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the total coefficient would be 6 * 64 = 384. Hmm, that seems plausible, but let me verify.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should expand both parts separately and then multiply the specific terms. Let me try that. So, the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), has the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) as we found. The second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), can be expanded using the binomial theorem as \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\).

When we multiply the two expansions together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product will be \\(6 \\times \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m}\\). Wait, but that sum is \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\), so again, 6 * 64 = 384. So, that seems consistent. Therefore, the coefficient is 384. But wait, another thought: when we multiply the two polynomials, each term from the first is multiplied by each term from the second, but since the second polynomial's terms involve \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), they don't affect the powers of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed the product of the coefficient from the first part and the sum of all coefficients from the second part. So, 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not missing anything. Let me compute the sum of the coefficients in the second part again.

Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 * 64 = 384. So, I think that's the answer.\n\nWait, but let me check if I considered everything correctly. Another way to think about it is that when you have two independent expressions multiplied together, the coefficient of a specific term in one part is multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the other part because each term in the second part contributes to the coefficient when multiplied by the specific term in the first part. So, yeah, that makes sense.

So, in other words, when we expand the entire expression, any term that has \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by some power of \\(c\\) will contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and not worrying about the powers of \\(c\\), I think we can treat the two parts separately. That is, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, that might not be correct because each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is being multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is going to be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nWait, let me think again. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) is only from the first part, and when multiplied by any term from the second part, it will just add another factor involving \\(c\\). But since the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, I think that's not the case. Actually, no, the coefficient in the product is the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all coefficients from the second part, because each term from the second part will be multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), contributing to the coefficient. \n\nWait, maybe not. Let me clarify. When you have two polynomials multiplied together, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum of the products of the coefficients of terms whose variables multiply to give that specific term. In this case, since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), any term from the second polynomial, regardless of its \\(c\\) power, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), will result in a term that has \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by some power of \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which I think refers only to the coefficient when the term is \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms. But that can't be because the entire expression is multiplied by terms involving \\(c\\). So, actually, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in the second polynomial, so each of those will have a term like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2c^{-k}\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would actually be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the sum of all coefficients in the second part, because each term in the second part contributes a coefficient that gets multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). \n\nSo, the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\). Let me check that. If \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = (2)^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 64 (sum of coefficients from the second part), which is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but in the entire product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial, which includes different powers of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would actually be the coefficient from the first part times the sum of the coefficients from the second part, because each term in the second part contributes a coefficient that, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), gives a term that includes \\(a^2b^2\\) and some power of \\(c\\). But since the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then yes, we need to consider all those contributions. \n\nAlternatively, another way to think about it is that the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first polynomial will be multiplied by every term in the second polynomial, each of which has a coefficient. So, the total coefficient for all terms of the form \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) (where \\(k\\) can be any integer) is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because sometimes when you're asked for the coefficient of a specific term, you have to consider cross terms, but in this case, since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), and the second polynomial only involves \\(c\\), there's no overlap or cross terms that would affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, I think my initial approach is correct. The coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I should approach it differently. Let's consider the entire expansion of both polynomials. The first polynomial is \\((a + b)^4\\), which gives terms up to \\(a^4\\) and \\(b^4\\). The second polynomial is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which gives terms involving \\(c^6, c^4, c^2, c^0, c^{-2}, c^{-4}, c^{-6}\\). So, when we multiply these together, each term from the first polynomial is multiplied by each term from the second polynomial. Therefore, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first polynomial will be multiplied by each term in the second polynomial, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), etc. \n\nBut the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would be the sum of all coefficients from the second polynomial multiplied by the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first polynomial. Since the second polynomial's terms don't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) parts, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is indeed 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second polynomial. \n\nTo confirm, let's calculate the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). As I thought earlier, setting \\(c = 1\\) gives the sum of coefficients: \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). So, 6 * 64 is 384. \n\nWait, but another way to think about it is that when you have two polynomials multiplied together, the coefficient of a term in the product is the sum of the products of coefficients of terms that multiply to give that term. In this case, since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), any term in the second polynomial will multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term, and each such multiplication contributes to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for various \\(k\\). But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), we're essentially summing all these contributions. Therefore, the coefficient is indeed 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nAlternatively, if the problem had asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), that would be different, because then we would have to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second polynomial and multiply it by 6. But since it's just \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\), we need to consider all the coefficients from the second polynomial. \n\nWait, but let me check this again. Suppose I have two polynomials, P(a, b) and Q(c). Then, the product P(a, b) * Q(c) will have terms where each term in P is multiplied by each term in Q. So, the coefficient of a specific term in P, say \\(a^2b^2\\), in the product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in P multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in Q, because each term in Q contributes a coefficient that gets multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, yes, the coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nAlternatively, to make it more concrete, suppose I have P(a, b) = (a + b)^4 and Q(c) = (c + 1/c)^6. Then, the product is P(a, b) * Q(c). The term \\(a^2b^2\\) in P is 6a^2b^2. When multiplied by Q(c), each term in Q(c) is something like \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, when you multiply 6a^2b^2 by each of these terms, you get 6 * \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}\\) a^2b^2c^{6 - 2k}. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the sum over k of 6 * \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}\\), which is 6 * sum_{k=0}^6 \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}\\) = 6 * 2^6 = 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nYes, that makes sense. So, the coefficient is 384. \n\nWait, just to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the binomial coefficients. Let me verify the sum of coefficients in Q(c). The sum of coefficients in Q(c) is when c = 1, so (1 + 1/1)^6 = 2^6 = 64. So, that's correct. And the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in P(a, b) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) = 6. So, 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nI think that's solid. So, the coefficient is 384.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break down the problem as follows:\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n\n2. **Consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   The sum of all coefficients in this expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\):\n   \\[\n   \\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\n   \\]\n\n3. **Combine the results:**\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 64 = 384\n   \\]\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{384}\\)."

I'm specifically looking for the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2. That would be when \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). So, substituting \\(k = 2\\), the coefficient would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Let me calculate that: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6.\n\nWait, but the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I need to consider both parts. However, I'm only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is in the first part. The second part involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), so it doesn't affect the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). That means, when I multiply the two parts together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by every term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nBut wait, since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), maybe I don't need to worry about the other variables. So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would just be 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). However, I'm not sure if that's the case because the problem might be expecting a numerical coefficient, but since the other part involves \\(c\\), the term might actually be part of a larger expression. Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think again.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). That is, it's just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times whatever it is multiplied by in the second part. But actually, since the second part is a separate expression, when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by every term in the second part, each contributing a different power of \\(c\\). But the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so it's possible that it's considering the entire expression as a polynomial in \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\), and \\(1/c\\), and wants the coefficient of the specific term \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). \n\nWait, but that might not make sense because \\(a^2b^2\\) is just a part of the entire expression, and when multiplied by the second part, it would result in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2c^{-k}\\). So, perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without considering the \\(c\\) terms, meaning that the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of the second part. But that seems a bit odd because the coefficient would then be a polynomial in \\(c\\). Alternatively, maybe the problem is expecting the coefficient when considering all possible terms, but that doesn't seem right either.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misinterpreting the problem. Maybe it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which would be the product of the coefficient from the first part and the entire expansion of the second part. But that would mean the coefficient is 6 times the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem is just asking for a coefficient, so maybe I need to consider that the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term from the second expansion, so the coefficient for each term would be 6 times the corresponding binomial coefficient from the second expansion. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so perhaps it's just 6, as the other part doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. Wait, but that can't be right because the entire expression is a product, so the coefficients would multiply.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me try a different approach. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term comes only from the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\), which we found to have a coefficient of 6. The other part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), when expanded, will have terms like \\(c^6\\), \\(c^4\\), etc., but since we're multiplying the entire expansion of the second part by the first part, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of all the terms in the second expansion. But that would mean the coefficient is 6 times \\(2^6\\) because \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) evaluated at \\(c = 1\\) is \\(2^6 = 64\\). Wait, but that's not correct because the problem isn't evaluating at any specific value; it's just looking for the coefficient.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Maybe it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). That would mean that the coefficient is 6 multiplied by each term in the second expansion, so the coefficient for each term \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^k\\) in the second expansion. But the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which might imply that it's considering the entire expression as a product, and the coefficient is 6 times the expansion of the second part. But that would make the coefficient a polynomial in \\(c\\), which seems unlikely.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, considering all possible exponents of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients from the second expansion. Since the second expansion is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the sum of its coefficients is when \\(c = 1\\), which is \\(2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 * 64 = 384. But that seems too high, and I'm not sure if that's the right approach.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it again. Let me think differently. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), with coefficient 6. The second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), when expanded, has terms like \\(c^6\\), \\(6c^4\\), \\(15c^2\\), \\(20\\), \\(15c^{-2}\\), \\(6c^{-4}\\), \\(c^{-6}\\). But when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by this, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each of these terms, resulting in \\(6a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(6a^2b^2c^4\\), etc. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would actually be 6 times the entire expansion of the second part, meaning that the coefficient is 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. Therefore, perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and the second part is just multiplied as a whole, so the coefficient remains 6. But that seems too simple.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misinterpreting the problem. Perhaps it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, considering all possible exponents of \\(c\\). But that would mean the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 2^6 = 6 * 64 = 384. But I'm not sure if that's the correct interpretation.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), i.e., the term where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out. That would make more sense because then the coefficient would be a numerical value. So, to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is \\(a^2b^2\\), we need to consider the term where the exponents of \\(c\\) in the second expansion cancel out, i.e., the middle term where the exponent is 0. \n\nSo, let's try that approach. First, find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6. Then, find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). To find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\), we can use the binomial theorem. The general term in the expansion is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We want the exponent of \\(c\\) to be 0, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire product is 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the answer should be 120.\n\nWait, but let me double-check that. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first part with coefficient 6, and the term \\(c^0\\) comes from the second part with coefficient 20. When you multiply these two terms together, you get \\(6a^2b^2 * 20c^0 = 120a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 120.\n\nBut I'm a bit confused because earlier I thought maybe the problem was just asking for the coefficient in the first part, but now I'm considering that it's asking for the coefficient when multiplied by the term where \\(c\\) cancels out. I think that makes more sense because otherwise, the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't seem to be what the problem is asking for. So, I think the correct approach is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nLet me summarize:\n\n1. Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6.\n\n2. Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem. The coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n\n3.

Therefore, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\boxed{120}."

    "text": " \n\nWait, but actually, I don't need to expand the entire expression. I just need the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, maybe I can just find the term where \\(a\\) is squared and \\(b\\) is squared in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\). Let me recall the binomial theorem again. The general term is \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\\). So, I want the term where \\(a^2b^2\\), which means \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). So, the coefficient would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Let me calculate that. \n\n\\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. \n\nNow, the original expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the next part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Hmm, since I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which comes from the first part, and then multiplied by something from the second part. Wait, but actually, the second part doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\); it's only in terms of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, does that mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just 6 times whatever the constant term is in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)? Because when you multiply the two expressions, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, but I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so I think that term remains as is, and the rest of the terms from the second expansion will involve \\(c\\) terms, which won't affect the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. \n\nWait, no, that might not be right. Let me think again. When you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. So, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from \\((a + b)^4\\) is a single term, and when multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), it will produce terms like \\(6a^2b^2c^k\\) and \\(6a^2b^2 \\dfrac{1}{c^k}\\), etc. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so I think we're only concerned with the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, because that's the only term that will have \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms. So, in other words, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 multiplied by the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nSo, now I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me use the binomial theorem again. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, each term has an exponent of \\(c\\) equal to \\(6 - 2k\\). I need to find the term where the exponent is zero because that's the constant term. So, set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\). \n\nSo, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Let me compute that. \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20. \n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). \n\nWait, let me double-check that. So, the first part gives 6, the second part's constant term is 20, so 6 times 20 is indeed 120. Hmm, that seems right. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of it as the entire expression being the product of two independent expansions, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and the constant term in the second part. That makes sense because when you multiply, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part would be multiplied by each term in the second part, but only the constant term from the second part would result in a term that is just \\(a^2b^2\\), without any \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\) terms. \n\nSo, yes, I think 120 is the correct coefficient. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations. The binomial coefficients are correct: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\) and \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying them gives 120. \n\nI guess that's the answer then. \n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem.\n\nFirst, consider the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\). Using the binomial theorem, the term involving \\(a^2b^2\\) is given by:\n\\[\n\\binom{4}{2} a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\n\\]\nSo, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\nNext, we need to find the constant term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem, the general term is:\n\\[\n\\binom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\binom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n\\]\nWe need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, which occurs when \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(k = 3\\). The constant term is:\n\\[\n\\binom{6}{3} = 20\n\\]\n\nMultiplying the coefficient from the first expansion by the constant term from the second expansion gives:\n\\[\n6 \\times 20 = 120\n\\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

But wait, the problem isn't just \\((a + b)^4\\), it's multiplied by another expression: \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I need to consider how this affects the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). \n\nLet me think about this. The entire expression is a product of two binomials raised to powers. So, when you multiply two expressions, the coefficients multiply as well. But I need to be careful here because the second expression involves variables \\(c\\) and \\(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\), which are different from \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). So, perhaps the variables \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) don't interfere with the variables \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). That is, the terms involving \\(c\\) won't affect the \\(a^2b^2\\) term because they involve different variables. So, maybe I can treat the two parts separately. \n\nLet me break it down. The expression is \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\), and \\(1/c\\) are all different variables, the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are independent of those involving \\(c\\). Therefore, when I expand the entire expression, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, no, that doesn't make sense because when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. However, in this case, we're specifically looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Since the second part of the product doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), it's just a constant factor when considering the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. \n\nWait, maybe I should think of it as the product of two independent expansions. So, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) won't affect the terms involving \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't seem right because the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is a sum of terms with different powers of \\(c\\), which are separate from \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). So, when you multiply, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second, but since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient would actually be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nWait, but that doesn't seem correct either because the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) would be found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression equal to 6 * 64 = 384? That seems high. Let me check that again. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Since the term \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is simply the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But actually, no, because when you multiply two polynomials, each term from the first is multiplied by each term from the second. However, since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is to multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) from \\((a + b)^4\\) by the constant term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nWait, that makes more sense. So, the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. So, I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which would be the term where the power of \\(c\\) cancels out. \n\nLet me recall that the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is given by the binomial theorem as well:\n\n\\[\n\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n\\]\n\nSo, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We want the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, because that's the constant term. So, set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\):\n\n\\[\n6 - 2k = 0 \\implies 2k = 6 \\implies k = 3\n\\]\n\nSo, the constant term is when \\(k = 3\\), which is:\n\n\\[\n\\dbinom{6}{3} c^{0} = 20 \\cdot 1 = 20\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. \n\nNow, going back to the original problem. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, as we found earlier. When we multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. However, since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the only term in the second expansion that will contribute to \\(a^2b^2\\) is the constant term, which is 20. \n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). \n\nWait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake here. So, \\((a + b)^4\\) gives \\(a^2b^2\\) with coefficient 6, and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) has a constant term of 20. Since \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by all terms in the second expansion, but only the constant term will result in a term that's \\(a^2b^2\\) times 1 (i.e., not involving \\(c\\)). All other terms in the second expansion involve \\(c\\) to some power, so when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), they would result in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2/c^k\\), which are different from \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, only the constant term in the second expansion contributes to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. \n\nSo, yes, multiplying 6 by 20 gives 120. Therefore, the coefficient is 120.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). The general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\times (1/c)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, when \\(k = 3\\), it's \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} c^{0}\\), which is 20. So, that's correct. \n\nAnd in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). \n\nSo, putting it all together, the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nI think that makes sense. So, the final answer should be 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Multiplying these together gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{120}\n\\]"

    "text": " \n\nWait, but hold on, the second part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). That also looks like a binomial expression, so I can expand that as well using the binomial theorem. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Hmm, but the second part has \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), which are different variables. So, does that mean that the terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) don't affect the coefficients of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\)? Because \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\), and \\(1/c\\) are all different variables, right? So, maybe the coefficients of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the coefficient of the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because when you multiply two expressions, the coefficients multiply if the variables are the same. But here, since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are in one part, and \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) are in the other, the only way \\(a^2b^2\\) can appear in the product is if we take the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part and the constant term (which has no \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\)) from the second part. So, that makes sense. \n\nSo, first, let me find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\). Using the binomial theorem, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\), because the exponent on \\(a\\) is 2 and on \\(b\\) is 2, which adds up to 4. So, \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) is 6. Got that part. \n\nNow, I need to find the coefficient of the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because when I multiply the two expressions, the constant term from the second part will just multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part without introducing any new variables, so that's the term we need. \n\nTo find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), I can again use the binomial theorem. The expansion is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k\\). Simplifying each term, that's \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} c^{-k}\\) which is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). \n\nWe want the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, because that's the constant term. So, set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(6 = 2k\\) so \\(k = 3\\). \n\nTherefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\) which is 20. So, the coefficient of the constant term is 20. \n\nNow, to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, we multiply the coefficient from the first part by the coefficient from the second part. That is, 6 (from \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\)) multiplied by 20 (the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)). \n\nSo, 6 times 20 is 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is 120. \n\nWait, let me double-check my reasoning to make sure I didn't make a mistake. So, in the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). That seems correct. \n\nIn the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), I correctly identified that the constant term occurs when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, which happens when \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Then, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\), which is correct. \n\nMultiplying 6 and 20 gives 120, which seems right. So, I think I did this correctly. \n\nJust to make sure, maybe I can consider a simpler case or think about the entire expansion. Alternatively, maybe I can consider that the entire expression is the product of two independent expansions, so the coefficients multiply when the variables don't interfere. Since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\), and \\(1/c\\) are all separate, the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are independent of those involving \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is indeed the product of the coefficients of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and the constant term in the second part. \n\nSo, I think my answer is correct. The coefficient is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is found by multiplying the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) and the constant term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\n1.

But wait, that might not be exactly right. Because when you multiply, the terms combine, so the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the entire second part, but only if the second part doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. Hmm, actually, since the second part only involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), and the first part involves \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), when we multiply them, the variables \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are independent of \\(c\\).

Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating it.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some \\(k\\), but it's written as just \\(a^2b^2\\). Maybe the problem is only considering the coefficient in the context of the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms, treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable. So, perhaps the coefficient is just the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would make the coefficient a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the question is asking for a numerical coefficient. I'm confused now.\n\nWait, maybe I should consider that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in other words, the coefficient would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a number multiplied by a sum of numbers. Wait, no, the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is obtained by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of all coefficients is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by 64.\n\nWait, but let me check that. If I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = (1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times 64. So, first, let's find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\).\n\nUsing the binomial theorem, the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\\). So, the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) occurs is when \\(4 - k = 2\\), so \\(k = 2\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\nNow, as I thought earlier, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 64. Therefore, the coefficient would be \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). But wait, let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here.\n\nWait, another way to think about it is that when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum of the products of the coefficients of terms that multiply together to give that specific term. But in this case, since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are different variables, the terms in \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) don't interfere with each other in terms of variable exponents. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which means that the coefficient is indeed 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 64. So, 6 times 64 is 384. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 384.\n\nWait, but let me check this another way. Let's consider that the product is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, when you expand this, each term in the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by every term in the second part, which is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be \\(6 \\times\\) the sum of the coefficients of all terms in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is indeed 64. So, 6 times 64 is 384. Therefore, the coefficient is 384.\n\nAlternatively, if I wanted to be more precise, I could consider that the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is obtained by substituting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times 64, which is 384.\n\nWait, but maybe I'm missing something. Let me think again. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but in the product, \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by various powers of \\(c\\). So, actually, the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\), not a constant. But the problem is phrased as asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which suggests that it's considering all the terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) appears, regardless of the power of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient would indeed be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of the second polynomial. But since the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, perhaps it's considering the coefficient as a constant, independent of \\(c\\). But that doesn't make sense because the coefficient would involve \\(c\\) terms.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating it again. Let me try to think differently. Perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, considering only the terms where \\(c\\) is raised to a specific power, but the problem doesn't specify that. It just says \\(a^2b^2\\). So, perhaps the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, regardless of the power of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 64, so 6 times 64 is 384.\n\nWait, but another approach is to realize that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is equal to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient is 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would make the coefficient a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. Therefore, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\), which is 1. In that case, I would need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and multiply it by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). That makes more sense because then the coefficient would be a numerical value.\n\nSo, let's try that approach. First, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, as before. Now, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is the middle term when \\(c^0\\) is present. Using the binomial theorem, the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(1/c\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, we need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be 0, which occurs when \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, considering only the term where \\(c^0\\) is present, is 120.\n\nWait, but the problem didn't specify anything about \\(c\\), it just asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it again. Let me check the problem statement again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, the expression is a product of two polynomials, one in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and another in \\(c\\). Therefore, when you multiply them, the variables are independent. Therefore, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) can be combined with any term from the second polynomial, which is in \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of the second polynomial. But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which would be a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, so perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some \\(k\\), but it's written as \\(a^2b^2\\). Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the entire product and wants the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\). But in that case, the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the question is asking for a numerical coefficient. Therefore, perhaps the problem is only considering the coefficient from the first polynomial, \\((a + b)^4\\), and ignoring the second polynomial, which doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\). But that seems unlikely.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider that the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating \\(c\\) as a constant. But that doesn't make sense because \\(c\\) is a variable, not a constant. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, considering all possible powers of \\(c\\). But in that case, the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\), which isn't a numerical coefficient.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is mistyped, and it's supposed to be \\((a + b + c)^4\\), but no, it's written as \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, I have to work with that.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, the coefficient would be the sum of all coefficients of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for all \\(k\\), which would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). As I thought earlier, the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial is 64, so 6 times 64 is 384. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 384.\n\nWait, but let me confirm this approach. If I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = (1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, the product becomes \\((a + b)^4 \\times 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in this product is 64 times the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6. So, 64 times 6 is 384. Therefore, the coefficient is 384.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 384.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can proceed as follows:\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term containing \\(a^2b^2\\) occurs when \\(k = 2\\), so its coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n\n2. **Consider the second part \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   The sum of all coefficients in this expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\):\n   \\[\n   \\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\n   \\]\n\n3. **Combine the results:**\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the product of the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) and the sum of coefficients from the second polynomial:\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 64 = 384\n   \\]\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{384}\\)."

Calculating the coefficients, \\(\\dbinom{4}{0} = 1\\), \\(\\dbinom{4}{1} = 4\\), \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\), \\(\\dbinom{4}{3} = 4\\), and \\(\\dbinom{4}{4} = 1\\). So, the expansion is \\(a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). \n\nNow, I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which in this expansion is 6. But wait, the original expression isn't just \\((a + b)^4\\); it's multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I need to consider how this multiplication affects the coefficient I'm looking for. \n\nI think what's happening here is that when we multiply two expressions together, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I need to figure out if any of these multiplications will result in another \\(a^2b^2\\) term. Wait, but the second part of the expression only involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), which are separate variables from \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). So, when I multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by any term from the second expansion, the resulting terms will have powers of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), but the powers of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) will remain the same. \n\nThat means, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, no, that's not quite right. Because when you multiply two expressions together, the coefficients multiply. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) will be multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), so the total coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) will be \\(6 \\times\\) (sum of coefficients in the second expansion). \n\nWait, but hold on, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not considering \\(c\\) terms. So, actually, since \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by every term in the second expansion, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Because each term in the second part adds a multiple of \\(a^2b^2\\) when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). \n\nSo, to clarify, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nNow, let me calculate the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The sum of coefficients in a polynomial is found by setting all variables to 1. So, substituting \\(c = 1\\), we get \\(\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = (2)^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion is 64. \n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). \n\nWait, but let me double-check this because I might have made a mistake. Let me think again. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the first part, and when multiplied by each term in the second expansion, it becomes \\(a^2b^2\\) times each term in the second expansion. So, the coefficient is indeed 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64. So, 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of it as the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in one polynomial (like \\(a^2b^2\\)) is multiplied by the entire other polynomial. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 multiplied by the sum of the coefficients of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 64. So, 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nWait, but let me confirm if that's the correct approach. Another way to think about it is that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Since the second part doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), it's just a constant factor when considering the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. \n\nSo, yes, I think 384 is correct. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I can approach it differently. Let's expand both parts separately and then multiply the terms. \n\nFirst, as before, \\((a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). \n\nNow, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let's expand that using the binomial theorem. \n\nThe expansion is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). \n\nSo, the terms are:\n- When k=0: \\(\\dbinom{6}{0} c^{6} = 1 \\times c^6\\)\n- k=1: \\(\\dbinom{6}{1} c^{4} = 6c^4\\)\n- k=2: \\(\\dbinom{6}{2} c^{2} = 15c^2\\)\n- k=3: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} c^{0} = 20\\)\n- k=4: \\(\\dbinom{6}{4} c^{-2} = 15c^{-2}\\)\n- k=5: \\(\\dbinom{6}{5} c^{-4} = 6c^{-4}\\)\n- k=6: \\(\\dbinom{6}{6} c^{-6} = 1c^{-6}\\)\n\nSo, the expansion is \\(c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15/c^2 + 6/c^4 + 1/c^6\\).\n\nNow, when we multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. \n\nBut since we are only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which comes from the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion. When we multiply this by each term in the second expansion, the resulting terms will be \\(6a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(6a^2b^2c^4\\), \\(6a^2b^2c^2\\), \\(6a^2b^2 \\times 20\\), \\(6a^2b^2 \\times 15/c^2\\), etc. \n\nBut the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term without any \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\) factors. So, among all these terms, the only one that contributes to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the term where the second factor is a constant, i.e., when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. \n\nLooking at the second expansion, the constant term is 20. So, when \\(6a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by 20, we get \\(120a^2b^2\\). \n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120. \n\nWait a minute, this contradicts my earlier conclusion of 384. So, now I'm confused. Which approach is correct? \n\nLet me analyze both methods. \n\nIn the first approach, I considered that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 (from the first expansion) multiplied by the sum of coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, giving 384. \n\nIn the second approach, I considered that only the constant term in the second expansion (which is 20) contributes to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), giving 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nWhich one is correct? \n\nI think the second approach is correct because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, only the term with \\(c^0\\) (i.e., 20) will result in a term that is just \\(a^2b^2\\). All other terms will have additional powers of \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), so they won't contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) alone. \n\nSo, why did the first approach give me 384? Because in that approach, I assumed that all coefficients in the second expansion contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is not the case. Only the constant term contributes because the other terms introduce \\(c\\) powers, making the term not just \\(a^2b^2\\). \n\nTherefore, the correct coefficient should be 120. \n\nWait, but let me think again. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, actually, no, that's not the case. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) is a monomial, and in the product, each term will have some combination of \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\), and \\(1/c\\). So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I need to consider all terms in the expansion where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2 and 2, respectively, regardless of the exponents of \\(c\\). \n\nWait, hold on, that changes things. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a monomial, but in the context of the entire expression, which includes \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, perhaps I need to consider that when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) can be multiplied by any term from the second expansion, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), etc. But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not considering the \\(c\\) terms. So, does that mean we're only looking for the term where the exponents of \\(c\\) are zero? Or are we considering all possible exponents of \\(c\\)?\n\nWait, I think I need to clarify the problem statement. It says, \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, in the entire expression, which is a product of two polynomials, we're looking for the coefficient of the monomial \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). But actually, in the product, each term will have some combination of \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\), and \\(1/c\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will only appear if the second factor contributes a term with \\(c^0\\), because otherwise, the term would have \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\) multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). \n\nWait, no, actually, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would only be present if the second factor contributes a term with \\(c^0\\), because otherwise, the term would have \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\) multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), which would make it a different term. So, for example, \\(a^2b^2c^6\\) is a different term from \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is only the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part. \n\nSo, that would be 6 (from the first expansion) multiplied by 20 (the constant term in the second expansion), giving 120. \n\nTherefore, the correct coefficient is 120. \n\nBut wait, let me think again. If the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, does that mean we're supposed to collect all terms that have \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by any power of \\(c\\), and then sum their coefficients? Or is it only the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\)? \n\nLooking back at the problem statement: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" In algebra, when we talk about the coefficient of a specific monomial in a product, we usually mean the coefficient when that monomial appears without any other variables. So, in this case, \\(a^2b^2\\) is a monomial in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and in the product, it would only appear as a standalone term if the other factor contributes a constant term (i.e., \\(c^0\\)). Otherwise, it would be multiplied by some power of \\(c\\), making it a different term. \n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nSo, my initial approach was wrong because I incorrectly assumed that all coefficients in the second expansion contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but actually, only the constant term does. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer is 120. \n\nWait, but let me check again by considering the entire expansion. \n\nThe entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Let's denote the first part as \\(P = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\) and the second part as \\(Q = c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15/c^2 + 6/c^4 + 1/c^6\\). \n\nWhen we multiply P and Q, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in P will be multiplied by each term in Q, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), etc. The only term in Q that doesn't have a \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\) factor is 20. So, when \\(6a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by 20, we get \\(120a^2b^2\\). All other multiplications result in terms that have \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\) factors, so they don't contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). \n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 120. \n\nI think I confused myself earlier by considering the sum of all coefficients in Q, but that approach is only valid if we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product when considering all possible terms, which isn't the case here.

That means the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. \n\nBut wait, the original problem is \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I need to consider the entire expression, not just \\((a + b)^4\\). Hmm, so does that mean I have to multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) and find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product? \n\nWait, actually, no. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), so when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part will be multiplied by every term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would actually be 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), right?\n\nWait, no, that's not quite right. Because when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficients multiply. So, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). However, since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term in \\((a + b)^4\\), and the other factor is in terms of \\(c\\), the product will have terms like \\(a^2b^2 \\cdot c^k\\) and \\(a^2b^2 \\cdot c^{-k}\\), but the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) itself would actually be the same as in \\((a + b)^4\\) because the other factor doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. \n\nWait, now I'm confused. Let me think again. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by every term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 (the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\)) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nWait, but that doesn't make sense because the terms in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) are in terms of \\(c\\), so when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), they become terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2c^{-k}\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is only the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, because the \\(c\\) terms don't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) exponents. \n\nWait, but that seems too simple. Maybe I'm misunderstanding the question. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, they are asking for the coefficient of the term where \\(a\\) is squared and \\(b\\) is squared, regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in the product, \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by all the terms from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nWait, but the sum of the coefficients in a polynomial is found by setting all variables to 1. So, if I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) becomes \\((1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of the coefficients is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me double-check that. So, when you have two polynomials multiplied together, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each polynomial, provided that the variables multiply appropriately. But in this case, \\(a^2b^2\\) is only from the first polynomial, and the second polynomial is in terms of \\(c\\). So, when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second polynomial, you get terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2c^{-k}\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial, which is 6, multiplied by the entire second polynomial, but since the question is only about the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), it's 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial.\n\nAlternatively, maybe another approach is to consider that the variables \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are independent of \\(c\\), so when you expand the entire product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by all possible terms from the second polynomial, which are in \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second polynomial.\n\nBut let me think again: if I have \\( (a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 \\), and I want the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), that would be the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, since \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is a polynomial in \\(c\\), when you multiply it by \\(a^2b^2\\), you get \\(a^2b^2\\) times that polynomial, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of the second polynomial. But since we're only interested in the coefficient, not the entire term, it's 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second polynomial.\n\nBut wait, the sum of the coefficients in the second polynomial is when \\(c = 1\\), so \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can think of it as the coefficient being 6 multiplied by each term in the second polynomial, but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\), it's 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nBut wait, another thought: perhaps the question is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, which is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), and it's multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the entire expansion of the second polynomial, which is 6 * \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient, not the polynomial itself, we need to find the sum of the coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but another approach: perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, considering all possible terms. But since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the same as in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\), and when you multiply it by the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the product will be of the form \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2c^{-k}\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of the second polynomial. But since the question is only about the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), it's 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me confirm this with an example. Suppose I have a simpler case: \\((a + b)^1 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, \\((a + b)(c + 1/c)\\). The expansion would be \\(a c + a/c + b c + b/c\\). The coefficient of \\(a^1b^0\\) is \\(c + 1/c\\), and the coefficient of \\(a^0b^1\\) is also \\(c + 1/c\\). So, if I were to ask for the coefficient of \\(a^1b^0\\), it would be \\(c + 1/c\\), which is the same as the expansion of the second polynomial. Similarly, in the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the expansion of the second polynomial, but since we're only interested in the coefficient, not the variable part, it's 6 times the sum of the coefficients, which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is to consider that the entire expression is a product of two polynomials, and the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the product of the coefficients of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial and the constant term (if any) in the second polynomial. But no, that's not the case here because the second polynomial doesn't have a constant term. Wait, actually, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) does have a constant term. Let me check: the general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - k}(1/c)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, the constant term occurs when \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, if I were to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), it would be 6 * 20 = 120. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, that would include all terms where the power of \\(c\\) is anything, but since \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by all terms in the second polynomial, the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me think again. If I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = (1 + 1)^6 = 64\\), so the sum of the coefficients is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), but that's not what's being asked. The problem specifically asks for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), without any condition on \\(c\\). Therefore, it's 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit unsure because sometimes when you have multiple variables, the coefficient is the product of the coefficients from each part. But in this case, since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just the coefficient from the first part, multiplied by the entire second polynomial. But since we're only interested in the coefficient, not the variable part, it's 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 64, so 384.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of it as the entire expression being a product of two polynomials, and the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the sum of all products where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any term from the second polynomial. Since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term in the first polynomial, and the second polynomial is multiplied by it, the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but to make sure, let me consider a simpler case. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^1 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, expanding, I get \\(a c + a/c + b c + b/c\\). The coefficient of \\(a^1b^0\\) is \\(c + 1/c\\), and the coefficient of \\(a^0b^1\\) is also \\(c + 1/c\\). So, if I were to ask for the coefficient of \\(a^1b^0\\), it's \\(c + 1/c\\), which is the same as the sum of the coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 2 (when \\(c = 1\\)). So, in that case, the coefficient of \\(a^1b^0\\) is 2, which is 1 (the coefficient from the first polynomial) times 2 (the sum of coefficients in the second polynomial). Similarly, in the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the sum of coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nTherefore, I think the coefficient is 384.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break down the problem as follows:\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\dbinom{4}{0}a^4 + \\dbinom{4}{1}a^3b + \\dbinom{4}{2}a^2b^2 + \\dbinom{4}{3}ab^3 + \\dbinom{4}{4}b^4\n   \\]\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n\n2. **Consider the second polynomial \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   The sum of the coefficients in this polynomial is found by setting \\(c = 1\\):\n   \\[\n   \\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\n   \\]\n\n3. **Multiply the coefficient from the first polynomial by the sum of the coefficients in the second polynomial:**\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 64 = 384\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is \\(\\boxed{384}\\)."

    "text": " \n\nWait, but I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So maybe I don't need to expand the entire thing, just the part where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2. So, in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\), the term with \\(a^2b^2\\) would be when \\(k = 2\\) in the binomial expansion. Let me calculate that. The binomial coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\), which is 6. So, the term is \\(6a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient from the first part is 6. \n\nNow, the second part of the expression is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Hmm, I need to think about how this interacts with the first part. Since the two parts are multiplied together, the entire expression is the product of two expansions. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term from the second expansion. But wait, I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). But the second expansion is in terms of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), so when I multiply, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will just be multiplied by each term from the second expansion, but since \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) don't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression will just be the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the entire second expansion. Wait, no, that can't be right because the second expansion is a sum, so actually, each term in the second expansion will be multiplied by the terms from the first expansion. But since I'm only looking for \\(a^2b^2\\), which comes from the first part, the second part can contribute any term, but since I'm only interested in \\(a^2b^2\\), maybe the second part doesn't affect the coefficient? Wait, no, that doesn't make sense because the entire expression is the product of both expansions. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) will be the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all terms in the second part. Wait, but that would mean the coefficient is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which would be 6 times \\(2^6 = 64\\), so 6*64=384. But that seems too big, and I'm not sure if that's correct.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think again. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is only affected by the first part, and the second part contributes a factor that doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\). So, when you multiply the two expressions together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) will be the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. But wait, that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial in \\(c\\), but the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not considering \\(c\\). So maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, so the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that seems odd because the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) would be found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\(2^6 = 64\\). So then the coefficient would be 6*64=384. But I'm not sure if that's the case because the problem might be expecting a different approach.\n\nWait, maybe I'm making a mistake here. Let me try another approach. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). To find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I can think of it as first expanding \\((a + b)^4\\) to get terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and then multiplying each of those terms by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But since I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), that term comes only from the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient would be 6 (from the \\(a^2b^2\\) term) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). But that might not make sense because the product includes both \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms and \\(c\\) terms. Wait, no, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me clarify: when the problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", it's referring to the coefficient in the entire expansion, considering all possible terms, including those with \\(c\\). But that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which would be a polynomial in \\(c\\). But that seems unlikely because the problem is probably expecting a numerical coefficient, not a polynomial.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable, so the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some \\(k\\), but since it's not specified, maybe it's just 6 times the sum of the coefficients, which is 384. But I'm not entirely sure. Let me check again.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think of the entire expression as a product of two independent expansions. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first part, and the second part can contribute any term from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Because when you multiply, each term in the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all coefficients from the second part.\n\nThe sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of coefficients is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nWait, but that seems too straightforward, and I'm not sure if that's the intended approach. Alternatively, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial. But the problem is probably expecting a numerical coefficient, so perhaps it's 384.\n\nWait, but let me think again. If I have \\((a + b)^4\\) times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), then when I expand this, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, which includes terms like \\(c^6\\), \\(c^4\\), etc., down to \\(c^{-6}\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient from the first part (which is 6) multiplied by each coefficient from the second part, but since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), the coefficient would actually be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would mean that the coefficient is a polynomial, not a single number. So, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, considering all possible powers of \\(c\\), which would be 6 times the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that seems odd because the problem is likely expecting a numerical coefficient.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, without considering the \\(c\\) terms, so the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion. Since the sum of coefficients in the second expansion is 64, then the coefficient would be 6*64=384. That seems plausible.\n\nWait, but let me check this with a different approach. Let's expand both parts separately and then multiply them. The expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is:\n\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\n\\]\n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6.\n\nNow, the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) can be found using the binomial theorem as well:\n\n\\[\n\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n\\]\n\nSo, each term in this expansion is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\) for \\(k = 0\\) to \\(6\\).\n\nNow, when we multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product will be 6 multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients from the second expansion. \n\nThe sum of all coefficients in the second expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me confirm this because sometimes when variables are involved, you have to consider cross terms, but in this case, since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), their coefficients aren't affected by the powers of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6*64=384.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem had asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for a specific \\(k\\), then we would have to compute 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^k\\) in the second expansion. But since it's just \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\), the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 384.\n\nWait, but another way to think about it is that since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are independent variables, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and the sum of all coefficients in the second part. So, yes, 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nI think that makes sense. So, the coefficient is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplying it by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is \\(2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\boxed{384}."

Calculating the coefficients, that's \\(1a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + 1b^4\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in this part is 6. But wait, the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I need to consider how that affects the coefficient. Hmm, maybe I should think of the entire expression as a product of two separate expansions. So, the first part is \\((a + b)^4\\) and the second part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Since these are multiplied together, the terms from each expansion will multiply term by term. But I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). That means I don't need to worry about the terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\) because they won't affect the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. Wait, actually, no. Because when you multiply the two expansions together, each term in the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will only come from the first part, and the second part will contribute a constant factor. Wait, no, that's not quite right. Let me think again. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, if I expand both, each term in the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), that means we need to find the terms where the product of the two expansions results in \\(a^2b^2\\). But since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first expansion will be multiplied by every term in the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Wait, is that correct? Let me make sure. So, in other words, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first part will be multiplied by every term in the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of the coefficients of all terms in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\). So, \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 64 (the sum of coefficients in the second part), which is 6 * 64 = 384. Hmm, that seems high. Let me check again. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) don't affect the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), because when you multiply by the other part, you're just scaling the entire expression by the sum of its coefficients. Wait, but that's not exactly accurate because each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, which includes different powers of \\(c\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), we need to consider all the terms in the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is indeed 6 multiplied by the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, giving 384. But wait, I think that's correct. Let me think differently. Suppose I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = (1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, the entire expression becomes \\((a + b)^4 * 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 * 64 = 384. That makes sense. Alternatively, if I didn't set \\(c = 1\\), I could think of it as the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion is 64, so when you multiply, each term in the first expansion is scaled by 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 * 64 = 384. So, I think that's the answer. Wait, but let me double-check. Another way to think about it is: The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). When you expand this, each term is of the form \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}a^{4 - k}b^k \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - m}(1/c)^m\\). Simplifying the second part, \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the term involving \\(a^2b^2\\) is when \\(k = 2\\), so \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}a^2b^2\\), and this is multiplied by \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} \\times \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m}\\). But \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} = 2^6 = 64\\), so the coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384. Yes, that confirms it. So, I think the answer is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n\\boxed{384}"

    "text": " Wait, but I don't need the entire expansion, just the part that will give me \\(a^2b^2\\). So, I should find the term where the power of \\(a\\) is 2 and the power of \\(b\\) is 2. Since the exponent is 4, the sum of the exponents should be 4. So, \\(a^2b^2\\) is the term where \\(a\\) is squared and \\(b\\) is squared. Using the binomial coefficient, the coefficient for this term would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) because we choose 2 positions out of 4 for either \\(a\\) or \\(b\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\\). So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. Now, the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, the term we're interested in is \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\) at all.

Wait, that might not be right. Let me think again. Actually, when you multiply two expressions together, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression. So, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first part will be multiplied by every term in the second part. But since we're just interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and the second part doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms, the coefficient will just be 6 times the entire expansion of the second part. But wait, no, that's not correct because the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because when you multiply by the entire expansion of the second part, each term in the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part. So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Now, how do I find the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)? I remember that the sum of the coefficients in a polynomial is found by plugging in 1 for all variables. So, if I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = (1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 times 64, which is 384. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake here. Another way to think about it is that when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each polynomial. Since \\(a^2b^2\\) only comes from the first part, and the second part is multiplied in full, the coefficient will indeed be 6 multiplied by the sum of the coefficients of the second part. Alternatively, since the second part is a separate polynomial, when you multiply, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will have a coefficient that's 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial. So, yes, 6 times 64 is 384. Wait, but let me check again. Alternatively, maybe I should consider that the second part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a Laurent polynomial, but when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), it doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms, so the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) is just 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second part. So, 6 times 64 is 384. Therefore, I think the coefficient is 384. But let me think again: when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a term is the sum of the products of the coefficients of terms whose variables multiply to give that term. But in this case, since \\(a^2b^2\\) is only in the first polynomial, and the second polynomial is in \\(c\\), the variables don't interfere. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial. So, yes, 6 times 64 is 384. Alternatively, if I expand both polynomials, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384.

That means I can't just stop here; I need to consider how this term interacts with the second part of the expression, which is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nSo, I think I need to multiply each term from the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) by each term from the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).

That means I just need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and then that term is multiplied by the entire second part. But wait, no, because the entire expression is a product of two polynomials, so each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, is that right?\n\nWait, no. Let me think again. If I have \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), then each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion.

So, in the entire product, \\(a^2b^2\\) will have a coefficient that is 6 multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nWait, but that doesn't make sense because each term in the second expansion has a different power of c, so when multiplied by \\(6a^2b^2\\), each term is a separate term in the product. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is just 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But actually, the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by setting c = 1. So, if I substitute c = 1, the expression becomes \\((1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\).

Alternatively, maybe the problem is expecting the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some specific k, but the problem doesn't specify, it's just \\(a^2b^2\\). So, perhaps the answer is 6 times the sum of coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nBut wait, another way to think about it: when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in one polynomial is multiplied by all terms in the other polynomial. So, in this case, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) from the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial, which has terms like \\(c^6\\), \\(6c^5\\), etc. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^6\\) would be 6 * 1 = 6, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^5\\) would be 6 * 6 = 36, and so on. But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of c, it's essentially the sum of all these coefficients, which is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second polynomial. Since the sum of coefficients in the second polynomial is 64, as calculated earlier, the total coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without considering the c terms, which would mean that the coefficient is just 6, but that seems unlikely because the entire expression includes the c terms, so the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of coefficients in the second expansion.\n\nWait, but let me think again. The problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\". In the entire product, \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, because each term in the second expansion contributes to a term with \\(a^2b^2\\) times that coefficient. Therefore, the coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nBut wait, let me check with another approach. Let's consider that the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). If I expand this, each term will be of the form \\(a^kb^{4 - k} \\times c^m\\) where m ranges from -6 to 6. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part, because for each term in the second part, you get a term \\(a^2b^2c^m\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, considering all possible c terms, but since the problem doesn't specify a particular power of c, I think the answer is 384.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. Let's consider a simpler case. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^1 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, the expansion would be \\((a + b)(c + 1/c) = a c + a/c + b c + b/c\\). The coefficient of \\(a\\) in this product is the coefficient of \\(a\\) in the first part, which is 1, multiplied by the sum of coefficients in the second part, which is 2 (since \\(c + 1/c\\) evaluated at c=1 is 2). So, the coefficient of \\(a\\) would be 1 * 2 = 2, which makes sense because in the expansion, the terms with \\(a\\) are \\(a c\\) and \\(a/c\\), each with coefficient 1, so total coefficient is 2. Similarly, the coefficient of \\(b\\) would also be 2.\n\nSo, applying the same logic, in our original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 multiplied by the sum of coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient is 384.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). To find the sum of coefficients, we set c = 1. So, \\((1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). That's correct.\n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nI think that's the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is found by first determining the coefficient in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplying it by the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 64.

Since multiplication is involved, I might need to consider how the terms from each expansion combine. However, I notice that the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from those involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). That is, each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), I think that the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nWait, no, that doesn't make sense because when you multiply, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) gets multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't have \\(c\\) in it, that would mean we need to find the term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) that is a constant term, i.e., the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. Because if we multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by \\(c^k\\) or \\(c^{-k}\\), it would give \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2c^{-k}\\), but we only want the term where \\(c\\) cancels out, so that the result is just \\(a^2b^2\\). \n\nSo, first, let me find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which I already found to be 6. Then, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because when I multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by this term, it will give me \\(a^2b^2\\) times the constant term. \n\nNow, let's focus on \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Again, using the binomial theorem, this expansion is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k\\). Simplifying that, each term becomes \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} c^{-k} = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, so we set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(6 = 2k\\) which gives \\(k = 3\\). \n\nSo, the term where \\(k = 3\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} c^{0}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. \n\nPutting it all together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the coefficient from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 6 times 20. That gives 120. \n\nWait, let me double-check that. So, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, and in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. So, when I multiply these two parts together, each term from \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term from the other expansion. So, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part will be multiplied by the constant term (20) from the second part, giving 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120. \n\nI think that makes sense. Alternatively, if I were to expand the entire expression, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term would only come from the product of the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in \\((a + b)^4\\) and the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because any other term would involve \\(c\\) to some power, which would change the term to something like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2c^{-k}\\), which we're not interested in. So, yes, the coefficient is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplying it by the constant term (coefficient of \\(c^0\\)) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20. Thus, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\(\\boxed{120}\\)"

So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) here is 6. \n\nWait, but the problem isn't just \\((a + b)^4\\), it's multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I need to consider the entire expression. That means I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product of these two expansions. \n\nLet me think: when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficients of the terms combine. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But since I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I don't need to consider the terms involving \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), because multiplying by those will change the variables. \n\nWait, is that right? Because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). Hmm, actually, no, that's not correct. Wait, no, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so it's just the coefficient, and since \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) are separate variables, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) can be multiplied by any power of \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), but the coefficient itself would just be the product of the coefficients from each part. \n\nWait, but actually, when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first polynomial gets multiplied by each term in the second polynomial, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire second part, because \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\). So, actually, the coefficient would just be 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. \n\nWait, no, that's not right either. Because the second expansion is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which also has multiple terms. Each term in the second expansion is a coefficient times some power of \\(c\\). But since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, the coefficient would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the entire second expansion. But that would make the coefficient a sum of terms involving \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. \n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)\". So, it's looking for the coefficient of the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product. That means that term \\(a^2b^2\\) can be multiplied by any power of \\(c\\), but the coefficient is just the product of the coefficients from each part. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. \n\nWait, but the second expansion is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). The sum of the coefficients in this expansion would be when we set \\(c = 1\\). So, if I substitute \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(1 + 1/1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nWait, but that seems high. Let me double-check. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Since the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6a^2b^2, and when we multiply by the second part, which is a polynomial in c, the term 6a^2b^2 will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in the second expansion. Because each term in the second expansion is a coefficient times some power of c, and when multiplied by 6a^2b^2, it becomes 6 times that coefficient times a^2b^2 times c^k for some k. So, the coefficient of a^2b^2 is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. \n\nAnd as I thought before, the sum of coefficients in the second expansion is when c = 1, so (1 + 1)^6 = 64. So, 6 * 64 = 384. So, the coefficient is 384. \n\nWait, but let me check another way. Let's consider the entire expansion. The coefficient of a^2b^2 is 6, as we found from the first part. The second part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), can be expanded using the binomial theorem as well. The expansion is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\cdot (1/c)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). \n\nSo, each term in the second expansion is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). Now, when we multiply the two expansions together, each term from the first expansion is multiplied by each term from the second. So, the term 6a^2b^2 from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, resulting in terms like 6a^2b^2 \\cdot \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}. \n\nBut since the problem is asking for the coefficient of a^2b^2, regardless of the power of c, we can consider that the coefficient of a^2b^2 in the product is 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion. Because each term in the second expansion is a coefficient times c^{something}, so when multiplied by 6a^2b^2, the coefficient becomes 6 times the coefficient from the second expansion. \n\nTherefore, the total coefficient is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion. As calculated earlier, the sum of coefficients in the second expansion is (1 + 1)^6 = 64. So, 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nWait, but let me think again. Is this correct? Because when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in one polynomial is multiplied by the entire other polynomial. So, in this case, the term 6a^2b^2 is being multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which includes terms with different powers of c. So, the coefficient of a^2b^2 in the product would indeed be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, because each coefficient in the second expansion is being multiplied by 6, and the a^2b^2 term is just along for the ride. \n\nSo, yeah, that makes sense. Therefore, the coefficient is 384. \n\nWait, but let me check with a specific example. Let's say I have (a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4, as we saw. Now, the second part is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is a sum of terms with coefficients and powers of c. Let's say I pick the term 6a^2b^2 and multiply it by each term in the second expansion. So, 6a^2b^2 * (c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15/c^2 + 6/c^4 + 1/c^6). So, each term would be 6a^2b^2c^6, 36a^2b^2c^4, 90a^2b^2c^2, 120a^2b^2, 90a^2b^2/c^2, 36a^2b^2/c^4, and 6a^2b^2/c^6. \n\nSo, in this product, the term a^2b^2 appears with coefficients 6, 36, 90, 120, 90, 36, and 6, each multiplied by different powers of c. So, the coefficient of a^2b^2 regardless of c is 6 + 36 + 90 + 120 + 90 + 36 + 6. Let me add these up: 6 + 36 is 42, plus 90 is 132, plus 120 is 252, plus 90 is 342, plus 36 is 378, plus 6 is 384. So, that's 384. \n\nSo, that confirms it. The coefficient of a^2b^2 is 384. \n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me think if there's another way to approach this. Maybe using generating functions or something else. Alternatively, could I consider that the entire expression is a product of two independent expansions, so the coefficient of a^2b^2 would be the product of the coefficients from each part? But no, that's not quite right, because the second expansion has multiple terms. Wait, no, actually, that's exactly what we did. We took the coefficient of a^2b^2 from the first expansion, which is 6, and then multiplied it by the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion, which is 64, giving 384. \n\nAlternatively, if I were to compute the entire product, the coefficient of a^2b^2 would indeed be 6 times the sum of the coefficients from the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nSo, I think that's the correct answer. The coefficient is 384.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break down the problem into two parts using the binomial theorem.\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\):**\n   Using the binomial theorem, the expansion is:\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\dbinom{4}{0}a^4 + \\dbinom{4}{1}a^3b + \\dbinom{4}{2}a^2b^2 + \\dbinom{4}{3}ab^3 + \\dbinom{4}{4}b^4\n   \\]\n   Calculating the coefficients:\n   \\[\n   1 \\cdot a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + 1 \\cdot b^4\n   \\]\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6.\n\n2. **Sum the coefficients of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   The sum of the coefficients in a polynomial is found by setting the variable to 1. Thus, substituting \\(c = 1\\):\n   \\[\n   \\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\n   \\]\n\n3. **Combine the results:**\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the product of the coefficient from the first expansion and the sum of coefficients from the second expansion:\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 64 = 384\n   \\]\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{384}\\)."

    "text": " \n\nSo, expanding \\((a + b)^4\\), the general term is \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\\). I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which means I need the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2. So, let me find the value of \\(k\\) that gives me \\(b^2\\). Since the exponent of \\(b\\) is \\(k\\), then \\(k = 2\\). \n\nTherefore, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Let me compute that. \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient is 6. \n\nWait, but the original expression isn't just \\((a + b)^4\\), it's multiplied by another expression: \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I need to consider that as well. Hmm, but the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is only from the first part, right? So, when I multiply the two expressions together, I'm looking for the product of the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part and some term from the second part. But since I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I think I need to see if the second part contributes any factors that could affect this term. \n\nWait, no. Because \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), so when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the variables \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are all distinct. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will come from multiplying \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part by any term from the second part, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. But wait, actually, no. Because each term in the expansion will be a product of a term from the first expansion and a term from the second expansion. So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I have to consider all possible ways that \\(a^2b^2\\) can be multiplied by any term from the second expression. \n\nBut wait, no. Because \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), so when I multiply it by a term from the second expression, say \\(c^k\\) or \\(c^{-k}\\), it will result in a term like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2c^{-k}\\). But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, does that mean I'm looking for the term where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out? Or is it just the coefficient regardless of the \\(c\\) terms? Hmm, this is a bit confusing. \n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but the entire expression includes \\(c\\) terms as well. So, actually, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) can be multiplied by any term from the second expression, each contributing a different power of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be the sum of the coefficients from each term in the second expansion multiplied by 6 (the coefficient from the first part). \n\nWait, no, that doesn't make sense. Because when you multiply two expressions, the coefficients multiply. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part has a coefficient of 6, and when multiplied by each term from the second part, which is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term will have its own coefficient. So, the total coefficient for \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) will be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^k\\) in the second expression. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a bit ambiguous. Does it mean the coefficient regardless of \\(c\\), or considering all possible \\(c\\) terms? \n\nWait, perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), treating \\(c\\) as another variable, so it's actually the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out. Because otherwise, if it's just \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\), then it's an infinite number of terms, each with different powers of \\(c\\). So, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is the constant term with respect to \\(c\\). \n\nSo, if that's the case, I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire expression. So, that would be the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) from the second part. \n\nAlright, so let's break it down. \n\nFirst, from \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, as I found earlier. \n\nNow, from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), I need the coefficient of \\(c^0\\), which is the constant term. \n\nTo find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), I can use the binomial theorem again. The general term in the expansion is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). \n\nWe want the exponent of \\(c\\) to be 0, so we set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). \n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). \n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. \n\nNow, since the two expressions are multiplied together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficients from each part. That is, 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the second part). \n\nSo, 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 120. \n\nWait, let me double-check that. So, \\((a + b)^4\\) has \\(a^2b^2\\) with coefficient 6. \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) has a constant term with coefficient 20. Multiplying them gives 6 * 20 = 120. That seems correct. \n\nAlternatively, if the problem had been just \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient would be 6. But since it's multiplied by another expression, and we're looking for the term where the \\(c\\) terms cancel out, we have to multiply by the constant term of the second expression. So, yes, 120 is the correct coefficient. \n\nI think that's it. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning. So, the final answer should be 120.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break it down into two parts:\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\):**\n   Using the binomial theorem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n\n2. **Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   We need the constant term (where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0).

So, I can't just stop here because the entire expression is a product of two binomials raised to powers. Hmm, so maybe I need to expand both parts and then find the term where the variables are \\(a^2b^2\\) and see what the coefficient is. But wait, the second part is in terms of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), so when I multiply the two expressions, the variables involved are \\(a, b, c, 1/c\\). But the question is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\). That means that in the product, the \\(c\\) terms must cancel out such that they don't appear in the term \\(a^2b^2\\). So, I think I need to find terms in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) that result in a constant term (i.e., \\(c^0\\)), so that when multiplied by the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first expansion, the resulting term is \\(a^2b^2\\) times that constant. \n\nSo, let me first handle the \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) part. Again, using the binomial theorem, this would expand to \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k\\).

So, I need to find \\(k\\) such that \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Let me solve for \\(k\\): \\(6 - 2k = 0\\) implies \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the term where \\(k = 3\\) is the constant term. Let me calculate that term. The coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\), which is 20. So, the constant term is 20. \n\nNow, going back to the original expression: \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When we expand both parts, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first expansion is 6, and the constant term from the second expansion is 20. So, when we multiply these two parts together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 multiplied by 20, which is 120. \n\nWait, let me double-check that. So, the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the coefficient from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) that gives a constant term is 20. So, when I multiply these two expansions, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But since the second expansion has a constant term (20) and other terms with \\(c\\) raised to some power, only the constant term will contribute to the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the final product because multiplying by any \\(c\\) term would introduce \\(c\\) into the term, which we don't want. So, the only contribution comes from the constant term, which is 20. Therefore, the total coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nIs there another way to think about this? Maybe using multinomial coefficients or something else? Hmm, not sure. But the approach seems correct: find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, find the constant term in the second part, and multiply them together. Let me confirm the binomial coefficients again. For \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). For \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term where \\(c^0\\) is when \\(k = 3\\), and \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, 6 * 20 is 120. \n\nI think that's correct. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is found by considering the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6, and the constant term in the second part is 20. Multiplying these gives 6 * 20 = 120.\n\n\\boxed{120}"

Calculating the coefficients, that's \\(1a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + 1b^4\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6.\n\nNow, the expression also has \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I'm not sure how this part affects the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but I think I need to consider the entire product. Since the two parts are multiplied together, every term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by every term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). However, the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). That means I don't need to consider the terms involving \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), right? Wait, no, actually, I might need to think about whether the terms involving \\(c\\) affect the coefficient. But since we're only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term without \\(c\\), maybe I can just focus on the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) and then see how the other part contributes.\n\nWait, no, actually, when you multiply two expressions together, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression. So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I need to consider how \\(a^2b^2\\) is formed. It's formed by taking the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part, which is 6a\u00b2b\u00b2, and multiplying it by the constant term from the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because that's the only way to get a term without \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\). So, I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nLet me try expanding \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem as well. The expansion would be \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k\\). Simplifying each term, that's \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} c^{-k} = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, the exponent of \\(c\\) in each term is \\(6 - 2k\\). I need the term where the exponent is 0 because that's the constant term. So, I set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\), which is 20. So, the constant term in the second part is 20.\n\nNow, going back to the original expression, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the product of the coefficient from the first part and the constant term from the second part. So, that's \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120.\n\nWait, let me double-check that. So, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6. In \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the constant term is when \\(k=3\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, multiplying 6 and 20 gives 120. That seems correct. I don't think I made a mistake here because each step follows logically. So, I'm confident that the coefficient is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is found by expanding each part separately and then multiplying the relevant coefficients. \n\n1. Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is 6.\n2. Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) and find the constant term, which occurs when the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0. This happens at \\(k=3\\), giving a coefficient of 20.\n3. Multiply the two coefficients: \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\boxed{120}"

Calculating the binomial coefficients, that's \\(1a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + 1b^4\\). \n\nOkay, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. But wait, the problem is asking for the coefficient in the entire expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). That means I need to consider how the terms from both expansions multiply together. \n\nLet me think about this. The expression is a product of two separate binomial expansions: one in terms of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and another in terms of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). Since these are independent variables, the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) don't interact with the terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) when multiplying. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because when you multiply by something, it scales all the coefficients. \n\nWait, but actually, when you multiply two polynomials together, each term from the first polynomial multiplies each term from the second polynomial. But since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\), and \\(1/c\\) are all different variables, the only way a term can have \\(a^2b^2\\) is if the term from the second expansion doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\) at all. But actually, no, because the second expansion is in terms of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), so when you multiply, the variables are separate. So, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will just be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), that term would just be the coefficient from the first part times the entire second expansion. Wait, but that doesn't make sense because the second expansion has multiple terms. \n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), we just need the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, and then the entire second part is a separate factor. But actually, when you multiply, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, which includes various powers of \\(c\\). But since the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, that would mean we're summing over all possible coefficients from the second expansion, because each term in the second expansion will multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term, giving terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) and \\(a^2b^2c^{-k}\\), but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, the coefficient would actually be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part. \n\nWait, no, that doesn't seem right either. Let me think again. If I have \\((a + b)^4\\) times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), when I expand it, the terms will be products of terms from each expansion. So, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first part is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Because each term in the second expansion contributes a coefficient that multiplies the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. \n\nWait, but actually, the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\). Because substituting \\(c = 1\\) into \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 (from the first part) times 64 (sum of coefficients from the second part), which is 384. \n\nBut wait, let me check that. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, in the entire expansion, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by every possible term from the second expansion, so each of those terms will contribute a coefficient, and since we're summing over all possible \\(c\\) terms, the total coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6 times the sum of coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, so 6*64=384. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm supposed to consider that \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), so when you multiply by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which has terms with various powers of \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't make sense because when you multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), it becomes \\(a^2b^2\\) times the expansion, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the expansion. But the problem is asking for the coefficient, so perhaps they mean the coefficient as a numerical factor, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. \n\nWait, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, considering all possible terms. So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6*64=384. \n\nBut let me make sure. Let's consider the entire expansion. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first part, and when you multiply it by each term in the second expansion, each of those will contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is indeed the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part. \n\nAlternatively, another way to think about it is that when you have two polynomials multiplied together, the coefficient of a specific term in one polynomial is multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the other polynomial. So, in this case, since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is 6 in the first polynomial, and the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial is 64, the total coefficient is 6*64=384. \n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because the second polynomial is in terms of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), which are different variables. So, when you multiply, the variables don't interfere, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be 6 times the entire second polynomial. But the problem is asking for the coefficient, so I think it's referring to the numerical coefficient, not including the variables. So, if the second polynomial is expanded, each term in it is a coefficient times a power of \\(c\\), so when you multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), you get \\(a^2b^2\\) times each term, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial. \n\nTherefore, the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c=1\\), which gives \\( (1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6*64=384. \n\nWait, but let me confirm this with another approach. Alternatively, I can think of the entire product as a product of two independent expansions. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) would be the product of the coefficients from each expansion. But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), that would mean we need to sum over all possible \\(k\\) the coefficients of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\). \n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the sum over all \\(k\\) of (coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\)) times (coefficient of \\(c^k\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\)). But since the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6, the total coefficient is 6 times the sum over all \\(k\\) of the coefficients of \\(c^k\\) in the second part. \n\nBut the sum over all coefficients of \\(c^k\\) in the second part is the same as the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, as before. So, again, the total coefficient is 6*64=384. \n\nWait, but let me check if that makes sense. If I expand \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the sum of all coefficients is indeed 64, because each term is a coefficient times a power of \\(c\\), and when \\(c=1\\), the sum is 64. So, when I multiply the entire expansion by \\(a^2b^2\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6*64=384. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think of it as two separate expansions. The first expansion is \\((a + b)^4\\), and the second is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). The product is the sum over all terms from the first expansion multiplied by terms from the second. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. \n\nYes, that makes sense because each term in the first expansion is multiplied by every term in the second expansion. So, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, each contributing their own coefficient. Therefore, the total coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, giving 384. \n\nWait, but let me think differently. Suppose I consider the entire expression as \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). If I want the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\), then it's equivalent to taking the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and multiplying it by the entire second part. So, the coefficient would be 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), not a numerical coefficient. \n\nWait, but the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so perhaps it's expecting a numerical coefficient, meaning that it's considering all possible terms involving \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, so 6*64=384. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some specific \\(k\\), but it just says \\(a^2b^2\\), so I think it's considering all possible \\(c\\) terms, so the coefficient is 384. \n\nWait, but let me check with a smaller example to make sure. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^1 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, the expansion would be \\(a c + a/c + b c + b/c\\). The coefficient of \\(a^1b^0\\) would be \\(c + 1/c\\), but if we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^1b^0\\) regardless of \\(c\\), it's the sum of coefficients, which is 2. So, in that case, the coefficient would be 1 (from \\((a + b)^1\\)) times 2 (sum of coefficients in \\((c + 1/c)^1\\)), which is 2. \n\nSimilarly, in the problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times 64, which is 384. So, that seems consistent. \n\nTherefore, I think the answer is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), giving \\(2^6 = 64\\). Multiplying these together, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n\\boxed{384}"

Let me calculate that: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\\). So, the coefficient from the first part is 6. \n\nNow, the expression also has another part, which is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I'm not sure if this part affects the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), because \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) are separate variables from \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). Wait, maybe not. Let me think. The entire expression is the product of \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).

In other words, the second part must contribute a term that's just a constant (with respect to \\(a\\) and \\(b\\)), so that when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), it remains \\(a^2b^2\\). \n\nWait, but actually, no, because the second part is in terms of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), so when I multiply, each term in the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. However, the problem is asking specifically for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, perhaps I need to consider that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the entire second part, because the second part doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\). Is that right? \n\nWait, no, that doesn't seem correct. Because when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second, so the coefficient for a specific term in the first part would be multiplied by each term in the second part, leading to multiple terms in the product. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\), I think we can treat the second part as a constant with respect to \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all coefficients from the second part. \n\nWait, but that might not be right either. Let me clarify. Let's denote \\(P = (a + b)^4\\) and \\(Q = \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Then, the product \\(P \\times Q\\) will have terms like \\(a^kb^{4 - k} \\times c^m c^{-n}\\), but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\), perhaps the coefficient is just the coefficient from \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(P\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(Q\\). But that seems confusing. Maybe another approach is better. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can consider that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is equal to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(P\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(Q\\). Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in \\(Q\\), you get \\(a^2b^2\\) times each term in \\(Q\\), so the total coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient from \\(P\\) times the sum of coefficients from \\(Q\\). \n\nBut wait, the sum of coefficients in \\(Q\\) is obtained by setting \\(c = 1\\), right? Because substituting \\(c = 1\\) into \\(Q\\) gives the sum of all coefficients. So, let me compute \\(Q\\) at \\(c = 1\\): \\(\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = (2)^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of coefficients in \\(Q\\) is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 (from \\(P\\)) times 64 (sum of coefficients in \\(Q\\)), which is 384. \n\nWait, but is that correct? Let me check. Because each term in \\(Q\\) is a term involving powers of \\(c\\), so when I multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in \\(Q\\), I get terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for various \\(k\\).

Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is indeed the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(P\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(Q\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\), the coefficient would be 6 (from \\(P\\)) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(Q\\), which is 64, giving 384. \n\nWait, but let me think again. When you multiply two expressions, the coefficients combine.

So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(P \\times Q\\) would be the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(P\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(Q\\), because each term in \\(Q\\) contributes a coefficient when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). \n\nWait, but in \\(P\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, as we found earlier. Then, the sum of coefficients in \\(Q\\) is 64, as calculated by setting \\(c = 1\\). So, the total coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Since \\(Q\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(P\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is just the coefficient from \\(P\\) times the entire \\(Q\\), but since we're only interested in the coefficient, it's 6 times the sum of coefficients in \\(Q\\), which is 64, so 6*64=384. \n\nWait, but let me check if that's accurate. Let me think of a simpler example. Suppose \\(P = (a + b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2\\) and \\(Q = (c + 1/c)^1 = c + 1/c\\). Then, the product \\(P \\times Q = (a^2 + 2ab + b^2)(c + 1/c)\\). The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in this product would be zero because there's no \\(a^2b^2\\) term. Wait, that's a problem because according to my earlier reasoning, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(P\\) (which is zero) times the sum of coefficients in \\(Q\\) (which is 2), so 0*2=0, which is correct. But in this case, \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't appear at all because the highest power in \\(P\\) is \\(a^2b^0\\) and \\(a^0b^2\\), so no \\(a^2b^2\\) term. So, that seems to work. \n\nAnother example: Let \\(P = (a + b)^3 = a^3 + 3a^2b + 3ab^2 + b^3\\) and \\(Q = (c + 1/c)^1 = c + 1/c\\). Then, the product \\(P \\times Q = (a^3 + 3a^2b + 3ab^2 + b^3)(c + 1/c)\\). The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in this product would be 3 (from \\(3a^2b\\)) times the sum of coefficients in \\(Q\\), which is 2, so 3*2=6. But looking at the product, the terms involving \\(a^2b\\) would be \\(3a^2b \\times c = 3a^2bc\\) and \\(3a^2b \\times 1/c = 3a^2b/c\\). There's no \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the product because \\(Q\\) doesn't have a \\(b\\) term. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is zero, but according to my earlier reasoning, it's 3*2=6, which is incorrect. \n\nWait, so that contradicts my earlier conclusion. So, my reasoning must be flawed. What's the issue here? \n\nIn this example, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(P \\times Q\\) is zero because \\(Q\\) doesn't have any \\(b\\) terms. So, when I multiply \\(3a^2b\\) by \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), I get \\(3a^2bc\\) and \\(3a^2b/c\\), but no \\(a^2b^2\\) term. So, the coefficient remains zero. But according to my earlier approach, I would have thought it's 3*2=6, which is wrong. So, my initial approach is incorrect. \n\nTherefore, my mistake was assuming that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient from \\(P\\) times the sum of coefficients in \\(Q\\). But that's only true if \\(Q\\) doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), which it doesn't, but in reality, when you multiply \\(P\\) by \\(Q\\), each term in \\(P\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(Q\\), but since \\(Q\\) doesn't have \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), the variables \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) only come from \\(P\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is indeed the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(P\\) times the entire expansion of \\(Q\\). But in the example, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(P\\) is zero, so the product's coefficient is zero, which matches. \n\nWait, but in my second example, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(P\\) is zero, so the product's coefficient is zero. So, perhaps my initial reasoning was correct. Let me go back to the original problem. \n\nIn the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(P = (a + b)^4\\) is 6, as we found. Now, since \\(Q = \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), when we multiply \\(P\\) by \\(Q\\), each term in \\(P\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(Q\\), but the variables \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) only come from \\(P\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is indeed 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(Q\\), which is 64, giving 6*64=384. \n\nWait, but in my second example, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(P\\) was zero, so the product's coefficient was zero, which matches. So, perhaps my initial reasoning was correct. \n\nWait, but in the second example, \\(P = (a + b)^3\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is zero because \\(a^2b^2\\) would require \\(k=2\\) in the expansion, but the exponent is 3, so \\(n=3\\), and \\(k=2\\) would give \\(a^{1}b^{2}\\), which is \\(ab^2\\), not \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(P\\) is zero, hence the product's coefficient is zero. \n\nTherefore, in the original problem, since the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(P\\) is 6, and the sum of coefficients in \\(Q\\) is 64, the coefficient in the product is 6*64=384. \n\nWait, but let me check another example to be sure. Let's take \\(P = (a + b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2\\) and \\(Q = (c + 1/c)^1 = c + 1/c\\). The product \\(P \\times Q = (a^2 + 2ab + b^2)(c + 1/c)\\). The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in this product would be zero because there's no \\(a^2b^2\\) term. According to my reasoning, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(P\\) is zero, so the product's coefficient is zero, which is correct. \n\nAnother example: \\(P = (a + b)^4\\), \\(Q = (c + 1/c)^6\\). The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(P\\) is 6, sum of coefficients in \\(Q\\) is 64, so the product's coefficient is 6*64=384. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can think of it as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is equal to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(P\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(Q\\), because each term in \\(Q\\) adds a coefficient when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). \n\nWait, but let me think about how the multiplication works. Each term in \\(P\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(Q\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from \\(P\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(Q\\), which are \\(c^6\\), \\(6c^4\\), \\(15c^2\\), \\(20\\), \\(15c^{-2}\\), \\(6c^{-4}\\), \\(c^{-6}\\). So, when I multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each of these, I get terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(6a^2b^2c^4\\), etc. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, in the product, \\(a^2b^2\\) is present with coefficients from each term in \\(Q\\). Therefore, the total coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient from \\(P\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(Q\\), because each term in \\(Q\\) contributes its coefficient to \\(a^2b^2\\) when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). \n\nSo, in this case, the coefficient from \\(P\\) is 6, and the sum of coefficients in \\(Q\\) is 64, so 6*64=384. \n\nWait, but let me make sure. Let's compute the sum of coefficients in \\(Q\\). \\(Q = \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). The sum of coefficients is obtained by setting \\(c = 1\\), so \\(Q(1) = (1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, that's correct. \n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6*64=384. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can think of it as the entire expression being the product of two polynomials, and the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial and the sum of coefficients in the second polynomial. \n\nYes, that seems to make sense. So, the final answer should be 384. \n\nWait, but just to be thorough, let me compute the expansion of \\(Q\\) to make sure. \n\n\\(Q = \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem, this is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). \n\nSo, the terms are:\n\n- \\(m=0\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{0}c^6 = 1 \\cdot c^6\\)\n- \\(m=1\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{1}c^4 = 6c^4\\)\n- \\(m=2\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{2}c^2 = 15c^2\\)\n- \\(m=3\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}c^0 = 20\\)\n- \\(m=4\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{4}c^{-2} = 15c^{-2}\\)\n- \\(m=5\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{5}c^{-4} = 6c^{-4}\\)\n- \\(m=6\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{6}c^{-6} = 1c^{-6}\\)\n\nSo, the sum of coefficients is indeed \\(1 + 6 + 15 + 20 + 15 + 6 + 1 = 64\\). \n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nWait, but let me think again. Suppose I didn't know this shortcut. Could I compute it another way? For example, expanding both parts and then looking for the coefficient. But that would be tedious, especially for higher exponents. But perhaps it's a good way to verify. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can consider that since \\(Q\\) doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(P\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(Q\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient, not the entire term, it's equivalent to multiplying the coefficient from \\(P\\) by the sum of coefficients in \\(Q\\). \n\nYes, that seems to make sense. So, I think I'm confident that the coefficient is 384. \n\nWait, but let me check one more thing. Suppose I have \\(P = (a + b)^4\\) and \\(Q = \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). When I multiply them, each term in \\(P\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(Q\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from \\(P\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(Q\\), which are \\(c^6\\), \\(6c^4\\), \\(15c^2\\), \\(20\\), \\(15c^{-2}\\), \\(6c^{-4}\\), \\(c^{-6}\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be \\(6 \\times (1 + 6 + 15 + 20 + 15 + 6 + 1)\\), which is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). \n\nYes, that seems correct. So, the coefficient is 384. \n\nTherefore, after all this thinking and checking, I believe the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is found using the binomial coefficient \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). The sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is obtained by setting \\(c = 1\\), giving \\(2^6 = 64\\). Multiplying these results gives \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\boxed{384}."

Calculating the coefficients, that's \\(1a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + 1b^4\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in this part is 6. \n\nBut wait, the entire expression isn't just \\((a + b)^4\\); it's multiplied by another expression, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I need to consider that when looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Hmm, so does the second part affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)? Let me think. Since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are variables separate from \\(c\\), when we multiply the two expressions together, the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) will be multiplied by the terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). However, the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but since the problem doesn't specify any particular power of \\(c\\), it's just asking for the coefficient in the \\(a^2b^2\\) term, regardless of what's happening with \\(c\\). \n\nWait, no, that doesn't sound quite right. Let me clarify. When you multiply two expressions together, each term from the first expression gets multiplied by each term from the second expression. So, if I have \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, that doesn't make sense because the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) has multiple terms, each with different powers of \\(c\\). \n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, in other words, when you multiply out the entire expression, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by every term from the second expansion, but since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), it's actually the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire second part. But that would mean the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that can't be, because the problem is probably expecting a numerical coefficient, not an expression. \n\nWait, maybe I misinterpreted the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, it's the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, when you multiply the two expansions, each term in the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part will be multiplied by every term in the second expansion, which includes various powers of \\(c\\). But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. But that doesn't make sense because the second expansion is a polynomial in \\(c\\), and we're treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable. \n\nWait, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the coefficient where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. That is, the constant term with respect to \\(c\\). So, maybe I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product. That would make more sense, because otherwise, the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\), which seems unlikely given the problem statement. So, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), which is the constant term in \\(c\\). \n\nIf that's the case, then I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, first, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, as I found earlier. Now, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let's work on that. \n\nUsing the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, the general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We need to find the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, so we set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). \n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm interpreting the problem correctly. The problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", without mentioning \\(c\\). So, if we're considering the entire expression, which includes variables \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\), then the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would have coefficients that are polynomials in \\(c\\). However, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which could be interpreted as the coefficient when considering all possible powers of \\(c\\). But that doesn't make much sense because the coefficient would then be a polynomial. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), meaning that we sum over all possible coefficients of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for any \\(k\\). But that would be the sum of all coefficients where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2, regardless of \\(c\\). However, in the product, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by every term in the second expansion, which includes different powers of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which would give a coefficient that is a polynomial in \\(c\\). \n\nBut the problem is asking for \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", which suggests that they are treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable and perhaps looking for the coefficient when considering all terms, but that seems unclear. Alternatively, maybe the problem is intended to be interpreted as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the constant term in \\(c\\). \n\nGiven that, I think the intended interpretation is that we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is the constant term with respect to \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nWait, but let me double-check. If we don't fix the power of \\(c\\), then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 times a polynomial in \\(c\\). But that's not a single number, so the problem must be asking for the coefficient when considering a specific power of \\(c\\). Since it's not specified, maybe it's just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), which would be 6 times the entire second expansion. But that seems unlikely because the problem is probably expecting a numerical answer. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is written incorrectly, and it should be \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but the variables are separate, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would indeed be 6 times the entire expansion of the second part. But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, which doesn't make sense as an answer. \n\nWait, perhaps I need to consider that when multiplying the two expressions, the terms are combined, but since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are independent variables, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the same as the coefficient in the first part multiplied by the entire second expression. But that's not the case because each term in the first expression is multiplied by each term in the second, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the entire expansion of the second part. But that can't be right because the coefficient should be a number, not an expression. \n\nI'm getting confused here. Let me try another approach. Maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, treating \\(c\\) as another variable. So, the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\), but the problem is asking for the coefficient, which is a number. Therefore, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the constant term with respect to \\(c\\). \n\nIn that case, as I calculated earlier, the coefficient would be 6 * 20 = 120. Alternatively, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), meaning summing over all coefficients where \\(a^2b^2\\) appears multiplied by any power of \\(c\\), then it would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, 6 * 64 = 384. But that seems like a lot, and I'm not sure if that's what the problem is asking for. \n\nWait, but the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). It doesn't specify anything about \\(c\\), so maybe it's indeed 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which would be a polynomial. But the problem is likely expecting a numerical answer, so I think the intended interpretation is that we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is miswritten, and it's supposed to be \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) and the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). Given that, I think 120 is the correct answer. \n\nTo confirm, let's think about it again. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 20. Therefore, when we multiply these two parts together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, but the only term that contributes to \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is the constant term in the second expansion, which is 20. Therefore, the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nYes, that makes sense. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is 120. Since the problem didn't specify the power of \\(c\\), but given the way it's written, I think this is the intended answer.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6. Next, we find the constant term (coefficient of \\(c^0\\)) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20. Multiplying these together gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\boxed{120}."

Instead, I just need to find the sum of the coefficients from the second expansion because those will multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term, contributing to the overall coefficient. \n\nWait, no, that's not quite right. Actually, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\). So, that means we only care about the terms in the second expansion where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out, leaving a constant term. Because if there's a \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\) term, then the resulting term would have variables, but since we're only interested in \\(a^2b^2\\), the coefficient is the sum of all the coefficients from the second expansion that are constants. \n\nWait, hold on. Actually, the second expansion \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) will produce terms with different powers of \\(c\\). So, when we multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), each term in the second expansion will create a term like \\(a^2b^2 \\times \\text{something}\\). But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), that can't be right. Wait, no, maybe I'm misinterpreting. Let me re-read the problem: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, actually, we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product. That means we're considering all terms in the product, and we're interested in the terms where the variables are exactly \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in other words, each term in the expansion will be a product of a term from the first expansion and a term from the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, each of which is a power of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion multiplied by the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion, because each term in the second expansion contributes a coefficient that multiplies the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. \n\nWait, is that correct? Let me think again. Suppose I have two expressions: \\( (a + b)^4 = A + B + C + D + E \\) where each letter represents a term, and \\( \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = F + G + H + \\dots \\) where each letter represents a term. When I multiply these two, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient of \\(C\\) times the sum of all coefficients in the second expression because \\(C\\) is multiplied by every term in the second expression. So, yes, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expression multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second expression. \n\nSo, in the first expression, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. Now, I need to find the sum of all coefficients in the second expression, which is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). The sum of coefficients in a polynomial is found by setting all variables to 1. So, substituting \\(c = 1\\), we get \\(\\left(1 + 1/1\\right)^6 = (2)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the sum of the coefficients in the second expression is 64. \n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nWait, but hold on a second. Let me double-check that reasoning. Is the sum of the coefficients in the second expression really 64? Let's compute it manually. The second expression is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). The sum of coefficients is when \\(c = 1\\), so as I did before, that's \\(2^6 = 64\\). So, yes, that's correct. \n\nAlternatively, another way to think about it is that each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is of the form \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - k}(1/c)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, the coefficients are \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}\\) for each term. The sum of the coefficients is the sum from \\(k = 0\\) to \\(6\\) of \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}\\), which is \\(2^6 = 64\\). So, that's correct. \n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nWait, but I'm not sure if I'm supposed to consider the entire expansion or if there's a different approach. Let me think again. The problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which comes from the first part, and when multiplied by the second part, which has terms with various powers of \\(c\\). But since the problem is only about \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), the coefficient is just 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expression, which is 64. So, 6 * 64 is 384. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of it as the product of two independent expansions. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) (the constant term) in the second part is the central binomial coefficient. Wait, no, that's not quite right. Wait, in the second part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the constant term is when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. So, let's compute that. \n\nIn the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - k}(1/c)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\\). We want the exponent of \\(c\\) to be zero, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\). So, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). \n\nWait, so if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, that would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the constant term in the second part. Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by the constant term, you get \\(a^2b^2\\) times that constant, so the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nBut wait, that contradicts my earlier conclusion of 384. So, which one is correct? \n\nI think I made a mistake earlier. The problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but in the entire product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by every term in the second expansion, each of which has a different power of \\(c\\). So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then the coefficient would indeed be 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, giving 384. \n\nBut if the problem had asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it would be 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nWait, let me check the original problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" It doesn't specify anything about \\(c\\), so it's just \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nBut now I'm confused because I thought maybe it's only the constant term, but that would be if the problem was asking for a term that includes \\(c^0\\). So, I need to clarify: when the problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", does it mean the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for any \\(k\\), or specifically \\(a^2b^2c^0\\)? \n\nIn algebra, when you're asked for the coefficient of a specific term without any other variables, it usually means that term regardless of other variables. So, in this case, \\(a^2b^2\\) could be multiplied by any power of \\(c\\), but the coefficient is just the numerical factor in front of \\(a^2b^2\\), irrespective of the \\(c\\) part. Therefore, the coefficient would be the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion. \n\nBut wait, no, that's not quite right either. Because when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term is the sum of the products of the coefficients of terms whose variables multiply to give the desired term. So, in this case, we're looking for all terms where the variables are \\(a^2b^2\\) times any power of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial. \n\nWait, but the second polynomial is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which has terms with different powers of \\(c\\). So, when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second polynomial, you get terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), each with their own coefficients. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is actually the sum of all coefficients from the second polynomial, because each term in the second polynomial contributes to a term with \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by some power of \\(c\\). But the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient is 6 * (sum of coefficients in the second polynomial) = 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nWait, but that seems high. Let me think of a simpler case. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^2 (c + 1/c)^1\\). The expansion is \\((a^2 + 2ab + b^2)(c + 1/c)\\). The coefficient of \\(a^2\\) in the product would be 1 * (1 + 1) = 2, because \\(a^2\\) is multiplied by both \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), each contributing a coefficient of 1. Similarly, the coefficient of \\(ab\\) would be 2 * (1 + 1) = 4, and the coefficient of \\(b^2\\) would be 1 * (1 + 1) = 2. \n\nSo, in this simpler case, the coefficient of a specific term in the first polynomial is multiplied by the sum of coefficients in the second polynomial. Therefore, in our original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nBut wait, let me check with another example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^1 (c + 1/c)^1\\). The expansion is \\((a + b)(c + 1/c)\\). The coefficient of \\(a\\) is 1 * (1 + 1) = 2, because \\(a\\) is multiplied by both \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). Similarly, the coefficient of \\(b\\) is 1 * (1 + 1) = 2. So, this seems to confirm that the coefficient of a specific term in the first polynomial is multiplied by the sum of coefficients in the second polynomial. \n\nTherefore, going back to our original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nWait, but earlier I thought that the constant term in the second polynomial is 20, and if I multiply that by 6, I get 120. But that would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). Since the problem didn't specify anything about \\(c\\), I think the correct approach is to consider all possible powers of \\(c\\), so the coefficient is 384. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, which would include all the terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any power of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient is the sum of all such coefficients, which is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nSo, after going through this reasoning, I think the correct answer is 384. \n\nBut just to make sure, let me try expanding a bit more carefully. \n\nThe first expansion is \\((a + b)^4\\), which gives terms up to \\(a^4\\) and \\(b^4\\). The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, as we've established. \n\nThe second expansion is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). The expansion is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - k}(1/c)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, each term has a coefficient of \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}\\) and a power of \\(c\\) of \\(6 - 2k\\). \n\nNow, when we multiply the two expansions together, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, each of which is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be the sum of all the coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by 6. Because each term in the second expansion contributes a coefficient that multiplies the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. \n\nSince the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\), the total coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nTherefore, after carefully considering and checking with examples, I'm confident that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n$\\boxed{384}$"

Simplifying the coefficients, that's \\(1 \\cdot a^4 + 4 \\cdot a^3b + 6 \\cdot a^2b^2 + 4 \\cdot ab^3 + 1 \\cdot b^4\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. \n\nBut wait, the original expression isn't just \\((a + b)^4\\), it's multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I guess the next step is to consider how this multiplication affects the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Let me think. When you multiply two expressions together, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression. So, in order to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I need to consider all the ways that multiplying a term from \\((a + b)^4\\) by a term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) would result in a term that has \\(a^2b^2\\). \n\nBut hold on, the terms in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) involve \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), whereas the terms in \\((a + b)^4\\) involve \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). Since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\), and \\(1/c\\) are different variables, their exponents don't interfere with each other when multiplying. That means that the coefficients of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be the same as the coefficient in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, is that right? Let me make sure.\n\nSo, if I have two polynomials, say \\(P(a, b)\\) and \\(Q(c)\\), then when I multiply them, the coefficient of a specific term in \\(P(a, b)\\) (like \\(a^2b^2\\)) will be multiplied by the entire polynomial \\(Q(c)\\). But in this case, \\(Q(c)\\) is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial in \\(c\\). So, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be 6 (from \\((a + b)^4\\)) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not considering \\(c\\). Wait, no, actually, the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression. So, perhaps I don't need to worry about the \\(c\\) terms because \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\). So, maybe the coefficient remains 6 because the multiplication by the \\(c\\) terms doesn't affect the \\(a^2b^2\\) term.\n\nWait, that doesn't make sense because when you multiply two polynomials, each term is multiplied by every term in the other polynomial. So, actually, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by every term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, I think the coefficient would just be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that can't be right because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, not an expression involving \\(c\\).\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). That is, when you multiply out the entire expression, you might get terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for various \\(k\\), and the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the sum of all coefficients from terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by some power of \\(c\\). So, in other words, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nBut wait, the sum of all coefficients in a polynomial is found by plugging in 1 for all variables. So, if I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = (2)^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 * 64 = 384. Hmm, that seems plausible.\n\nWait, but let me check again. Alternatively, maybe I don't need to sum all the coefficients. Let me think: when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in one polynomial is multiplied by each term in the other polynomial. So, in this case, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and when multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), it becomes 6 times each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which means that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of the coefficients of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Since the sum of the coefficients is 64, as I found earlier, then 6 * 64 = 384. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 384.\n\nBut wait, let me think differently. Maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Perhaps the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, without considering the \\(c\\) terms. That is, it's treating the entire \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) as a scalar multiplier. But that can't be right because \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is a polynomial in \\(c\\), not a constant.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider that \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), so when I multiply by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just the coefficient in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. So, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating \\(c\\) as a variable, so that the coefficient could be a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem didn't specify, so maybe I need to assume that it's asking for the coefficient as a number, considering all terms. Hmm, I'm a bit confused now.\n\nLet me try another approach. Let's expand both parts separately and then see how they multiply. So, as I did before, \\((a + b)^4\\) has a term \\(6a^2b^2\\). The other part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), can be expanded using the binomial theorem as well. Let me do that.\n\n\\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\).\n\nSo, the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{0}c^6 + \\dbinom{6}{1}c^4 + \\dbinom{6}{2}c^2 + \\dbinom{6}{3}c^0 + \\dbinom{6}{4}c^{-2} + \\dbinom{6}{5}c^{-4} + \\dbinom{6}{6}c^{-6}\\). Calculating the coefficients, that's \\(1c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20c^0 + 15c^{-2} + 6c^{-4} + 1c^{-6}\\).\n\nSo, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) from \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), resulting in terms like \\(6a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(6a^2b^2c^4\\), \\(6a^2b^2c^2\\), \\(6a^2b^2\\), \\(6a^2b^2c^{-2}\\), etc.\n\nBut the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, in the product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) can come from multiplying \\(a^2b^2\\) by \\(c^0\\) (which is 1) from the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). From the expansion I did earlier, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, that seems different from my earlier conclusion. So, earlier I thought it was 384, but now I'm getting 120. Which one is correct? Let me check my reasoning.\n\nSo, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. But the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will only come from multiplying \\(a^2b^2\\) by the constant term (i.e., the term with \\(c^0\\)) in the second polynomial. Because if you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by \\(c^k\\) where \\(k \\neq 0\\), you'll get \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), which is a different term. So, the only term in the product that is \\(a^2b^2\\) is when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by the constant term in the second polynomial. Therefore, the coefficient is 6 (from \\(a^2b^2\\)) multiplied by 20 (the coefficient of \\(c^0\\)), giving 120.\n\nThat makes sense. So, my initial thought to multiply by the sum of all coefficients was incorrect because that would include all powers of \\(c\\), but the problem is only asking for the term where the power of \\(c\\) is zero, i.e., the constant term. Therefore, the correct coefficient is 120.\n\nWait, let me confirm this by another method. Alternatively, perhaps I can consider that when you have two polynomials multiplied together, the coefficient of a specific term is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each polynomial. So, in this case, to get \\(a^2b^2\\), you need to take the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first polynomial and multiply it by the constant term from the second polynomial. Since the second polynomial's constant term is 20, as we found, the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, I think the correct answer is 120. I must have made a mistake earlier when I thought about multiplying by the sum of all coefficients. That approach would have given me the coefficient if the problem had asked for the sum of coefficients, but it wasn't the case here.\n\nWait, just to be thorough, let me think about it another way. Let's say I expand the entire product. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) can only come from multiplying \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part by the constant term in the second part. There's no other way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) because any other term in the second polynomial would introduce a power of \\(c\\), which would make the term \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), not just \\(a^2b^2\\). So, yes, only the constant term in the second polynomial contributes to the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the product.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient is indeed 6 (from \\(a^2b^2\\)) multiplied by 20 (from the constant term in the second polynomial), which is 120. So, I think that's the correct answer.\n\nWait, but let me check the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) again to make sure I didn't make a mistake there. The binomial expansion is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\cdot \\dfrac{1}{c}^k\\), which simplifies to \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, when \\(k = 0\\), it's \\(c^6\\), \\(k=1\\) is \\(c^{4}\\), \\(k=2\\) is \\(c^{2}\\), \\(k=3\\) is \\(c^{0}\\), \\(k=4\\) is \\(c^{-2}\\), \\(k=5\\) is \\(c^{-4}\\), and \\(k=6\\) is \\(c^{-6}\\). The coefficients are \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}\\), so for \\(k=3\\), which gives the constant term, it's \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, that's correct.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me think if there's any other way that \\(a^2b^2\\) could appear in the product. Suppose I have terms from both polynomials that could combine to give \\(a^2b^2\\). But since the first polynomial only has \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the second has \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), there's no way for the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) to be affected by the \\(c\\) terms. Therefore, the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) is by taking \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first polynomial and multiplying it by the constant term from the second polynomial. So, yes, 120 is correct.\n\nI think I've gone through this thoroughly. I initially thought I might have to consider all coefficients, but upon re-examining, it's clear that only the constant term in the second polynomial affects the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the product. So, the correct coefficient is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by considering the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from \\((a + b)^4\\) and multiplying it by the constant term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\n1. Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\dbinom{4}{2}a^2b^2 + \\text{other terms} = 6a^2b^2 + \\text{other terms}\n   \\]\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6.\n\n2.

The coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n\n3. Multiply the coefficients from both expansions:\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 20 = 120\n   \\]\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}."

Okay, so that's the first part. Now, the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4\\) times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Hmm, that's only in the first part, right? Because the second part is in terms of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), so when I multiply the two parts together, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of the second part. But wait, the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. Or does it? Let me check the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" Hmm, so it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but in the entire expression, which includes terms with \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, does that mean I need to consider all possible terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any term from the second expansion? Or is it that \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term on its own, and we're considering its coefficient regardless of the \\(c\\) terms? Hmm, I think it's the latter. Because \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term in the first part, and when we multiply by the second part, each term in the first part gets multiplied by each term in the second part. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be the same as the coefficient in the first part, multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. Wait, that doesn't make sense. Maybe I'm misunderstanding. Let me think again.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of the term that has both \\(a^2b^2\\) and some combination of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). But that would complicate things because then we'd have to consider all possible exponents of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). But the problem just says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", so maybe it's considering the entire product, and looking for the term where the variables are \\(a^2b^2\\) times any combination of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). But that seems unlikely because the problem is probably expecting a numerical coefficient, not a term that still has \\(c\\) in it. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting me to consider only the \\(a^2b^2\\) term, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, so the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that seems odd because then the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\), not a single number.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me read the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, perhaps the problem is treating \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\), and \\(1/c\\) as separate variables, and it's asking for the coefficient of the term where the variables are \\(a^2b^2\\) times any combination of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). But that would mean that the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't seem right because the problem is asking for a coefficient, which is typically a number. So maybe I'm misinterpreting the problem.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some specific \\(k\\), but it's not stated. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe the problem is just considering the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating the entire \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) as a single term or factor, so the coefficient would be 6 times the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that seems odd because then the coefficient would be a polynomial, not a number. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, so it's just 6, as that's the coefficient in the first part, and the second part doesn't affect it because we're only looking at the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. But that seems too simplistic because the entire expression is a product of two polynomials, so the \\(a^2b^2\\) term would be multiplied by each term in the second polynomial.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me think differently. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, as we saw earlier. Now, when we multiply this by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) gets multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, which has terms like \\(c^6\\), \\(6c^4\\), \\(15c^2\\), \\(20\\), \\(15c^{-2}\\), \\(6c^{-4}\\), and \\(c^{-6}\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 times the sum of all these terms, but that would give a coefficient that's a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient, which is a number, so perhaps I'm misunderstanding.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where the exponents of \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are 2, 2, and 0 respectively. That would make sense because then the coefficient would be a number. So, perhaps the problem is implicitly asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). Let me check the problem again: it says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\". Hmm, but it's possible that it's considering the entire expression, so \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by some power of \\(c\\), but the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial. But that seems unlikely because the problem is probably expecting a numerical answer.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the entire expression as a product, and it's asking for the coefficient of the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. But in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), because each term in the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part. But that would mean the coefficient is 6 times the sum of the coefficients of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 times \\(2^6 = 64\\), so 6*64=384. But that seems high. Alternatively, maybe the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), treating the entire expression as a product, so the coefficient would be 6 times the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, which doesn't make sense because the problem is likely expecting a number.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think again. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, in the product, each term from \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term from the second part. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. But that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial. But the problem is asking for a coefficient, which is a number, so perhaps I'm misunderstanding.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, so it's just 6, because the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6, and when you multiply by the second part, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, but the coefficient for each of those would be 6 times the coefficient from the second expansion. But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so maybe it's 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. Wait, the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion is when we set \\(c = 1\\), so \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). So, 6 times 64 is 384. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 384. But I'm not sure if that's correct because I'm not sure if that's what the problem is asking.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating the entire \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) as a separate factor, so the coefficient would be 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but that's a polynomial, not a number. So, maybe the problem is expecting the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\). In that case, we would need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is the middle term. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is:\n\n\\[\n\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n\\]\n\nSo, the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0 is when \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), so \\(k = 3\\). The coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire product is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). So, maybe that's the answer. Let me check that again.\n\nSo, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). If we interpret this as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then the coefficient is 6 (from the first expansion) multiplied by 20 (from the second expansion's constant term), giving 120. Alternatively, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, then the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but that's a polynomial, which doesn't make sense as an answer. Therefore, I think the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nWait, but let me make sure. Let me consider the entire expansion. When you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that's a polynomial in \\(c\\), so if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), then it's 6 times the entire expansion, which is a polynomial. But that seems unlikely because the problem is probably expecting a numerical answer. Therefore, I think the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable, so the coefficient would be 6 times the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, which doesn't make sense as an answer. Therefore, I think the correct interpretation is that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nWait, let me confirm that. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 20. Therefore, when you multiply these two parts, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is 6 * 20 = 120. So, that's the answer.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion is found by considering the binomial expansions of each part. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Multiplying these gives 6 * 20 = 120.\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

So, the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is \\(a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). \n\nNow, the problem asks for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Looking at the expansion, the term with \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(6a^2b^2\\), so the coefficient is 6. But wait, the original expression isn't just \\((a + b)^4\\); it's multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I need to consider that as well. \n\nI think I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, which means I need to multiply the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) by the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\), right? So, when I multiply the two expansions together, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by every term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nHowever, since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and this term doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient will just be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, no, that doesn't make sense. Actually, when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. But since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term from the first polynomial and doesn't involve \\(c\\), when multiplied by each term in the second polynomial, it will produce terms involving \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) and \\(a^2b^2c^{-k}\\) for various \\(k\\). But the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, does that mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is just the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)? \n\nWait, no, that might not be correct. Let me think again. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would come from multiplying the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in \\((a + b)^4\\) by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) has a coefficient, and when you multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), you get terms like \\(6a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(6a^2b^2c^4\\), etc., but the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would just be the sum of all coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) multiplied by 6. \n\nWait, that might not be accurate either. Let me clarify. When you have two polynomials multiplied together, say \\(P(a, b) \\times Q(c)\\), the coefficient of a specific term in \\(P(a, b)\\) (like \\(a^2b^2\\)) is multiplied by the entire polynomial \\(Q(c)\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\(P(a, b) \\times Q(c)\\) is the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(P(a, b)\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(Q(c)\\). Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in \\(Q(c)\\), you get terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) with coefficients equal to the coefficients from \\(Q(c)\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the sum of all coefficients in \\(Q(c)\\) multiplied by the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(P(a, b)\\). \n\nBut wait, actually, no. Because in the product, each term in \\(P(a, b)\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(Q(c)\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(P(a, b)\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(Q(c)\\). Because for each term in \\(Q(c)\\), you're adding a multiple of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, if \\(Q(c)\\) has a term \\(k c^n\\), then in the product, it becomes \\(k a^2b^2 c^n\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the sum of all coefficients in \\(Q(c)\\) multiplied by 6, since the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(P(a, b)\\) is 6. \n\nSo, to find the coefficient, I need to calculate the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). How do I find the sum of all coefficients in a polynomial? I remember that the sum of coefficients is found by plugging in 1 for all variables. So, if I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = (1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 64. \n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 (from \\((a + b)^4\\)) multiplied by 64 (the sum of coefficients from the other part), which is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nWait, but let me make sure. Let me think about this again. When I expand \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, resulting in terms like \\(6a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(6a^2b^2c^4\\), \\(6a^2b^2c^2\\), \\(6a^2b^2c^0\\), \\(6a^2b^2c^{-2}\\), etc. So, in the entire product, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 multiplied by the sum of the coefficients of all terms in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nBut wait, when I set \\(c = 1\\), I get the sum of the coefficients, which is 64, as I did earlier. So, 6 * 64 is indeed 384. So, the coefficient is 384. \n\nBut let me verify this another way. Maybe I can compute the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) and find the sum of its coefficients, then multiply by 6. Alternatively, I can use the binomial theorem on \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nUsing the binomial theorem, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). \n\nSo, the terms are: for \\(k=0\\), \\(\\dbinom{6}{0}c^6 = 1c^6\\); \\(k=1\\), \\(\\dbinom{6}{1}c^4 = 6c^4\\); \\(k=2\\), \\(\\dbinom{6}{2}c^2 = 15c^2\\); \\(k=3\\), \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}c^0 = 20\\); \\(k=4\\), \\(\\dbinom{6}{4}c^{-2} = 15c^{-2}\\); \\(k=5\\), \\(\\dbinom{6}{5}c^{-4} = 6c^{-4}\\); \\(k=6\\), \\(\\dbinom{6}{6}c^{-6} = 1c^{-6}\\). \n\nSo, the coefficients are 1, 6, 15, 20, 15, 6, 1. Adding these up: 1 + 6 = 7; 7 + 15 = 22; 22 + 20 = 42; 42 + 15 = 57; 57 + 6 = 63; 63 + 1 = 64. Yep, that's 64. So, the sum of coefficients is indeed 64. \n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me think if there's another way to approach this. Maybe considering the entire expansion and looking for the term \\(a^2b^2\\). But since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are in the first part, and \\(c\\) is in the second part, the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is to take the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part and multiply it by any term from the second part. Since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), any term from the second part will just add a factor involving \\(c\\). But the coefficient is just the product of the coefficients, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nAlternatively, if I were to write the entire product, it would be \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from selecting \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part and any term from the second part. So, the coefficient is 6 multiplied by the sum of the coefficients in the second part, which is 64, giving 384. \n\nWait, another thought: could there be a cross term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is combined with a term from the second part that somehow cancels out the \\(c\\) terms? No, because \\(a^2b^2\\) is separate from \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is just 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nI think that's solid. So, the coefficient is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6. Next, we calculate the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) by setting \\(c = 1\\), resulting in \\(2^6 = 64\\). Multiplying these together gives \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n\\(\\boxed{384}\\)"

    "text": " The expansion would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{0}a^4b^0 + \\dbinom{4}{1}a^3b^1 + \\dbinom{4}{2}a^2b^2 + \\dbinom{4}{3}a^1b^3 + \\dbinom{4}{4}a^0b^4\\). Calculating the coefficients, that would be \\(1a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + 1b^4\\). Okay, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) here is 6. \n\nWait, but the original expression isn't just \\((a + b)^4\\); it's multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I think I need to consider how this multiplication affects the coefficient. Let me denote the first part as \\(A = (a + b)^4\\) and the second part as \\(B = \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the entire expression is \\(A \\times B\\). \n\nNow, when you multiply two expressions, the coefficients of the terms combine. But since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and \\(B\\) is in terms of \\(c\\), which is a different variable, I think that \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\) at all. So, maybe the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(A\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(B\\), but since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), it's just 6 times whatever \\(B\\) is. Wait, but actually, since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient should just be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(B\\), but that might not be correct. Wait, no, actually, when you multiply \\(A\\) and \\(B\\), each term in \\(A\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(B\\). So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I need to consider all the terms in \\(B\\) multiplied by the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from \\(A\\). \n\nWait, but \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term from \\(A\\), and \\(B\\) is a separate expansion. So, when I multiply \\(A\\) and \\(B\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from \\(A\\) will be multiplied by every term in \\(B\\). But since I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), that means I'm looking for the term in \\(A\\) times the term in \\(B\\) that doesn't involve \\(c\\). But wait, \\(B\\) is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), so when expanded, it has terms like \\(c^6\\), \\(c^4\\), \\(c^2\\), \\(1\\), \\(c^{-2}\\), \\(c^{-4}\\), \\(c^{-6}\\), each with their own coefficients. \n\nWait, but if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, and \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), then the only way \\(a^2b^2\\) can appear in the product is if it's multiplied by the constant term in \\(B\\), which is the term where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out, i.e., \\(c^0\\). So, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(B\\), which is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). \n\nAlright, so let me compute the expansion of \\(B = \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem again, this would be \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(1/c\\right)^k\\). Simplifying that, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\times c^{-k} = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, the exponent of \\(c\\) in each term is \\(6 - 2k\\). I need to find the term where the exponent is 0, so set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). \n\nCalculating \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\), which is \\(\\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(B\\) is 20. \n\nNow, going back to the original expression \\(A \\times B\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from \\(A\\) has a coefficient of 6, and it's multiplied by the constant term 20 from \\(B\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). \n\nWait, let me double-check to make sure I didn't make a mistake. So, in \\(A = (a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6, as calculated earlier. In \\(B = \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. When multiplying \\(A\\) and \\(B\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from \\(A\\) is multiplied by every term in \\(B\\), but only the constant term in \\(B\\) (i.e., the term with \\(c^0\\)) will result in a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), so only that term contributes to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, multiplying 6 by 20 gives 120. \n\nWait, but another way to think about it is that the entire product is a product of two independent expansions, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) would be 6 * 20, which is 120. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). Hmm, but in the product, any term involving \\(c\\) wouldn't be part of \\(a^2b^2\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would indeed be 120 because it's the sum of all terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any power of \\(c\\), but since we're only interested in \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), I think I might have made a mistake here. Wait, no, actually, in the product, each term is a combination of terms from \\(A\\) and \\(B\\). So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), it would be the sum of all coefficients where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any term from \\(B\\), but since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the only way \\(a^2b^2\\) can be present in the product is when it's multiplied by the constant term in \\(B\\), which is 20. Therefore, the coefficient is indeed 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nWait, but let me think again. If I have \\(A \\times B\\), then each term in \\(A\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(B\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from \\(A\\) will be multiplied by each term in \\(B\\), which includes \\(c^6\\), \\(c^4\\), \\(c^2\\), 1, \\(c^{-2}\\), \\(c^{-4}\\), \\(c^{-6}\\). So, in the product, we'll have terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), etc. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for any \\(k\\). So, does that mean we're only considering the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by the constant term in \\(B\\), which is 1? Because if we're just looking for \\(a^2b^2\\), without any \\(c\\) terms, then yes, it's only the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by 1 from \\(B\\). So, that would make the coefficient 6 * 20 = 120, as I thought earlier. \n\nAlternatively, if the problem had asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), it would also be 120, but since it's just \\(a^2b^2\\), I think it's the same thing because the only way \\(a^2b^2\\) can appear without any \\(c\\) terms is when it's multiplied by the constant term in \\(B\\). \n\nWait, but let me check if the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) or just \\(a^2b^2\\). The problem says: \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)\". So, it's just \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 * 20 = 120, as I concluded earlier. \n\nBut wait, another way to think about it is that when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each polynomial, provided that their variable parts multiply to the desired term. So, in this case, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\(A\\), and we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which would be the sum over all possible ways to get \\(a^2b^2\\) when multiplying terms from \\(A\\) and \\(B\\). But since \\(B\\) doesn't have any \\(a\\) or \\(b\\) terms, the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) is by taking the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from \\(A\\) and multiplying it by the constant term from \\(B\\). Therefore, the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nI think that makes sense. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120. \n\nWait, just to make sure, let me go through it one more time. \n\nFirst, expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). \n\nNext, expand \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem. The general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - k}(1/c)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\\). We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\). The coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). \n\nNow, when multiplying \\(A\\) and \\(B\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from \\(A\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(B\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), we need to consider how many ways \\(a^2b^2\\) can be formed. Since \\(B\\) doesn't contribute any \\(a\\) or \\(b\\) terms, the only contribution is from the constant term in \\(B\\), which is 20. Therefore, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). \n\nYes, that seems correct. I don't think I made any mistakes in the calculations. So, the final answer should be 120. \n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem for both parts of the expression.\n\nFirst, consider the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n\\]\nThe term containing \\(a^2b^2\\) is:\n\\[\n\\dbinom{4}{2} a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\n\\]\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\nNext, consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem:\n\\[\n\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n\\]\nWe need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0. Setting \\(6 - 2k = 0\\) gives \\(k = 3\\). The coefficient of this term is:\n\\[\n\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\n\\]\n\nWhen multiplying the two expansions, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by the constant term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is:\n\\[\n6 \\times 20 = 120\n\\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}."
