    "text": " \n\nSo, for \\((a + b)^4\\), using the binomial theorem, each term will be \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\\) where \\(k\\) goes from 0 to 4. I'm interested in the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2, which would be when \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). So, let me calculate that term. \n\nThe coefficient here is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). I remember that \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the term is \\(6a^2b^2\\). Got that. \n\nNow, the expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I need to figure out how this part affects the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, but actually, the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, maybe I don't need to worry about the \\(c\\) terms because they are separate variables. Hmm, let me think. \n\nWait, no, that's not quite right. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when you multiply these two expansions together, each term from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term from the second expansion. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which comes from the first part, I might not need to consider the \\(c\\) terms because they don't affect the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). \n\nWait, but actually, when you multiply the two expansions, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part will be multiplied by every term in the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be \\(6\\) times the sum of all the coefficients in the second expansion. But that doesn't make sense because the second expansion is in terms of \\(c\\), which is a different variable. So, actually, maybe the \\(a^2b^2\\) term is just multiplied by the entire second expansion, which is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. \n\nWait, that can't be right because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that includes both \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), but the second part is in terms of \\(c\\). So, actually, when you multiply the two expressions together, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, each of which is a power of \\(c\\). Therefore, in the product, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) will be \\(6\\) times the sum of all the coefficients in the second expansion. But that seems a bit confusing. \n\nWait, let me clarify. When you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum of the products of the coefficients of terms whose variables multiply to give that specific term. In this case, since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are in one polynomial and \\(c\\) is in the other, the terms in the product will have variables like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) where \\(k\\) can be various exponents. But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would mean that we're considering terms where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero because \\(c^0 = 1\\). So, in other words, we need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire product. \n\nSo, that means in the first polynomial, we have the term \\(6a^2b^2\\), and in the second polynomial, we need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. Let me find that. The second polynomial is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me expand that using the binomial theorem as well. \n\nSo, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying that, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m} = \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). \n\nWe need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero is when \\(m = 3\\), and the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). \n\nCalculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). So, the term is \\(20c^0 = 20\\). \n\nNow, going back to the original problem, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first polynomial is multiplied by this constant term \\(20\\) from the second polynomial. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). \n\nWait, let me double-check that. So, in the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. In the second part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the constant term (where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero) is 20. When you multiply these two parts together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by 20, so the coefficient becomes 6 * 20 = 120. That seems correct. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of the entire expression as \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But wait, no, that's not quite right because the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) would be when \\(c = 1\\), so substituting \\(c = 1\\), we get \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). But then, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 * 64 = 384, which contradicts my previous result. \n\nWait, so now I'm confused. Which approach is correct? \n\nLet me think again. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). But in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first polynomial will be multiplied by each term in the second polynomial, which includes various powers of \\(c\\). Therefore, in the product, \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by \\(c^6\\), \\(c^4\\), \\(c^2\\), \\(c^0\\), \\(c^{-2}\\), \\(c^{-4}\\), and \\(c^{-6}\\), each with their respective coefficients. \n\nBut the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would include all these terms because \\(a^2b^2\\) is being multiplied by each of these \\(c\\) terms. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the sum of the products of the coefficients from the first polynomial and the coefficients from the second polynomial. \n\nWait, but that's not right either because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would be a term that has \\(a^2b^2\\) and any power of \\(c\\). But if the question is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, then it's actually considering all possible \\(c\\) terms, which would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial. \n\nBut that would mean substituting \\(c = 1\\) in the second polynomial to get the sum of its coefficients. So, \\(\\left(1 + 1/1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 * 64 = 384. But earlier, I thought it was 120. So, which is correct? \n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again. It says: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, regardless of the exponent of \\(c\\). That is, all terms where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2, regardless of the exponent of \\(c\\). \n\nSo, in that case, the coefficient would be the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the sum of all coefficients from the second part, which is 64, as calculated earlier. So, 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nBut wait, that seems too large. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is a specific term where \\(c\\) is also raised to the zero power. In that case, the coefficient would be 6 * 20 = 120, as I originally thought. \n\nI think I need to clarify what the problem is asking. The problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\". In algebra, when you're asked for the coefficient of a specific term, it usually refers to the term where the exponents of the variables are exactly those specified, regardless of other variables. But in this case, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by various powers of \\(c\\), so in the product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually be a part of multiple terms, each with different powers of \\(c\\). \n\nWait, but actually, no. When you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial, so the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial, which includes \\(c^6\\), \\(c^4\\), etc. So, in the product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is part of terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), etc. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would actually be the sum of the coefficients of all these terms. \n\nBut wait, that's not correct because the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is typically the coefficient when the exponents of all variables are exactly specified. So, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), it's actually referring to the coefficient when considering all possible exponents of \\(c\\), which would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is a specific term. But the problem doesn't specify the exponent of \\(c\\), so I think it's referring to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), meaning that it's 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nBut I'm not entirely sure. Let me try another approach. Let me consider the entire expression as a product of two polynomials. The first polynomial is in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the second is in \\(c\\). When you multiply them, the variables are independent. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient from the first polynomial times the entire second polynomial. Therefore, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nWait, but that doesn't seem right because the second polynomial is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which when expanded, has terms with positive and negative exponents of \\(c\\). So, if I multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by this polynomial, I get \\(a^2b^2 \\times \\left(c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15c^{-2} + 6c^{-4} + c^{-6}\\right)\\). So, in this product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each of these \\(c\\) terms, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), etc. \n\nBut the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term with \\(a^2b^2\\) and \\(c^0\\). So, in this case, the coefficient would be the coefficient from the first part times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part, which is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nWait, so now I'm getting two different answers depending on how I interpret the problem. If the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), it's 384. If it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), it's 120. \n\nI think I need to look at the problem again. It says: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, the way it's phrased, it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), without specifying anything about \\(c\\). In algebra, when you're asked for the coefficient of a term with certain variables, it's usually considering all possible exponents of the other variables. So, in this case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the sum of all coefficients where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any power of \\(c\\). \n\nBut that's not standard. Usually, the coefficient of a term is specific to that term. So, if the term is \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), the coefficient is specific to that \\(k\\). But the problem isn't specifying \\(k\\), so it's ambiguous. \n\nWait, but in the context of the problem, maybe it's intended to consider only the term where \\(c\\) is also squared or something. But no, that's not specified. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is written in a way that the entire expression is a product, and we're to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. \n\nWait, but that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 6 * 64 = 384. But that seems high. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, which would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients of the second polynomial, which is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nBut I'm not entirely sure. Let me check an example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^1 \\times (c + 1/c)^1 = (a + b)(c + 1/c)\\). The coefficient of \\(a\\) would be \\(1 \\times (c + 1/c)\\), so the coefficient of \\(a\\) is \\(c + 1/c\\). But that's not a numerical coefficient. So, perhaps in this problem, since we're dealing with polynomials, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be a numerical coefficient, meaning that we need to find the coefficient when considering all possible \\(c\\) terms. \n\nWait, but in the example, \\((a + b)(c + 1/c)\\), the term \\(a\\) is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial, so the coefficient of \\(a\\) is \\(c + 1/c\\), which is not a numerical coefficient. So, perhaps in this problem, the coefficient is intended to be a numerical coefficient, meaning that we need to consider the term where \\(c\\) is also raised to the zero power, i.e., the constant term. So, in that case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nI think that's the correct interpretation. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, which would be the coefficient when the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2, and the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. So, it's 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nLet me confirm this by expanding the expressions step by step. \n\nFirst, expand \\((a + b)^4\\):\n\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\n\\]\n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6.\n\nNext, expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):\n\nUsing the binomial theorem:\n\n\\[\n\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n\\]\n\nSo, the terms are:\n\n- \\(m=0\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{0}c^6 = 1 \\cdot c^6\\)\n- \\(m=1\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{1}c^4 = 6c^4\\)\n- \\(m=2\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{2}c^2 = 15c^2\\)\n- \\(m=3\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}c^0 = 20\\)\n- \\(m=4\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{4}c^{-2} = 15c^{-2}\\)\n- \\(m=5\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{5}c^{-4} = 6c^{-4}\\)\n- \\(m=6\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{6}c^{-6} = 1c^{-6}\\)\n\nSo, the expansion is:\n\n\\[\nc^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15c^{-2} + 6c^{-4} + c^{-6}\n\\]\n\nNow, when we multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, resulting in:\n\n- \\(6a^2b^2c^6\\)\n- \\(36a^2b^2c^4\\)\n- \\(90a^2b^2c^2\\)\n- \\(120a^2b^2\\)\n- \\(90a^2b^2c^{-2}\\)\n- \\(36a^2b^2c^{-4}\\)\n- \\(6a^2b^2c^{-6}\\)\n\nSo, in the product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) appears as part of each of these terms, each with different exponents of \\(c\\). However, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which typically refers to the term where the exponents of all variables are exactly specified. Since the problem doesn't specify the exponent of \\(c\\), it's ambiguous. \n\nBut in most cases, when the problem asks for the coefficient of a term like \\(a^2b^2\\), it's referring to the term where the exponents of the other variables are zero. So, in this case, the term \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which has a coefficient of 120. \n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by considering the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) and multiplying it by the constant term (where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero) from the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\n1. Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is 6.\n2. Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem and find the constant term, which is 20.\n3. Multiply these coefficients together: \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\boxed{120}."

    "text": " \n\nSo, \\((a + b)^4\\) would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{0}a^4b^0 + \\dbinom{4}{1}a^3b^1 + \\dbinom{4}{2}a^2b^2 + \\dbinom{4}{3}a^1b^3 + \\dbinom{4}{4}a^0b^4\\). Calculating the coefficients, that would be \\(1a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + 1b^4\\). Okay, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in this part is 6. \n\nBut wait, the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I need to consider that when looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Hmm, so does that mean I need to multiply the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) by the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)? But I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, perhaps I can separate the two parts and find how they interact. \n\nLet me think: since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are variables independent of \\(c\\), the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) won't be affected by the terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, when I multiply the two expansions together, the coefficients for the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms will multiply by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nBut wait, since I'm only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term in the first expansion, I can think of the overall coefficient as the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. But actually, when multiplying two polynomials, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. So, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by every term in the second expansion. \n\nBut since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\) at all, that means the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product will just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. Wait, no, that doesn't make sense because when you multiply, each term is combined with each term from the other expansion. \n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try another approach. Since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term that comes from the first part, and the second part is a polynomial in \\(c\\), when I multiply them together, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will be multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients in the second part. \n\nBut that can't be right because the second part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which when expanded, has terms with different powers of \\(c\\). However, when we multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, each of these products will be separate terms in the final expansion. But the original problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which suggests that it's only considering the \\(a^2b^2\\) term regardless of the power of \\(c\\). \n\nWait, no, that doesn't make sense. Let me read the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, actually, the problem is asking for the coefficient of the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product. But in the product, each term will have both \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) parts and \\(c\\) parts. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Because each term in the second part will contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when multiplied by the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part. \n\nSo, that means I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and then multiply it by the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But how do I find the sum of all coefficients in the second part? \n\nI remember that the sum of all coefficients in a polynomial is found by plugging in 1 for all variables. So, if I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) becomes \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the sum of all coefficients in the second part is 64. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 64 (the sum of coefficients from the second part). So, 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nWait, but let me double-check that. Is that correct? Because when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in the factors. But in this case, since we're looking for \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first polynomial will be multiplied by every term in the second polynomial, each contributing a different power of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial. \n\nYes, that makes sense. So, the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial is indeed 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 384.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in calculating the sum of coefficients. So, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), when \\(c = 1\\), is indeed \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, that part is correct. And the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6, from the binomial expansion. So, 6 * 64 is 384. \n\nAlternatively, another way to think about it is that when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a term is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each polynomial. But in this case, since \\(a^2b^2\\) is only in the first polynomial, and the second polynomial is multiplied entirely, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 64.

Calculating the coefficients, that would be \\(1a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + 1b^4\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in this part is 6. \n\nBut wait, the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term is part of the product of these two expansions. However, I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and I notice that this term doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\). So, does that mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just 6? Or is there more to it?\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product. But since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are only in the first part of the product, and the second part is in terms of \\(c\\), when we multiply them, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), right?\n\nWait, no, that doesn't seem quite right. Let me think again. When we multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum of the products of the coefficients of terms that multiply together to give that specific term. But in this case, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\), so when we multiply it by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each of those terms will contribute a multiple of \\(a^2b^2\\) times something involving \\(c\\). But since the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term without \\(c\\), that would only happen if the term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is a constant term, i.e., the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. Because otherwise, when we multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by a term with \\(c^k\\) or \\(c^{-k}\\), the result would have \\(c^k\\) or \\(c^{-k}\\), and thus the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms would only come from the constant term in the second expansion.\n\nSo, that means the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, now I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nTo find the constant term, I can again use the binomial theorem. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k\\). Simplifying each term, that's \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} c^{-k} = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). \n\nWe want the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, so we set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\), which is 20. \n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Therefore, going back to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 (from the first expansion) multiplied by 20 (from the constant term in the second expansion), which is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nWait, but let me double-check that. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 20. So when you multiply these two parts together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, but only the constant term contributes to a term without \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is indeed 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nAlternatively, another way to think about it is that the entire expression is a product of two polynomials. When you multiply them, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the sum of all products of coefficients from each polynomial that result in \\(a^2b^2\\). But since the second polynomial doesn't have any \\(a\\) or \\(b\\) terms, the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) is to take the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first polynomial and multiply it by the constant term from the second polynomial. So, that would just be 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nWait, is that correct? Let me confirm. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^4\\) times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Each term in the first expansion is \\(a^{4 - k}b^k\\) and each term in the second is \\(c^{6 - m}c^{-m}\\) where \\(m\\) is from 0 to 6. So, when you multiply a term from the first expansion by a term from the second, you get \\(a^{4 - k}b^k c^{6 - 2m}\\). \n\nNow, to get a term that's just \\(a^2b^2\\), the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) must be 2 each, so in the first expansion, we have \\(a^{4 - k}b^k\\). Setting \\(4 - k = 2\\), we get \\(k = 2\\), and \\(k = 2\\) also gives \\(b^2\\). So, the coefficient from the first part is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). \n\nIn the second part, to get a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), we need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be zero, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which gives \\(m = 3\\), as I found earlier. The coefficient here is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). \n\nTherefore, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is \\(6 \\times 20 \\times a^2b^2c^0 = 120a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient is indeed 120. \n\nI think that makes sense. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem.\n\nFirst, we expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n\\]\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in this expansion is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n\nNext, we need to find the constant term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem:\n\\[\n\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n\\]\nWe need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, which occurs when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(m = 3\\). The coefficient of this term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficients from the two expansions:\n\\[\n6 \\times 20 = 120\n\\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

Since the exponent of \\(b\\) is \\(k\\), then \\(k = 2\\). So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) will be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). \n\nCalculating \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\), that's \\(\\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\).

I notice that this part involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), but since I'm only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I don't think the second part affects the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). So, maybe I just need to consider the entire second part as a constant with respect to \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). \n\nWait, but let me think again. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, which is \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, actually, the entire expression is a product of two binomials, each raised to a power. So, when I expand both, each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nBut since I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I can separate the two parts. The reason is that the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms are in one part, and the \\(c\\) terms are in the other. So, when I multiply, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will come from the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by any term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because the \\(c\\) terms don't affect the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). \n\nWait, no, that's not quite right. Let me clarify. The entire product is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when I expand each part, I'll have terms like \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part, and terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) from the second part. When I multiply these together, each term from the first part will be multiplied by each term from the second part. \n\nBut since I'm only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I need to consider all the terms in the product that result in \\(a^2b^2\\). That means, for each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), the resulting term will have \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by some power of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). \n\nWait, but the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Maybe I just need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and then multiply it by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because when you multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), the coefficient will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. \n\nBut that doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would mean that the entire expression is a product, and the \\(a^2b^2\\) term is being multiplied by some combination of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). Wait, no, actually, no. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be the term from the first expansion, \\(a^2b^2\\), multiplied by any term from the second expansion, which is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part. \n\nWait, that seems a bit confusing. Let me try to think differently. The entire expression is a product, so when you expand it, each term will be a product of a term from \\((a + b)^4\\) and a term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, to get the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I need to find all the terms where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2 each, regardless of the exponents of \\(c\\). \n\nBut actually, no, because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression. So, the coefficient would be the coefficient from the first part, \\(6\\), multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part, because each term in the second part is being multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). \n\nWait, that doesn't seem right. Let me think again. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because each term in the second expansion is being multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). \n\nSo, first, I found that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. Now, I need to find the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The sum of all coefficients in a polynomial is found by setting all variables to 1. So, if I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = (2)^6 = 64\\). \n\nTherefore, the sum of all coefficients in the second part is 64. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). \n\nWait, but let me check that again. If I have \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is indeed the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But actually, when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each polynomial. \n\nWait, no, that's not exactly correct. Because in this case, the terms in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) don't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), so when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by any term in the second expansion, you just get \\(a^2b^2\\) times that term. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part. \n\nSo, that would be 6 times 64, which is 384. \n\nBut wait, let me make sure. Let's take a simpler example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Let's compute this. \n\nFirst, \\((a + b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2\\). Then, \\((c + 1/c)^1 = c + 1/c\\). So, multiplying them together, we get:\n\n\\(a^2(c + 1/c) + 2ab(c + 1/c) + b^2(c + 1/c)\\).\n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) would be 1 times (c + 1/c), but if we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), that would be the sum of coefficients in the second part, which is 2. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) in the product is 1 * 2 = 2. Similarly, the coefficient of \\(ab\\) would be 2 * 2 = 4, and the coefficient of \\(b^2\\) would be 1 * 2 = 2. \n\nSo, in this example, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) (if it existed) would be the coefficient from the first part times the sum of coefficients in the second part. But in the original problem, since we're only looking for \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term from the first part, and it's multiplied by every term in the second part, the coefficient becomes 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of it as the entire product being \\((a + b)^4\\) times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), so when you expand it, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the same as the coefficient in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of the second part. Therefore, the coefficient is 6 times 64, which is 384. \n\nI think that makes sense. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), resulting in \\(2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n\\boxed{384}"

So, to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I need to consider all the ways that multiplying terms from \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) can result in \\(a^2b^2\\).

So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I need to consider all the terms in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) that, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), still result in \\(a^2b^2\\). But since the second part doesn't have \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), it's just a constant multiplier for the entire expression. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 multiplied by whatever the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is. \n\nWait, no, that might not be right. Let me think again. If I have two expressions multiplied together, the coefficients of the terms in the product are obtained by multiplying the coefficients of the terms in each expression. But in this case, since \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) doesn't have any \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), all the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms come from the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\). So, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the product would be the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by every term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), the only term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) that would affect it is the constant term (i.e., the term where the power of \\(c\\) is zero). So, the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nWait, but let me make sure. Let me think about how the product works. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When you expand this, each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first part, and it gets multiplied by each term in the second expansion. However, since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is independent of \\(c\\), we need to consider only those terms in the second expansion that are constants (i.e., \\(c^0\\)), because multiplying by \\(c^k\\) would change the term into \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), which is not the same as \\(a^2b^2\\). So, only the constant term in the second expansion will contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the overall product.\n\nSo, now I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me expand this using the binomial theorem as well. The expansion is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying each term, that's \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m} = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). \n\nWe need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, so we set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). So, the constant term is when \\(m = 3\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} c^{0} = \\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). \n\nSo, the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the constant term from the second part, which is 20. So, 6 times 20 is 120. \n\nWait, but let me double-check that. So, \\((a + b)^4\\) gives a coefficient of 6 for \\(a^2b^2\\), and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) has a constant term of 20, so when you multiply these together, the coefficient becomes 6 * 20 = 120. That seems right. \n\nAlternatively, I can think of the entire expression as the product of two independent expansions. Since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), their coefficients are independent. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just the product of the coefficients from each part where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are satisfied. So, yes, 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but just to make sure I didn't make any mistakes in calculating the binomial coefficients. For \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\), which is 6. Correct. For \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the constant term is when the exponent is zero, which occurs at m=3, and the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\), which is 20. So, 6 * 20 = 120. That seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can consider the entire expression as a product and think about how the terms combine, but I think the approach is solid. Since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the only way it can be affected is by multiplying it by the constant term in the second expansion. So, the coefficient is indeed 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but hold on. Let me think about the variables again. If I have \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), when I multiply them together, the variables are independent. So, \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term in the first part, and it's multiplied by each term in the second part. But since the second part doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), the only way \\(a^2b^2\\) can be part of the product is by multiplying by the constant term in the second part. So, that's correct. Therefore, the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nI think that's the right answer. Let me just recap: The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 20, so the coefficient in the product is 6 * 20 = 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is found by first determining the coefficient in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplying it by the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20. Thus, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\boxed{120}."

Calculating the coefficients, that would be \\(1 \\cdot a^4 + 4 \\cdot a^3b + 6 \\cdot a^2b^2 + 4 \\cdot ab^3 + 1 \\cdot b^4\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in this part is 6. \n\nNow, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I think I need to consider how multiplying by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) affects the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, but actually, since the variables \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are only in the first part, and \\(c\\) is only in the second part, maybe they don't interfere with each other. So, the terms in \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) won't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. \n\nLet me think again. So, when you multiply two polynomials together, each term from the first polynomial is multiplied by each term from the second polynomial. But in this case, since the variables are different, the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) will only be multiplied by constants from the second part. So, maybe the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, that doesn't make sense because the second part is also a polynomial in \\(c\\), so when you multiply, each term will be a product of a term from the first expansion and a term from the second. \n\nBut since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), maybe we can treat the second part as a constant when considering only the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. Wait, no, that's not correct. Because the second part is multiplied by the first, so each term in the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part. So, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part will be multiplied by every term in the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part. \n\nWait, but that would mean the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But is that right? Let me think. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Since the variables \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), the product will have terms like \\(a^k b^m c^n\\) and \\(a^k b^m c^{-n}\\), but since we're only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), we can sum all the coefficients from the second expansion, because each term in the second expansion will multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nWait, let me check that. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, as I found earlier. Then, when we multiply by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term is 6, and it's multiplied by every term in the second expansion, which has terms like \\(c^6\\), \\(6c^4\\), \\(15c^2\\), \\(20\\), \\(15c^{-2}\\), \\(6c^{-4}\\), \\(c^{-6}\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients of all these terms. \n\nWait, but the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\). So, substituting \\(c = 1\\) into \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion is 64. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times 64, which is 384. \n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. Because when you have different variables, the coefficients in the product are the products of the coefficients from each part. So, in this case, since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are only in the first part, and \\(c\\) is only in the second, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) would indeed be the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the sum of the coefficients from the second part. Because each term in the second part is multiplied by the \\(a^2b^2\\) term, so the total contribution is 6 times the sum of the coefficients of the second part. \n\nAlternatively, another way to think about it is that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, yes, that would be 6 times 64, which is 384. \n\nWait, but let me check if that's correct. Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the second expansion doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be the same as in the first part, but multiplied by the entire second expansion. But that doesn't make sense because the second expansion isn't a constant. Hmm, maybe I'm confusing something here. \n\nWait, another approach: the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when you expand this product, each term will be a product of a term from the first expansion and a term from the second. So, for the term \\(a^2b^2\\), it's multiplied by every possible term from the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) (which is 6) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nAnd as I thought earlier, the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by plugging in \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\(2^6 = 64\\). So, 6 times 64 is 384. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 384. \n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in considering the variables. Since the second part is in terms of \\(c\\), and the first part is in terms of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), when you multiply them, the variables don't interfere. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is indeed the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can think of it as the coefficient being 6 times the sum of the coefficients of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, 6 times 64 is 384. \n\nWait, but just to double-check, let me consider a simpler case. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^1 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, expanding, it's \\((a + b)(c + 1/c)\\). The coefficient of \\(a^1b^0\\) is 1, and the sum of coefficients in the second part is 2, so the coefficient of \\(a^1b^0\\) in the product would be 1 times 2, which is 2. Let me see: \\((a + b)(c + 1/c) = a c + a/c + b c + b/c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a\\) (which is \\(a^1b^0\\)) is c + 1/c, which is not a constant. Wait, but in this case, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^1b^0\\), it's actually (c + 1/c), so it's not a constant. Hmm, so maybe my earlier approach is wrong. \n\nWait, that's a problem. Because in the simple case, the coefficient of \\(a^1b^0\\) is not just 1 times the sum of coefficients in the second part, because the second part is not a constant. So, perhaps I'm making a mistake here. \n\nWait, so maybe I should think differently. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all the terms in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But in reality, when you multiply, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the sum of all coefficients in the second part. But in the simple case, that didn't hold because the coefficient wasn't a constant. \n\nWait, but in the simple case, \\((a + b)(c + 1/c)\\), the coefficient of \\(a^1b^0\\) is (c + 1/c), which is not a constant. So, perhaps my initial approach is incorrect. So, maybe I'm not supposed to multiply by the sum of the coefficients, but rather, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just 6, and the \\(c\\) terms are separate. \n\nWait, but that can't be right either because the entire product would have terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), etc. So, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then it's the sum of all coefficients of \\(a^2b^2c^n\\) for any \\(n\\). So, that would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). \n\nWait, so in the simple case, the coefficient of \\(a^1b^0\\) would be the sum of the coefficients of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), which is 2, so the coefficient would be 1 * 2 = 2. But when I expand \\((a + b)(c + 1/c)\\), the coefficient of \\(a c\\) is 1, and the coefficient of \\(a/c\\) is also 1, so the total coefficient for \\(a\\) terms is \\(c + 1/c\\), which is not a constant. So, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question. \n\nWait, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), meaning that we sum over all possible powers of \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without considering \\(c\\), which would be 6, but that seems unlikely because the entire expression includes \\(c\\) terms. \n\nWait, let me read the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, that would mean we need to consider all terms where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2 and 2, respectively, and sum their coefficients across all possible exponents of \\(c\\). \n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). As we found earlier, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 64. So, 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nWait, but let me confirm this with another approach. Let's consider that \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) are independent of each other, so when you multiply them, the coefficients multiply. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6, and the entire second part is a polynomial in \\(c\\), so when you multiply, each term in the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the sum of the coefficients of all terms in the second part, which is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can think of it as the coefficient being 6 multiplied by the sum of the coefficients of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nWait, but to make sure, let me compute the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) another way. The sum of the coefficients is obtained by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\), which matches what I found earlier. So, that seems correct. \n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nWait, but let me think again about the simple case to see if this approach holds. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^1 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). The coefficient of \\(a^1b^0\\) is 1, and the sum of coefficients in the second part is 2. So, 1 * 2 = 2. But when I expand, \\((a + b)(c + 1/c) = a c + a/c + b c + b/c\\). The coefficient of \\(a c\\) is 1, and the coefficient of \\(a/c\\) is also 1, so the total coefficient for \\(a\\) terms is \\(c + 1/c\\), which is not a constant. So, in this case, the approach of multiplying by the sum of coefficients gives 2, but the actual coefficient is \\(c + 1/c\\), which is a variable expression. \n\nWait, so that suggests that my initial approach is incorrect. Because in the simple case, the coefficient isn't a constant; it's a function of \\(c\\). So, perhaps in the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is not a constant but a function of \\(c\\), but the problem is asking for the coefficient regardless of \\(c\\), which would mean summing over all possible \\(c\\) terms. \n\nWait, but in the problem, it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), without specifying any particular power of \\(c\\). So, maybe it's considering all terms where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2 and 2, respectively, regardless of the exponent of \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients of all terms in the second expansion, which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), but it's not specified. Hmm, the problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", so I think it's considering all terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present, regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times 64, which is 384. \n\nWait, but in the simple case, if I set \\(c = 1\\), then the coefficient of \\(a^1b^0\\) would be 2, which matches the sum of coefficients approach. So, perhaps in the problem, the answer is indeed 384. \n\nWait, let me try another approach. Let's consider that the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first part, and it's multiplied by every term in the second part. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part (which is 6) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part. \n\nSince the sum of the coefficients in the second part is 64, as we found earlier, the total coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nTherefore, after considering all these points, I think the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is 384.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break down the problem into two parts:\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term containing \\(a^2b^2\\) is when \\(k = 2\\):\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} a^{2}b^{2} = 6a^2b^2\n   \\]\n   So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in this part is 6.\n\n2. **Evaluate the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   The sum of the coefficients in a polynomial is found by setting all variables to 1.

So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6.\n\nNow, the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I need to consider how this multiplication affects the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, but actually, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is from the first part, and the second part is in terms of \\(c\\). So, when I multiply the two expressions together, the \\(c\\) terms won't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms.

Let me think about how to find that. Again, using the binomial theorem, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying the exponents, that becomes \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m - m} = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero is when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which gives \\(m = 3\\). So, the constant term is when \\(m = 3\\), and its coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Let me calculate that. \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20.\n\nNow, putting it all together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the two coefficients I found: 6 (from \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\)) and 20 (the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)). So, 6 multiplied by 20 is 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120.\n\nWait, let me double-check to make sure I didn't make a mistake. So, for \\((a + b)^4\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed the middle term, which is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\\). Correct. Then, for \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the constant term occurs when the exponent on \\(c\\) is zero, which is when \\(m = 3\\), so \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying 6 and 20 gives 120. That seems right. I don't see any errors in the reasoning. So, I think the coefficient is 120.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break down the problem into two parts using the binomial theorem.\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\):**\n   - Using the binomial theorem, the general term is \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\\).\n   - The term where \\(a^2b^2\\) occurs is when \\(k = 2\\).\n   - Coefficient: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n\n2. **Find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   - The general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\).\n   - The constant term occurs when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which gives \\(m = 3\\).\n   - Coefficient: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n\n3. **Multiply the coefficients:**\n   - The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer:** \\(\\boxed{120}\\)"

    "text": " \n\nSo, for \\((a + b)^4\\), the expansion would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{0}a^4b^0 + \\dbinom{4}{1}a^3b^1 + \\dbinom{4}{2}a^2b^2 + \\dbinom{4}{3}a^1b^3 + \\dbinom{4}{4}a^0b^4\\). Calculating the coefficients, that's \\(1a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + 1b^4\\). Okay, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in this part is 6. \n\nBut wait, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I need to consider both parts. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is only present in the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), right? Because the second part is only in terms of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), so when I multiply them together, the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms won't interact with the \\(c\\) terms. \n\nSo, does that mean the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just 6, because the second part doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms? Wait, but actually, when you multiply two expressions together, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But hold on, no, that's not quite right. Because the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all the coefficients from the second part, right? Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by every term in the second expansion, each term adds a coefficient, so the total coefficient would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nWait, but actually, no. Because the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of what happens with \\(c\\). So, when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part gets multiplied by every term in the second part. So, each term in the second part will contribute to the overall coefficient. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, the coefficient would be the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all coefficients from the second part, because each term in the second part has a coefficient, and when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), they all contribute to the overall coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product.\n\nWait, but let me think again. If I have \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part, and then I multiply it by each term in the second part, which is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), then each term in the second part will have a coefficient and a power of \\(c\\). So, when I multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term, I'll get terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2c^{-k}\\). But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, actually, every term in the expansion of the second part will contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part.\n\nWait, but that doesn't sound right because the sum of all coefficients in the second part would be when \\(c = 1\\). So, if I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) becomes \\((1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of all coefficients in the second part is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 64 (sum of coefficients from the second part), giving 384.\n\nWait, but that seems high. Let me check again. So, the first part's coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. The second part, when expanded, has terms with coefficients, and each of those coefficients will multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. So, the total coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would indeed be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which is 64. So, 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of it as the entire expression being the product of two independent expansions. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the sum of all coefficients in the second part because each term in the second part contributes a coefficient when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, yes, 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me think if there's another way to approach this. Maybe I can consider that the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), can be expanded using the binomial theorem as well. So, \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). Therefore, when I multiply this by \\(a^2b^2\\), each term becomes \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} a^2b^2 c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the sum over all k of \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}\\), because each term contributes \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}\\) to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\).\n\nSo, the sum of \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}\\) for k from 0 to 6 is equal to \\(2^6 = 64\\), as I thought earlier. Therefore, the coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me confirm this by calculating the sum of the coefficients in the second part. The sum of the coefficients in a polynomial is found by substituting 1 for each variable. So, in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), substituting \\(c = 1\\) gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\), which matches the earlier result.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is indeed 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me check if I'm not making a mistake here. Because sometimes when you have multiple variables, you have to consider cross terms, but in this case, since the two parts are in different variables, \\(a, b\\) and \\(c\\), their expansions are independent. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is just the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and the sum of all coefficients in the second part. So, 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, if I were to write out the entire expansion, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part would be multiplied by each term in the second part, each contributing their own coefficient, so the total coefficient would indeed be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second part.\n\nTherefore, I think the coefficient is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(2^6 = 64\\). Multiplying these gives \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\boxed{384}."

    "text": " \n\nSo, for \\((a + b)^4\\), the expansion would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{0}a^4b^0 + \\dbinom{4}{1}a^3b^1 + \\dbinom{4}{2}a^2b^2 + \\dbinom{4}{3}a^1b^3 + \\dbinom{4}{4}a^0b^4\\). Calculating the coefficients, that would be \\(1a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + 1b^4\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) here is 6. \n\nWait, but the original expression isn't just \\((a + b)^4\\); it's multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I can't just stop here. I need to consider the entire product. Hmm, so I think I should first find the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) as well, and then see how the multiplication affects the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). \n\nLet me tackle the second part: \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Again, using the binomial theorem, this would expand to \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying each term, that becomes \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). \n\nSo, the exponents of \\(c\\) will be \\(6 - 2m\\) for \\(m = 0\\) to \\(6\\). Let me write out all the terms to make sure I understand. \n\nWhen \\(m = 0\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{0}c^{6} = 1 \\cdot c^6\\)\nWhen \\(m = 1\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{1}c^{4} = 6c^4\\)\nWhen \\(m = 2\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{2}c^{2} = 15c^2\\)\nWhen \\(m = 3\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}c^{0} = 20\\)\nWhen \\(m = 4\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{4}c^{-2} = 15c^{-2}\\)\nWhen \\(m = 5\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{5}c^{-4} = 6c^{-4}\\)\nWhen \\(m = 6\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{6}c^{-6} = 1c^{-6}\\)\n\nSo, the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15c^{-2} + 6c^{-4} + c^{-6}\\). \n\nNow, going back to the original problem: \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the entire expression is the product of these two expansions. But wait, I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Hmm, so perhaps I don't need to multiply all the terms. Maybe I can find the part of the product that contributes to \\(a^2b^2\\). \n\nSince \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are variables separate from \\(c\\), the terms involving \\(c\\) won't affect the power of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). So, to get the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I can consider the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and then multiply it by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because when you multiply two expressions, the coefficients multiply as well. \n\nWait, let me think again. So, \\((a + b)^4\\) has terms like \\(a^4\\), \\(a^3b\\), \\(a^2b^2\\), etc., each multiplied by the terms in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when I multiply, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part. \n\nWait, no. That can't be right because each term in the second expansion is a separate term with different powers of \\(c\\). So, actually, each term in the product will be a combination of a term from \\((a + b)^4\\) and a term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, but the variables are different, so each of these products will be distinct terms. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product will just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nWait, but that doesn't make sense because the entire expansion of the second part is a sum of terms with different powers of \\(c\\), so when you multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), you just get \\(a^2b^2\\) times each of those terms. So, in the final product, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Because each term in the second expansion is a constant (with respect to \\(a\\) and \\(b\\)), so when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, you get \\(a^2b^2\\) times each coefficient. So, the total coefficient would be \\(6 \\times\\) the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. \n\nWait, but the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion is just when we set \\(c = 1\\). So, substituting \\(c = 1\\) into \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). \n\nBut wait, let me check that again. Because in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term from the first expansion is multiplied by each term from the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion is multiplied by every term in the second expansion, each of which has different powers of \\(c\\). So, in the final product, \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each of those terms, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), etc. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not \\(a^2b^2c^6\\) or anything else. So, actually, I think I was wrong earlier. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, because the second part doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. \n\nWait, that can't be right either because when you multiply two expressions, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, if you have \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part, it's multiplied by each term in the second part, which are different powers of \\(c\\). So, in the product, \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each of those \\(c\\) terms, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is actually the same as the coefficient in the first part, because the second part is just adding different powers of \\(c\\). Wait, no, that's not correct because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, you're effectively scaling \\(a^2b^2\\) by each coefficient in the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of the coefficients in the second part. Because each term in the second part adds a multiple of \\(a^2b^2\\). \n\nWait, let me think of a simpler example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^1 \\times (c + d)^1\\). The expansion is \\(ac + ad + bc + bd\\). The coefficient of \\(a\\) is 1 from the first part, and the second part has coefficients 1 and 1, so when multiplied, the coefficient of \\(a\\) in the product would be 1*(1 + 1) = 2? But in reality, the coefficient of \\(a\\) is just 1 because \\(a\\) is only in the first term \\(ac\\). Hmm, so maybe my earlier reasoning was incorrect. \n\nWait, in that example, the coefficient of \\(a\\) in the product is just 1, not 2. Because the \\(a\\) term is only multiplied by \\(c\\), not by both \\(c\\) and \\(d\\). So, in that case, the coefficient of \\(a\\) is 1, not 2. So, perhaps my initial idea that you multiply by the sum of coefficients is wrong. So, maybe the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is just 6, because the second part doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) coefficients. \n\nWait, but that doesn't seem right either because the second part is multiplied by the entire first part. So, perhaps the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. But then, that would mean that \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, resulting in terms like \\(6a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(6a^2b^2c^4\\), etc. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not \\(a^2b^2c^6\\). So, in that case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would just be 6, because the other terms involve different powers of \\(c\\). \n\nWait, but that seems contradictory. Let me try to think again. If I have \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), then when I expand this, each term from \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, for example, the term \\(a^4\\) is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, resulting in \\(a^4c^6\\), \\(a^4c^4\\), etc. Similarly, the term \\(a^3b\\) is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, resulting in \\(a^3bc^6\\), \\(a^3bc^4\\), etc. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, resulting in \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), etc. So, in the entire product, the term \\(a^2b^2c^6\\) has a coefficient of 6, \\(a^2b^2c^4\\) has a coefficient of 6, \\(a^2b^2c^2\\) has a coefficient of 6, \\(a^2b^2\\) has a coefficient of 6, \\(a^2b^2c^{-2}\\) has a coefficient of 6, and so on. \n\nBut the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). Wait, no, actually, the problem just says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\". Hmm, but in the product, \\(a^2b^2\\) is only present in the term where the power of \\(c\\) is zero, right? Because otherwise, it's \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some \\(k\\). So, to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), we need to consider the term where \\(c^k = 1\\), which is when \\(k = 0\\). \n\nWait, no, that's not correct. Because the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would only come from multiplying \\(a^2b^2\\) by the constant term in the second expansion. Let me explain. \n\nSo, when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the product will have terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), \\(a^2b^2c^2\\), \\(a^2b^2\\), \\(a^2b^2c^{-2}\\), \\(a^2b^2c^{-4}\\), and \\(a^2b^2c^{-6}\\). \n\nTherefore, in the entire product, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is only the coefficient from the term where the power of \\(c\\) is zero, i.e., when we multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by the constant term in the second expansion. \n\nWait, no, that's not correct. Because in the product, \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, so each of those products will have a different power of \\(c\\). So, the only term where the power of \\(c\\) is zero is when \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by the constant term in the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part. \n\nWait, that makes sense. Because when you multiply two terms, one from each expansion, the variables are independent. So, to get a term with \\(a^2b^2\\), you need to multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first expansion by the \\(c^0\\) term from the second expansion. All other terms would have some power of \\(c\\), so they wouldn't contribute to the \\(a^2b^2\\) term without any \\(c\\). \n\nSo, to clarify, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nFrom earlier, I found that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. Now, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Looking back at the expansion I did earlier, when \\(m = 3\\), the term is \\(20c^0\\), so the coefficient is 20. \n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). \n\nWait, but earlier I thought it might be 6 times 64, but that was when I considered the sum of all coefficients, which would be if I were looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times something else. But since the problem is just asking for \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), I think I was wrong earlier. Actually, no, the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would only come from the term where \\(c\\) is raised to the zero power because otherwise, it would be \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some \\(k\\), not just \\(a^2b^2\\). \n\nWait, no, the problem doesn't specify anything about \\(c\\). It just says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\". Hmm, so maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me read the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" \n\nSo, the expression is a product of two polynomials. Each term in the product is a combination of a term from the first polynomial and a term from the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) can be formed by taking \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first polynomial and any term from the second polynomial. But wait, that would mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is actually the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial multiplied by the entire second polynomial. But that can't be right because the second polynomial has terms with \\(c\\), so the product would have terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), etc., each with their own coefficients. \n\nBut the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, if the problem is just looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then it's just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial, which is 6, multiplied by the entire second polynomial. But that doesn't make sense because the second polynomial isn't a constant. \n\nWait, perhaps the problem is considering all terms where the variables are \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) only, ignoring \\(c\\). But that seems unlikely. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, treating \\(c\\) as another variable. So, in that case, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would only appear once, when multiplied by \\(c^0\\). \n\nWait, but in the product, \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would actually be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial. Because each term in the second polynomial adds a multiple of \\(a^2b^2\\). \n\nWait, let's test this with a simple example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^1 \\times (c + d)^1 = ac + ad + bc + bd\\). If I want the coefficient of \\(a\\), it's 1 from the first term. But if I consider the coefficient of \\(a\\) in the product, it's only 1 because \\(a\\) is only in the first term. But if I consider the coefficient of \\(a\\) regardless of the other variables, it's still 1. \n\nAlternatively, if I have \\((a + b)^1 \\times (1 + 1)^1 = (a + b) \\times 2 = 2a + 2b\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a\\) is 2, which is the coefficient of \\(a\\) in the first polynomial multiplied by the sum of coefficients in the second polynomial. \n\nWait, so in this case, if the second polynomial is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which expands to terms with coefficients that sum to 64 when \\(c = 1\\), then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nBut earlier, I thought that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is only 6 * 20 = 120 because we're only considering the term where \\(c^0\\). So, which is it? \n\nLet me clarify. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product. So, in the product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) can be combined with any power of \\(c\\), but the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the sum of all coefficients from the second polynomial because each term in the second polynomial scales the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. \n\nWait, no. Because in the product, each term is a combination of a term from the first polynomial and a term from the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), etc. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is actually the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial multiplied by the entire second polynomial. But that's not possible because the second polynomial is not a constant. \n\nWait, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) irrespective of the power of \\(c\\). In that case, the coefficient would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial multiplied by the sum of the coefficients in the second polynomial. Because each term in the second polynomial adds a multiple of \\(a^2b^2\\) to the product. \n\nWait, let me think of another example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^1 \\times (c + 1)^1 = ac + a + bc + b\\). The coefficient of \\(a\\) is 1 (from \\(ac\\)) plus 1 (from \\(a\\)), so total coefficient of \\(a\\) is 2. So, in this case, the coefficient of \\(a\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(a\\) in the first polynomial multiplied by the sum of the coefficients in the second polynomial (which is 2). \n\nSimilarly, in our problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial multiplied by the sum of the coefficients in the second polynomial. \n\nSo, the sum of the coefficients in the second polynomial is when \\(c = 1\\), which is \\(\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). \n\nBut earlier, I thought that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is only 6 * 20 = 120 because we're only considering the term where \\(c^0\\). But now, with the example, it seems that the correct approach is to multiply the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial by the sum of the coefficients in the second polynomial. \n\nWait, but in the example I just did, the coefficient of \\(a\\) in the product was 2, which is the coefficient of \\(a\\) in the first polynomial (1) multiplied by the sum of coefficients in the second polynomial (2). So, that seems to support the idea that in our problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nBut let me think again. In the example, when I set \\(c = 1\\), the second polynomial becomes 2, so the product becomes \\((a + b) * 2 = 2a + 2b\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a\\) is 2, which is indeed 1 * 2. So, that seems to confirm that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nBut wait, in our problem, the second polynomial is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which has terms with both positive and negative exponents of \\(c\\). So, when we multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by this, each term in the product will have a combination of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) exponents and \\(c\\) exponents. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be present in the product multiplied by each term in the second polynomial, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), etc. \n\nBut the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, if we're considering all terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present, regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then the coefficient would indeed be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial multiplied by the sum of the coefficients in the second polynomial. Because each term in the second polynomial scales the \\(a^2b^2\\) term by its coefficient. \n\nWait, but in the example, when I set \\(c = 1\\), I get the sum of coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 64. So, multiplying that by the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial gives 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nAlternatively, if the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms, i.e., the term where the power of \\(c\\) is zero, then the coefficient would be 6 * 20 = 120, because the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second polynomial is 20. \n\nSo, which interpretation is correct? The problem says: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" \n\nI think the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, treating \\(c\\) as another variable. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would only appear when multiplied by the term where \\(c^0\\) in the second polynomial. Therefore, the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nWait, but in the example I did earlier, if I have \\((a + b) \\times (c + 1)\\), the coefficient of \\(a\\) is 2, which is 1 * 2, where 2 is the sum of coefficients in the second polynomial. So, in that case, the coefficient of \\(a\\) is multiplied by the entire sum of coefficients in the second polynomial. So, perhaps in our problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nBut in that example, the term \\(a\\) is being multiplied by each term in the second polynomial, resulting in \\(ac\\) and \\(a\\), so the coefficient of \\(a\\) is 1 (from \\(ac\\)) plus 1 (from \\(a\\)), totaling 2. So, that's the same as 1 * (1 + 1) = 2. \n\nSimilarly, in our problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial multiplied by the sum of coefficients in the second polynomial. So, 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nWait, but in the example, the term \\(a\\) is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial, so the coefficient of \\(a\\) in the product is the sum of the coefficients in the second polynomial. So, in our problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial multiplied by the sum of coefficients in the second polynomial. \n\nTherefore, I think the correct answer is 384. \n\nWait, but let me check this with another example to be sure. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + d)^1\\). The expansion is \\(a^2c + a^2d + 2ab c + 2ab d + b^2c + b^2d\\). The coefficient of \\(a^2b^0\\) is the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) in the first polynomial times the sum of coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 1 * (1 + 1) = 2. But in reality, the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) is just 1, because it's multiplied by \\(c\\) and \\(d\\), so the terms are \\(a^2c\\) and \\(a^2d\\), each with coefficient 1. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) in the product is 1 + 1 = 2, which matches the idea that it's the coefficient in the first polynomial multiplied by the sum of coefficients in the second. \n\nSimilarly, the coefficient of \\(ab\\) in the product would be 2 * (1 + 1) = 4, which is correct because the terms are \\(2abc\\), \\(2abd\\), each with coefficient 2, so total coefficient is 4. \n\nSo, applying this to our problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nWait, but earlier I thought that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would only be 6 * 20 = 120 because we're only considering the term where \\(c^0\\). But now, with these examples, it seems that the correct approach is to multiply by the sum of coefficients in the second polynomial. \n\nWait, but in the example where I have \\((a + b) \\times (c + 1)\\), the coefficient of \\(a\\) is 2, which is 1 * 2. So, in our problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nBut in the problem statement, the variables are \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\). So, when we talk about the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), we're considering all possible terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present, regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would indeed be 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nWait, but in the example, the coefficient of \\(a\\) is 2, which is the same as 1 * 2, where 2 is the sum of coefficients in the second polynomial. So, in our problem, the sum of coefficients in the second polynomial is 64, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nAlternatively, if the problem had asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it would be 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nBut the problem just says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\". So, I think it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). Therefore, the answer should be 384. \n\nWait, but let me make sure. Let me consider the product \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be present in the product multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. So, each of these will have different powers of \\(c\\), but the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the sum of all coefficients from the second polynomial multiplied by the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial. \n\nWait, no, that's not correct. Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second polynomial, each of those products will have a different power of \\(c\\), so they won't contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\). \n\nWait, I'm getting confused. Let me try to think differently. \n\nThe problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. So, in the product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) can only come from multiplying the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first polynomial by the term with \\(c^0\\) in the second polynomial. Because any other term in the second polynomial would introduce a power of \\(c\\), making it \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some \\(k\\), not just \\(a^2b^2\\). \n\nSo, to get the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), we need to multiply the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second polynomial. \n\nFrom the first polynomial, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. From the second polynomial, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nWait, but in the earlier example, when I had \\((a + b) \\times (c + 1)\\), the coefficient of \\(a\\) was 2, which is 1 * 2, where 2 is the sum of coefficients in the second polynomial. But in that case, the second polynomial had a constant term, so when multiplied by \\(a\\), it resulted in a term without \\(c\\). \n\nWait, perhaps the key is whether the second polynomial has a constant term. In our problem, the second polynomial does have a constant term, which is 20. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nBut in the earlier example, the second polynomial was \\((c + 1)\\), which has a constant term of 1. So, the coefficient of \\(a\\) in the product was 1 * 1 (from \\(a \\times 1\\)) plus 1 * 1 (from \\(a \\times c\\)), but wait, no. Actually, in the product \\((a + b) \\times (c + 1)\\), the term \\(a\\) is only from \\(a \\times 1\\), so the coefficient is 1. But I thought earlier it was 2, but that's incorrect. \n\nWait, no, let me expand \\((a + b)(c + 1)\\). It would be \\(a \\times c + a \\times 1 + b \\times c + b \\times 1 = ac + a + bc + b\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a\\) is 1 (from \\(ac\\)) plus 1 (from \\(a\\)), totaling 2. So, in this case, the coefficient of \\(a\\) is indeed 2, which is the coefficient of \\(a\\) in the first polynomial (1) multiplied by the sum of coefficients in the second polynomial (2). \n\nWait, but in our problem, the second polynomial has a sum of coefficients equal to 64, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nBut in the example, the second polynomial was \\((c + 1)\\), which has a constant term of 1 and a term with \\(c^1\\) of 1. So, the sum of coefficients is 2. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a\\) in the product is 1 * 2 = 2. \n\nSimilarly, in our problem, the second polynomial has a sum of coefficients equal to 64, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^"

But wait, the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I need to consider how that multiplication affects the term \\(a^2b^2\\).\n\nLet me think. Since the two parts are multiplied together, each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first part is \\(6a^2b^2\\), and when I multiply it by the entire second part, I need to find the coefficient of the term that doesn't involve \\(c\\) because \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't have any \\(c\\) terms. Wait, no, actually, \\(a^2b^2\\) is just a term with \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the other part is with \\(c\\), so when I multiply \\(6a^2b^2\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the result will be \\(6a^2b^2 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nBut the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression. Wait, but \\(a^2b^2\\) is already part of the first expansion, and when multiplied by the second expansion, which is in terms of \\(c\\), the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, in the product, \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But the question is about the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which suggests that perhaps we're looking for the term where the power of \\(c\\) is zero because \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\). Wait, no, that's not necessarily correct because the entire expression is a product, so \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, each of which has some power of \\(c\\). So, actually, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire second expansion. But that doesn't make sense because the second expansion is in terms of \\(c\\), which is a different variable. \n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again. The problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product. So, in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will appear as \\(6a^2b^2 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is a polynomial in \\(c\\), when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), each term in the expansion will have a factor of \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by a term in \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is simply \\(6 \\times\\) the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that can't be right because the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would then be a polynomial in \\(c\\), but the question is asking for a numerical coefficient, implying that it's a constant. \n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Maybe the question is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). But that doesn't make sense because \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term in the first part, and when multiplied by the second part, it's multiplied by each term in the second expansion, each of which has a different power of \\(c\\). So, actually, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will appear in the product as \\(6a^2b^2 \\times \\text{something}\\), but the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the sum of all the coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by 6. But that's not correct either because each term in the second expansion is a separate term. \n\nWait, maybe the problem is that I'm supposed to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, considering all possible terms. But since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient from the first expansion times the entire second expansion. But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, not a single number. \n\nHmm, perhaps I'm making a mistake here. Let me read the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times any term involving \\(c\\), but that doesn't seem right. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when considering the entire expression, which includes both \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\). But that would mean that \\(a^2b^2\\) is just part of the term, and the rest would involve \\(c\\). So, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). But that would mean that the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the question is asking for a numerical coefficient. \n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think differently. Perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, but since \\(c\\) is in the second part, maybe the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just the coefficient from the first part times the entire second part. But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the question is asking for a numerical coefficient. \n\nWait, maybe the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable, so the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, and thus the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the sum of all the coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by 6. But that would mean the coefficient is a sum of terms involving \\(c\\), which again doesn't make sense. \n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Maybe the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, which includes all variables, but that seems odd. Alternatively, maybe the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some \\(k\\), but the problem doesn't specify. \n\nWait, perhaps I should check the problem again. It says: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, it's only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would be the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the entire second expansion, which is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the coefficient should be a number. \n\nWait, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when considering the entire product, but since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are separate variables, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) multiplied by 6. But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, not a single number. \n\nWait, maybe I'm missing something. Let me think again. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when expanded, it's a product of two polynomials. Each term in the first polynomial is of the form \\(a^{4 - k}b^k\\) multiplied by each term in the second polynomial, which is of the form \\(c^{6 - m}(1/c)^m = c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the entire product will have terms of the form \\(a^{4 - k}b^k c^{6 - 2m}\\). Now, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, we need to find all terms where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2 each. That means, in the first part, \\(a^{4 - k}b^k\\), we need \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). So, that's when \\(k = 2\\), which gives \\(a^2b^2\\) with coefficient 6. Now, when we multiply this by the second part, which is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in that expansion will be multiplied by 6. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product will be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that can't be right because the coefficient should be a number, not a polynomial. \n\nWait, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. But the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), so \\((1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 * 64 = 384. But I'm not sure if that's what the problem is asking for because it's not clear whether the coefficient is considering all powers of \\(c\\) or just the term where \\(c\\) is raised to a specific power. \n\nWait, maybe I should interpret the problem as asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, considering all possible powers of \\(c\\). In that case, the coefficient would indeed be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which would make the coefficient a polynomial in \\(c\\). But since the problem asks for the coefficient, and coefficients are usually numerical, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when considering the entire expression as a product, but that would still involve \\(c\\). \n\nWait, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, but since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are separate, the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\). However, the problem might be asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where \\(c\\) is raised to the zero power. That would make sense because then the coefficient would be a number. \n\nSo, let's assume that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). In that case, I need to find the term in the expansion where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\). \n\nSo, first, from the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. Now, from the second part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\). Because when I multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by \\(c^0\\), I get \\(a^2b^2\\), which is the term we're interested in. \n\nSo, now, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Let's expand \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem:\n\n\\[\n\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n\\]\n\nWe need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0. So, set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\):\n\n\\[\n6 - 2m = 0 \\implies 2m = 6 \\implies m = 3\n\\]\n\nSo, the term where \\(m = 3\\) is the one with \\(c^0\\). The coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). \n\nCalculating that:\n\n\\[\n\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\n\\]\n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion is 20. \n\nNow, going back to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the product of the coefficient from the first part and the coefficient from the second part. So, that's \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). \n\nWait, but let me double-check that. The first part's coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, and the second part's coefficient for \\(c^0\\) is 20. So, when we multiply these, we get 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire expansion is 120. \n\nBut the problem just asks for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), without specifying \\(c\\). So, if we consider that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of the second part, which would be a polynomial. But that doesn't make sense because the coefficient should be a number. Therefore, it's more likely that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, but in that case, the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. Therefore, the most reasonable interpretation is that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. \n\nSo, to summarize:\n\n1. Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is 6.\n2. Expand \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\), which is 20.\n3. Multiply these two coefficients together to get 6 * 20 = 120.\n4. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire product is 120.\n\nI think that makes sense. Let me just check if I made any mistakes in the calculations. \n\nFirst, the binomial coefficient for \\((a + b)^4\\) at \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). \n\nNext, for \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0 occurs when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), so \\(m = 3\\). The binomial coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). \n\nMultiplying 6 and 20 gives 120, so the coefficient is 120. \n\nYes, that seems correct.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is found by considering the expansion of each part separately and then combining the relevant coefficients. \n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\):**\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n\n2. **Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   The coefficient of \\(c^0\\) (the constant term) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n\n3. **Multiply the coefficients:**\n   \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

    "text": " \n\nSo, for \\((a + b)^4\\), using the binomial theorem, each term will be \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\\) where \\(k\\) goes from 0 to 4. So, the expansion will be \\(\\dbinom{4}{0}a^4b^0 + \\dbinom{4}{1}a^3b^1 + \\dbinom{4}{2}a^2b^2 + \\dbinom{4}{3}a^1b^3 + \\dbinom{4}{4}a^0b^4\\). Simplifying the coefficients, that's \\(1 \\cdot a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + 1b^4\\). \n\nWait, so the term with \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(6a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient here is 6. But wait, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I think that means I need to consider the entire product, not just the \\((a + b)^4\\) part. \n\nSo, maybe I need to multiply the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) by the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) and then look for the term where the variables are \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, but the second part involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), so when I multiply, the variables in each term will be a combination of \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\), and \\(1/c\\). But the problem is only asking about the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). That suggests that I need to consider terms where the product of the two expansions results in \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by some power of \\(c\\). But actually, no, the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). Or does it mean that the entire term should be \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms? Hmm, that might not make sense because the other part has \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). \n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) as separate variables, but since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are different variables from \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be the same as the coefficient in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't sound right either because when you multiply two polynomials, each term from the first polynomial is multiplied by each term from the second polynomial. \n\nWait, no, actually, when you have a product of two expressions, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each factor. But in this case, the terms in \\((a + b)^4\\) are only involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), while the terms in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) involve \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, when you multiply them, each term will be a product of an \\(a^kb^{4 - k}\\) term and a \\(c^m c^{-n}\\) term, where \\(m + n = 6\\). But the problem is only asking about the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, that would mean that every term in the product that has \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by any power of \\(c\\) will contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). \n\nWait, but that can't be right because then the coefficient would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But I don't think that's what the problem is asking. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, maybe it's asking for the coefficient of the term \\(a^2b^2\\) times any combination of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). But in that case, the coefficient would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nWait, but that doesn't seem right because when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a term like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) would be the product of the coefficients of \\(a^2b^2\\) and \\(c^k\\). So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), I think I need to sum over all possible terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any power of \\(c\\). \n\nWait, no, actually, when you have a product of two expressions, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each factor. So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I need to consider all possible terms in the product where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since \\(a^2b^2\\) is from \\((a + b)^4\\), its coefficient is 6, as I found earlier. Then, when I multiply by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in that expansion is a coefficient times \\(c^k\\) or \\(c^{-k}\\), where \\(k\\) ranges from 0 to 6. \n\nWait, so if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, it would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because when you multiply \\(6a^2b^2\\) by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be \\(6\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nBut wait, the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\). So, if I substitute \\(c = 1\\), the expression becomes \\((1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of all coefficients is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). \n\nWait, but that seems a bit high. Let me check that again. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Perhaps the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then considering that the other part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms, so the coefficient remains 6. But that doesn't make sense because when you multiply two expressions, the coefficients do combine. \n\nWait, no, actually, when you multiply two polynomials, each term from the first polynomial is multiplied by each term from the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be \\(6\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). As I calculated earlier, that sum is 64, so the total coefficient would be \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). \n\nWait, but I'm not sure if that's correct. Let me think differently. Maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, so the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be accompanied by some power of \\(c\\). But the problem didn't specify any particular power of \\(c\\), so maybe it's just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) term. \n\nBut in that case, the coefficient would indeed be \\(6\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 64, so 6 \u00d7 64 = 384. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\), which is 1. In that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nWait, that makes more sense. So, perhaps I misinterpreted the problem. Maybe it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out. So, in that case, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) and then multiply it by the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\). \n\nSo, let's try that approach. First, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, as before. Now, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is the middle term when expanded, which occurs when the exponents of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) balance out. \n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\), we can use the binomial theorem again. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We want the exponent of \\(c\\) to be 0, so we set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\). \n\nSo, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Now, since we're looking for the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\), the overall coefficient would be \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). \n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused now. Earlier, I thought the problem was asking for the coefficient regardless of \\(c\\), but now I'm considering only the \\(c^0\\) term. Let me check the problem statement again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" It doesn't specify any particular power of \\(c\\), so perhaps it's indeed asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times any power of \\(c\\). In that case, the coefficient would be \\(6\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 64, giving \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). \n\nBut now I'm second-guessing myself because the problem might be interpreted differently. Alternatively, maybe the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which would mean that we're considering all possible terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any power of \\(c\\). In that case, the coefficient would be the product of the coefficients, so \\(6\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 64, giving 384. \n\nAlternatively, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it's 120. Hmm, I need to figure out which interpretation is correct. Let me think about how the problem is phrased. It says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)\". Since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are variables separate from \\(c\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be accompanied by some power of \\(c\\). But the problem doesn't specify any particular power of \\(c\\), so perhaps it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). \n\nIn that case, the coefficient would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 64, giving 384. \n\nBut wait, let me consider an example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^1 \\times (c + 1/c)^1 = (a + b)(c + 1/c)\\). The expansion would be \\(ac + a/c + bc + b/c\\). The coefficient of \\(a\\) would be \\(c + 1/c\\), but if we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a\\) regardless of \\(c\\), it's not a single number. So, maybe that's not the right approach. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), which would make the term \\(a^2b^2\\), and the coefficient would be 120. That seems more plausible because otherwise, the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense. \n\nWait, but the problem didn't specify \\(c^0\\), so maybe it's just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, which would include all possible powers of \\(c\\). But in that case, the coefficient would be a sum over all possible \\(c\\) terms, which would be 6 times the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 64, giving 384. \n\nI'm a bit torn here. Let me try to think of it another way. If I consider the entire product, \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the terms will be of the form \\(a^kb^{4 - k} \\times c^m\\), where \\(k\\) ranges from 0 to 4 and \\(m\\) ranges from -6 to 6 in steps of 2. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by each possible \\(c^m\\), each with their own coefficients. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). \n\nSince the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). \n\nBut I'm still a bit unsure because sometimes when you have multiple variables, the coefficient is considered in the context of all variables. So, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be 120. \n\nWait, let me check that. If I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then I need to find the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\). So, that would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 20. So, 6 \u00d7 20 = 120. \n\nAlternatively, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), it's 6 \u00d7 64 = 384. \n\nI think the confusion arises from whether the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) irrespective of the \\(c\\) terms or specifically the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\). \n\nGiven that the problem is written as \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", without specifying \\(c\\), it might be more appropriate to consider that the coefficient is 6, because in the product, each term from \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the same as in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients from the other part. \n\nWait, no, that doesn't seem right because when you multiply two polynomials, each term is a product of terms from each polynomial. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Because each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 multiplied by the sum of coefficients of all terms in the second polynomial. \n\nSo, the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is found by substituting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\(2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). \n\nBut now I'm conflicting with my earlier thought where I considered only the \\(c^0\\) term. I think the key is whether the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) irrespective of the \\(c\\) terms or specifically the term where \\(c^0\\) is present. \n\nGiven the problem statement, \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)\", it seems that it's asking for the coefficient of the term \\(a^2b^2\\) times any power of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 64, giving 384. \n\nAlternatively, if the problem had specified that it wanted the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it would be 120. But since it didn't specify, I think it's safer to assume that it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), which would be 384. \n\nWait, but let me think again. When you have a product of two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each polynomial. So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I need to consider all terms in the product where the variables are \\(a^2b^2\\) times any combination of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). Therefore, the coefficient would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). \n\nSo, yes, that would be 6 \u00d7 64 = 384. \n\nBut I'm still a bit uncertain because sometimes in problems like this, they might be asking for the coefficient of a specific term, like \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), but since it's not specified, I think the answer is 384. \n\nWait, but let me check with a simpler example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^1 \\times (c + 1/c)^1 = (a + b)(c + 1/c)\\). The expansion is \\(ac + a/c + bc + b/c\\). Now, what is the coefficient of \\(a\\) in this product? Well, it's \\(c + 1/c\\). But if we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a\\) regardless of \\(c\\), it's not a single number. So, maybe in that case, the problem would specify a particular power of \\(c\\). \n\nGiven that, perhaps the original problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be 120. That makes more sense because otherwise, the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\), which isn't a single number. \n\nWait, but the problem didn't specify \\(c^0\\), so maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) as separate variables, and it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. In that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 64, giving 384. \n\nBut I think, given that \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are separate variables, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6, because the other polynomial doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. Wait, that can't be right because when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficients do combine. \n\nWait, no, that's not correct. When you multiply two polynomials, each term from the first is multiplied by each term from the second. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial. Because \\(a^2b^2\\) is being multiplied by every possible term from the second polynomial, each contributing a coefficient. So, the total coefficient would be 6 \u00d7 64 = 384. \n\nAlternatively, if the problem had specified a particular power of \\(c\\), like \\(c^2\\), then the coefficient would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^2\\) in the second polynomial. But since it's not specified, I think the answer is 384. \n\nBut now I'm really confused because I'm getting conflicting interpretations. Let me try to think of it differently. Maybe the problem is written in a way that the variables \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are all present, and it's asking for the coefficient of the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any power of \\(c\\). In that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 64, giving 384. \n\nAlternatively, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), it's 120. But since it's not specified, I think the answer is 384. \n\nWait, but let me think again. If I have \\((a + b)^4\\) times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is in the first part, and when I multiply by the second part, each term in the second part is a coefficient times a power of \\(c\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each of these, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all coefficients from the second part. \n\nTherefore, the coefficient is 6 \u00d7 64 = 384. \n\nI think that's the correct approach. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 384. \n\nBut just to make sure, let me calculate the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). As I did earlier, setting \\(c = 1\\) gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of all coefficients is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 \u00d7 64 = 384. \n\nYes, that makes sense. So, the final answer is 384. \n\nWait, but I'm still a bit unsure because sometimes when you have multiple variables, you might only consider the term where all variables are present to a certain power. But in this case, the problem didn't specify any particular power for \\(c\\), so I think it's safe to go with 384. \n\nAlternatively, if I consider that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, then the coefficient is 6 \u00d7 64 = 384. \n\nSo, after all that thinking, I believe the coefficient is 384. \n\nWait, but I just remembered that when you have \\((a + b)^4\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6a^2b^2, and when you multiply by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in that expansion is a coefficient times \\(c^k\\) or \\(c^{-k}\\). So, when you multiply \\(6a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, the coefficient for each \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) term is 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^k\\) in the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the sum over all \\(k\\) of 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^k\\), which is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, giving 384. \n\nYes, that seems correct. So, the coefficient is 384. \n\nWait, but earlier I thought it might be 120, but that was under the assumption that we're only considering the \\(c^0\\) term. Since the problem didn't specify, I think 384 is the correct answer. \n\nSo, in conclusion, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplying it by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The sum of coefficients in the second expression is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), resulting in \\(2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n\\boxed{384}"

    "text": " \n\nFor \\((a + b)^4\\), the expansion will be \\(\\dbinom{4}{0}a^4b^0 + \\dbinom{4}{1}a^3b^1 + \\dbinom{4}{2}a^2b^2 + \\dbinom{4}{3}a^1b^3 + \\dbinom{4}{4}a^0b^4\\). Calculating the coefficients, that becomes \\(1 \\cdot a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + 1b^4\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in this part is 6. \n\nWait, but the original expression isn't just \\((a + b)^4\\); it's multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I need to consider the entire product. That means the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the whole expression will depend on the product of the coefficients from each part, right? Because when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficients multiply.\n\nSo, let me think. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\), and its coefficient is 6. Now, I need to multiply this by something from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, does the term \\(a^2b^2\\) involve any c terms? It doesn't; it's purely in terms of a and b. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression will just be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by something that has a c term, it would result in a term like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), but we're only interested in the term where the c terms cancel out, i.e., \\(c^0\\), so that the overall term is just \\(a^2b^2\\).\n\nOkay, so now I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Again, I can use the binomial theorem for this. Let me write it out: \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k\\). Simplifying each term, that becomes \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k - k} = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\).\n\nSo, I need the term where the exponent of c is 0, which means \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for k: \\(6 = 2k\\) so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). \n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the second part). So, 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, let me double-check that. So, in the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. In the second part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Since these are independent parts, when you multiply the two expressions, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But since we're only interested in the constant term (with respect to c), which is 20, the coefficient becomes 6 * 20 = 120. That makes sense.\n\nAlternatively, I could think of the entire expression as a product of two polynomials, and the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would only come from the product of the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first polynomial and the constant term in the second polynomial. So, yes, that's consistent. \n\nJust to make sure I didn't make any calculation errors, let me verify the binomial coefficients again. For \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficients are indeed 1, 4, 6, 4, 1, so \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. For \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\\), so when 6 - 2k = 0, k=3, and \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\) is 20. So, 6*20=120. Yep, that seems correct.\n\nI think I'm confident that the coefficient is 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem.\n\nFirst, we expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n\\]\nThe term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\), and its coefficient is:\n\\[\n\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\n\\]\n\nNext, we need to consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem:\n\\[\n\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n\\]\nWe need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, which occurs when \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(k = 3\\). The coefficient for this term is:\n\\[\n\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\n\\]\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficients from each part:\n\\[\n6 \\times 20 = 120\n\\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

Calculating the coefficients, that's \\(1a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + 1b^4\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in this part is 6. \n\nWait, but the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I need to consider how this multiplication affects the coefficient. Hmm, let me think. Since the two parts of the expression are multiplied together, the terms from each expansion will combine. But I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so maybe I don't need to consider all the terms involving c. \n\nWait, actually, no. Because when you multiply two expressions, each term from the first expression gets multiplied by each term from the second expression. So, if I have a term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part, and I multiply it by a term from the second part, which is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the resulting term would be \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by some term involving c. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, does that mean regardless of the c terms? Or is it considering the entire expression, so maybe I'm supposed to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some k? \n\nWait, the problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", so I think it's just the coefficient for the term \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of what's happening with c. So, in that case, I can treat the two parts separately. That is, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and then when I multiply by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, that doesn't make sense because then the coefficient would be a polynomial in c, not a constant. \n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expanded expression, but considering all possible terms, including those involving c. So, when we multiply the two expansions, each term from \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by every term in the second part, each contributing to different terms in the final expansion. But if the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the c terms, then it would just be 6 times the entire expansion of the second part, which would be a sum of terms involving c. But that would mean the coefficient is not a single number but a polynomial. \n\nWait, that doesn't seem right. Maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me re-read the problem: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, perhaps the problem is treating the entire expression as a polynomial in variables a, b, c, and 1/c, and it's asking for the coefficient of the term where a is squared and b is squared, regardless of the powers of c. So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all terms in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that can't be right because the coefficient should be a constant, not a polynomial. \n\nWait, maybe I'm supposed to consider that the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any term from the second expansion, so the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, because each term in the second expansion is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). But that would make the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) equal to 6 times the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nWait, but the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) would be found by setting c = 1, right? Because substituting c = 1 would make each term equal to its coefficient. So, let me calculate that. \n\n\\(\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = (2)^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nWait, but that seems too straightforward. Let me check if that's correct. Alternatively, maybe I'm supposed to consider that the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is only multiplied by the constant term in the second expansion, which would be the term where c^0. Because otherwise, the term would have some power of c, but the problem is only asking for \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of c. So, if the problem is just looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the c terms, then it would be 6 times the constant term in the second expansion. \n\nWait, let me think again. The problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\". So, in the entire expansion, each term is of the form \\(a^kb^{4 - k}c^m\\) or something like that. But the problem is only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of c. So, in that case, every term in the second expansion will contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by any term from the second expansion, the result will have \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by some power of c. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so perhaps it's considering the entire coefficient, including the c terms. But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in c, which seems unlikely because the problem probably expects a numerical coefficient. \n\nWait, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), that is, the term where a is squared, b is squared, and c is to the zero power. That would make sense because then the coefficient would be a single number. So, let me try that approach. \n\nSo, if I need the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then I need to find the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nI already found that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. Now, let's find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\), which is the same as the constant term, we can use the binomial theorem again. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). \n\nWe need the exponent of c to be 0, so set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for k, we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\), which is 20. \n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire expression is 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nWait, but earlier I thought the answer might be 384, but that was when I considered the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which would be 64, leading to 6 * 64 = 384. But now, considering that the problem is asking for \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of c, but if it's specifically \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it's 120. \n\nWait, perhaps I should clarify. The problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\". In the context of polynomials, when you have multiple variables, the coefficient of a specific term is the numerical factor in front of that term, regardless of other variables. So, in this case, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) can be part of terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for various k. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the sum of all coefficients from terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present, regardless of the c terms. \n\nWait, but that would mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which would result in a polynomial in c. But the problem is asking for a coefficient, which is a number, not a polynomial. Therefore, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating, and the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), treating c as another variable, but in that case, the coefficient would be a polynomial in c. However, since the problem didn't specify any particular power of c, perhaps it's intended to consider only the term where c is raised to the zero power, making the entire term \\(a^2b^2\\), which would have a coefficient of 120. \n\nLet me verify this. So, the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) gives \\(a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). The expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) gives terms from \\(c^6\\) down to \\(c^{-6}\\) with various coefficients. When you multiply these two expansions together, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), ..., down to \\(a^2b^2c^{-6}\\). \n\nBut if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of c, then the coefficient would be the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by 6. Because each term in the second expansion, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), contributes to a term with \\(a^2b^2\\) and some power of c. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) across all possible c terms would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion. \n\nWait, but the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion is found by setting c = 1, which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nBut this contradicts my earlier conclusion of 120. So, which is correct? \n\nLet me think again. If the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the c terms, then it's 384. But if it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it's 120. \n\nLooking back at the problem statement: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" The way it's phrased, it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which in the context of the entire expression would be the sum of all coefficients where the term is \\(a^2b^2\\) times some power of c. So, the coefficient would indeed be 6 multiplied by the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, giving 384. \n\nWait, but that seems a bit odd because the coefficient would then be a constant, not a polynomial. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering only the term where c is to the zero power, so the coefficient is 120. \n\nI'm a bit confused now. Let me try to see which interpretation makes more sense. If I consider that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of c, then it's 384. But if it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), it's 120. \n\nWait, maybe I can look at an example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^1 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, expanding, it would be \\((a + b)(c + 1/c)\\). The term \\(a^1b^0\\) is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, so the coefficient of \\(a^1b^0\\) would be \\(1 \\times (1 + 1) = 2\\), because the sum of coefficients in the second expansion is 2. Similarly, the coefficient of \\(a^0b^1\\) would be 1 * 2 = 2. But if I were to ask for the coefficient of \\(a^1b^0c^0\\), it would be 1 * 1 = 1, since the constant term in the second expansion is 1. \n\nSo, in this small example, the coefficient of \\(a^1b^0\\) is 2, which is the sum of coefficients in the second expansion. Therefore, applying that to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nWait, but in the small example, the coefficient of \\(a^1b^0c^0\\) is 1, which is different from the coefficient of \\(a^1b^0\\), which is 2. So, depending on whether the problem is asking for the coefficient regardless of c or specifically for \\(c^0\\), the answer changes. \n\nGiven that the problem is stated as \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", without specifying anything about c, I think it's more likely that it's asking for the coefficient regardless of c, which would be 384. \n\nBut I'm still a bit uncertain. Let me try to compute both ways and see which makes sense. \n\nFirst, if I compute the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), it's 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nIf I compute the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of c, it's 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nBut in the small example, the coefficient of \\(a^1b^0\\) is 2, which is the sum of coefficients in the second expansion. So, perhaps in the original problem, the answer is 384. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is intended to have the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. \n\nWait, perhaps I can check by expanding both parts and looking for the term \\(a^2b^2\\). \n\nIn \\((a + b)^4\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6a^2b^2. When multiplied by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which expands to terms like \\(c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15c^{-2} + 6c^{-4} + c^{-6}\\). So, when I multiply 6a^2b^2 by each term, I get 6a^2b^2c^6 + 36a^2b^2c^4 + 90a^2b^2c^2 + 120a^2b^2 + 90a^2b^2c^{-2} + 36a^2b^2c^{-4} + 6a^2b^2c^{-6}\\). \n\nSo, in this expanded form, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is 120. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of c would be the sum of all coefficients, which is 6*(1 + 6 + 15 + 20 + 15 + 6 + 1) = 6*64 = 384. \n\nBut in the problem statement, it's only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so it's ambiguous whether it's considering all terms or just the term with c^0. \n\nWait, perhaps I should look back at the problem's wording. It says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\". In algebra, when you have multiple variables, the coefficient of a term is the factor in front of that term, regardless of the other variables. So, for example, in the term \\(6a^2b^2c^6\\), the coefficient is 6, and the variables are \\(a^2b^2c^6\\). But in the term \\(120a^2b^2\\), the coefficient is 120, and the variables are \\(a^2b^2\\). \n\nSo, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), it's specifically looking for the term where the variables are exactly \\(a^2b^2\\), which would be \\(120a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient is 120. \n\nWait, that makes sense because in the expanded expression, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) appears only once, with coefficient 120, as part of \\(120a^2b^2\\). The other terms have additional factors of c, so they are not exactly \\(a^2b^2\\); they are \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for various k. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120. \n\nSo, I think I was confused earlier because I considered the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of c, but actually, the problem is asking for the coefficient of the term where a is squared, b is squared, and c is not present, i.e., c^0. Therefore, the correct coefficient is 120. \n\nLet me confirm this by another approach. The general term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}a^{4 - k}b^k\\), and the general term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\). \n\nWhen you multiply these two expansions, the term \\(a^{4 - k}b^k c^{6 - 2m}\\) will be present. We are interested in the term where \\(a^2b^2\\), so \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). So, from the first part, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). \n\nFrom the second part, we need the term where \\(c^{6 - 2m} = c^0\\), so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which gives \\(m = 3\\). The coefficient from the second part is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). \n\nTherefore, the combined coefficient is \\(6 * 20 = 120\\). \n\nYes, that makes sense. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120. \n\nI think I was overcomplicating it earlier by considering the sum of all coefficients, but now I'm confident that the correct answer is 120. \n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem for both parts of the expression.\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term containing \\(a^2b^2\\) is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\n   \\]\n   So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\n2. **Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n   \\]\n   We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, which occurs when:\n   \\[\n   6 - 2m = 0 \\implies m = 3\n   \\]\n   The coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\n   \\]\n\n3. **Combine the results:**\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20.

I need the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which means I need the term where \\(a\\) is squared and \\(b\\) is squared. That would correspond to when \\(4 - k = 2\\) for \\(a\\) and \\(k = 2\\) for \\(b\\). So, \\(k = 2\\). Let me calculate that coefficient.\n\nThe binomial coefficient \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) is \\(\\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6. \n\nNow, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the second part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I wonder if I need to consider the expansion of this as well. But wait, the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is in the first part. Since the second part is multiplied by the first, and \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) don't appear in the second part, maybe the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. But wait, no, because when you multiply two expressions, each term from the first is multiplied by each term from the second. However, since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are only in the first part, and the second part is in terms of \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 times the entire expansion of the second part, but since we're only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), I think it's just 6 times the sum of the coefficients of the second part? Wait, no, that's not right.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think again. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when you multiply these two, each term in the expansion of the first will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of the second. But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term that only comes from the first part, and when you multiply it by any term from the second part, it will still have \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by some power of \\(c\\). But the question is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part, but since we're only interested in \\(a^2b^2\\), which is independent of \\(c\\), maybe the coefficient is just 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second part? Wait, no, that doesn't make sense.\n\nWait, no, actually, when you multiply two expressions, the coefficients of specific terms add up if they can combine. But in this case, since \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by terms involving \\(c\\), which are separate variables, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in the second part because each term in the second part is a coefficient times a power of \\(c\\), and when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), it becomes \\(a^2b^2\\) times that coefficient times \\(c^k\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, actually, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in the second expansion because each term in the second expansion contributes its coefficient to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). \n\nWait, but that seems a bit off. Let me think differently. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when you expand this, each term will be a term from the first expansion multiplied by a term from the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the first expansion, and it is multiplied by every term in the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part (which is 6) multiplied by the entire second expansion. But since we're looking for the coefficient, and not the entire term, it's 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in the second expansion. Because each term in the second expansion is a coefficient times a power of \\(c\\), and when you multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), the coefficient becomes 6 times that coefficient. So, the total coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nWait, but the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\). So, let me calculate that. If \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 times 64, which is 384. \n\nWait, but hold on a second. Let me verify that. Because when you set \\(c = 1\\), you get the sum of the coefficients, which is correct. So, the second part's expansion, when \\(c = 1\\), is 64, so the sum of coefficients is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 * 64 = 384. That seems correct.\n\nBut let me think again to make sure I'm not making a mistake. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, in the entire expression, each term is of the form \\(a^kb^{4 - k} \\times c^m \\times \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^n\\), where \\(k\\) ranges from 0 to 4, and \\(m + n = 6\\) for the second part. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is when \\(k = 2\\), so \\(a^2b^2\\), and the exponent of \\(c\\) can be anything because the problem doesn't specify a particular power of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the sum of all coefficients from the second part, which is 64. So, 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but is that the case? Let me consider that when you have two polynomials multiplied together, the coefficient of a specific term in one polynomial is multiplied by all the terms in the other polynomial. So, in this case, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial is multiplied by every term in the second polynomial, which has terms like \\(c^6\\), \\(c^4\\), \\(c^2\\), \\(c^0\\), \\(c^{-2}\\), \\(c^{-4}\\), \\(c^{-6}\\), each with their own coefficients. So, each of these terms, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), contributes to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), etc. But the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in effect, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the coefficient from the first part, 6, multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients from the second part, which is 64, giving 384.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem had asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then we would have to find the term where \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion, which is the middle term. But since it's just \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\), it's the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion times 6.\n\nWait, but let me make sure. Let me think of it as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and since the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which has 64 as the sum of coefficients, then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 * 64 = 384. That makes sense because when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in one is multiplied by all coefficients in the other, and since we're summing over all possible combinations, it's 6 * 64.\n\nAlternatively, if I were to consider the entire expansion, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, each contributing their own coefficient, so the total coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) across all powers of \\(c\\) is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nSo, I think that's the correct approach. Therefore, the coefficient is 384.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem**:\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term with \\(a^2b^2\\) is when \\(k = 2\\):\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\n   \\]\n   So, the coefficient is 6.\n\n2. **Consider the second part \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)**:\n   The sum of all coefficients in this expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\):\n   \\[\n   \\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\n   \\]\n\n3. **Multiply the coefficients**:\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the two coefficients:\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 64 = 384\n   \\]\n\n**Answer**: The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{384}\\)."

Calculating the binomial coefficients, that's \\(1 \\cdot a^4 + 4 \\cdot a^3b + 6 \\cdot a^2b^2 + 4 \\cdot ab^3 + 1 \\cdot b^4\\).

So, I need to consider how this multiplication affects the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Hmm, since the two parts of the product are independent of each other (one involves a and b, the other involves c and 1/c), the coefficients from each part will multiply when we take the product. \n\nIn other words, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part will multiply every term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\).

So, when we expand this, each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part will be multiplied by every term in the second expansion. \n\nBut the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Since the second part doesn't involve a or b, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. Wait, but that would mean the coefficient is 6 times something. But that doesn't sound right because the second part is separate. \n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. Maybe the question is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of what's happening with c. In other words, when you multiply the two expressions, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be present, and its coefficient will be the product of the coefficients from each part. But since the second part doesn't involve a or b, the coefficient from the second part is actually 1 when considering terms that don't affect a or b. \n\nWait, no, that can't be right. Let me think again. Let me break it down. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When you expand this, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, for example, the term \\(a^4\\) from the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part, resulting in terms like \\(a^4c^6\\), \\(a^4c^5\\), etc. Similarly, the term \\(a^3b\\) is multiplied by each term in the second part, giving terms like \\(a^3bc^6\\), \\(a^3bc^5\\), etc. \n\nBut the problem is specifically asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, we're looking for all terms in the product where the power of a is 2 and the power of b is 2. Now, in the first part, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) has a coefficient of 6. Then, when we multiply this by the entire second expansion, we get \\(6 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nBut wait, that would mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't make sense because the coefficient should be a numerical value, not an expression involving c. \n\nWait, perhaps I'm misinterpreting the question. Maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where the exponents of a, b, and c are 2, 2, and 0, respectively. But the problem doesn't specify anything about c, so maybe it's just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the c terms. \n\nIf that's the case, then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is indeed 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems odd because the coefficient would then be a polynomial in c, not a single number. \n\nWait, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating c as a separate variable. So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems too broad. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, considering all possible terms, which would involve summing over the coefficients from the second expansion. \n\nWait, perhaps I should think of it differently. Let me consider the entire expression as a product of two independent expansions. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Because when you multiply by the entire second expansion, each term in the first part is scaled by the entire second expansion. \n\nBut the sum of all coefficients in the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), is found by setting c = 1. So, substituting c = 1, we get \\((1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of all coefficients in the second part is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nWait, but I'm not sure if that's correct. Let me check. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6. The second part, when multiplied by 6, would contribute 6 times each term in its expansion. But the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would include all the terms from the second expansion multiplied by 6. But since the second expansion doesn't involve a or b, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. \n\nBut that would mean the coefficient is 6*(c^6 + 6c^5 + 15c^4 + 20c^3 + 15c^2 + 6c + 1). But the problem is asking for the coefficient, which is a number, not an expression. So, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question. Maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where a is squared, b is squared, and c is to the zero power. \n\nIf that's the case, then I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product. So, in the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. In the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), I need the coefficient of \\(c^0\\), which is the constant term. \n\nTo find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), I can use the binomial theorem again. The general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - k}\\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\\). We want the exponent of c to be 0, so 6 - 2k = 0 => k = 3. So, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). \n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire product is 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nWait, that makes more sense. So, the problem was probably asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by \\(c^0\\), which is the constant term. So, the answer is 120. \n\nBut let me double-check. The first part gives 6 for \\(a^2b^2\\), and the second part gives 20 for \\(c^0\\). Multiplying them gives 120. So, yes, that seems correct.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. To find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire expression, we also need the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20. Multiplying these gives 6 * 20 = 120.\n\n\\boxed{120}"

So, when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in the expansion will be a product of a term from the first expansion and a term from the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will come from the first expansion, and it will be multiplied by every term in the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part.

Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 * 64 = 384. But wait, that seems high. Let me check again.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, but considering that the second part is also being expanded, but since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient would just be 6 times the sum of the coefficients of the second expansion, which is 6*64=384. But I'm not sure if that's correct. Alternatively, maybe the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, so it's 6 times the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion, which is indeed 6*64=384.\n\nWait, but let me think again. When you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum of the products of the coefficients of terms whose exponents add up to that term. But in this case, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial is being multiplied by every term in the second polynomial, regardless of the \\(c\\) exponent. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would indeed be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part. So, 6 * 64 = 384. So, the coefficient is 384.\n\nWait, but let me make sure. Alternatively, maybe the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, without considering the \\(c\\) terms, which would mean that the coefficient is just 6, because the second part is being multiplied as a whole. But that doesn't make sense because the second part is a polynomial, so when you multiply, each term in the second part affects the coefficient. Hmm, I'm a bit confused now.\n\nWait, perhaps I should approach it differently. Let me consider that the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the expansion will have terms of the form \\(a^kb^{4 - k} \\times c^m \\times (1/c)^{6 - m}\\), which simplifies to \\(a^kb^{4 - k}c^{m - (6 - m)} = a^kb^{4 - k}c^{2m - 6}\\). But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which corresponds to \\(k=2\\) in the first part, so \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} \\times\\) the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, each term contributes its coefficient. So, as I thought earlier, the sum of coefficients in the second expansion is when \\(c=1\\), which is 2^6=64. So, the coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me confirm this with an example. Suppose I have a simpler case, say \\((a + b)^1 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, expanding, it's (a + b)(c + 1/c) = a c + a/c + b c + b/c. The coefficient of \\(a^1b^0\\) would be (1 choose 1) * (1 choose 1) = 1*1=1 for each term, but actually, the coefficient of \\(a c\\) is 1, but when considering the coefficient of \\(a\\) regardless of \\(c\\), it's 1*(1 + 1) = 2? Wait, no, in this case, the coefficient of \\(a\\) would be 1*(c + 1/c), which is not a number but an expression. Hmm, maybe my initial approach is wrong.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in the product, each term is \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by some term from the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the sum of all coefficients in the second part, because each term in the second part contributes its coefficient when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). So, that would be 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm misapplying the concept. Let me think again. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the sum over all possible ways to get \\(a^2b^2\\) when multiplying a term from \\((a + b)^4\\) and a term from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But since \\(a^2b^2\\) is only from the first part, and the second part doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), the coefficient is just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire second part. Wait, but that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the entire second expansion, which is a polynomial, not a number. So, that can't be right.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is intended to have the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2 each, and the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0. That would make more sense, because then we're looking for a specific term. But the problem as stated is only asking for \\(a^2b^2\\), without mentioning \\(c\\). Hmm, maybe I should assume that the problem wants the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), which would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6*64=384.\n\nBut to be thorough, let me check another approach. Let's expand both parts separately and then see how the coefficients combine. \n\nFirst, \\((a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6.\n\nNext, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem, this expands to \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(1/c\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\).\n\nNow, when we multiply these two expansions together, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, resulting in terms like \\(6a^2b^2 \\times \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\).\n\nBut the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in the product, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by 6, because each term in the second expansion contributes its coefficient when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the total coefficient is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion.\n\nAs before, the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), so \\(\\left(1 + 1/1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. Suppose I have two polynomials, P(a, b) and Q(c). Then, the product P(a, b) * Q(c) would have terms where each term in P is multiplied by each term in Q. So, the coefficient of a specific term in P, say \\(a^2b^2\\), would be multiplied by every term in Q, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in P times the sum of all coefficients in Q. Because each term in Q contributes its coefficient when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\).\n\nSo, in this case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6, and the sum of coefficients in the second part is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. Therefore, the coefficient is 384.\n\nI think that makes sense. So, I'm confident now that the coefficient is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is found by first determining the coefficient in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplying it by the sum of the coefficients in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 64. Thus, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n\\boxed{384}"

So, expanding it, I get:\n\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\n\\]\n\nOkay, so that's the expansion of the first part. Now, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which in this expansion is 6. But wait, the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I can't just take 6 as the coefficient because I have to consider the entire product.\n\nHmm, so the entire expression is the product of two binomials raised to powers: \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Since these two parts are multiplied together, the terms from each expansion will multiply each other. But I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). \n\nWait, but \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), so maybe I can consider the terms separately. Let me think. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\), which we already found to have a coefficient of 6. Now, when we multiply this by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we need to see how this affects the term \\(a^2b^2\\). \n\nBut actually, since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term in the first part, and the second part is a separate expansion, when we multiply them, each term in the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. However, since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), it will just be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not considering any \\(c\\) terms. Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating this.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to clarify: the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), so when we expand both parts, we'll have a lot of terms, each being a product of a term from the first expansion and a term from the second expansion. But the question is specifically asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). That term doesn't involve \\(c\\), so when we multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by any term from the second expansion, it will still be \\(a^2b^2\\) times something with \\(c\\). But the problem is only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which suggests that perhaps the other part must be a constant term, i.e., \\(c^0\\), so that when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), it remains \\(a^2b^2\\). \n\nWait, that makes sense. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 (from the first part) multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because only the constant term in the second expansion will multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) to keep it as \\(a^2b^2\\), without any \\(c\\) terms. So, I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nAlright, let's work on expanding \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Again, using the binomial theorem, which states that \\((x + y)^n = \\sum_{k=0}^{n} \\dbinom{n}{k} x^{n - k} y^k\\). So, in this case, \\(x = c\\), \\(y = \\dfrac{1}{c}\\), and \\(n = 6\\). So, the expansion is:\n\n\\[\n\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k\n\\]\n\nSimplifying each term, we can write:\n\n\\[\n\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\times c^{-k} = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n\\]\n\nWe need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, because that's the constant term. So, set the exponent equal to zero:\n\n\\[\n6 - 2k = 0\n\\]\n\nSolving for \\(k\\):\n\n\\[\n6 = 2k \\implies k = 3\n\\]\n\nSo, the constant term is when \\(k = 3\\), and the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Let me compute that:\n\n\\[\n\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3! \\times (6 - 3)!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\n\\]\n\nWait, no, that's not right. Wait, 6! is 720, but 3! is 6, so 6!/(3!3!) = 720/(6\u00d76) = 720/36 = 20. Yes, that's correct. So, the constant term is 20.\n\nSo, going back to the original problem, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion has a coefficient of 6, and the constant term in the second expansion is 20. Since these two are multiplied together in the overall expression, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product will be 6 \u00d7 20 = 120.\n\nWait, let me make sure I didn't miss anything. The first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), gives \\(a^2b^2\\) with coefficient 6, and the second part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), gives a constant term of 20. So, when you multiply the two expansions, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But only the constant term (20) will result in a term that is just \\(a^2b^2\\), without any \\(c\\) terms. The other terms in the second expansion will introduce \\(c\\) powers, so they won't contribute to the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the product. Therefore, the coefficient is indeed 6 \u00d7 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Is there another way to approach this problem? Maybe by considering the entire expansion and looking for all possible combinations that result in \\(a^2b^2\\). But since the second part doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), it's only the product of the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part and the constant term from the second part that contributes to the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the overall expression. So, yes, the coefficient should be 6 \u00d7 20 = 120.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can think of the entire expression as a product of two independent expansions, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the product of the coefficients of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part. That's exactly what I did earlier, so that seems correct.\n\nWait, just to double-check, let me compute the binomial coefficients again. For the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) which is 6. For the second part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\) which is 20. Multiplying them gives 120. That seems right.\n\nI think I'm confident that the coefficient is 120. So, the final answer should be 120, which in the required format is \\boxed{120}.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem for both parts of the expression.\n\nFirst, we expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n\\]\nThe term containing \\(a^2b^2\\) is when \\(k = 2\\), which gives:\n\\[\n\\dbinom{4}{2} a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\n\\]\nSo, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\nNext, we consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem:\n\\[\n\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n\\]\nWe need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, which occurs when:\n\\[\n6 - 2k = 0 \\implies k = 3\n\\]\nThe coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\), which is:\n\\[\n\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\n\\]\n\nSince the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion is multiplied by the constant term from the second expansion, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is:\n\\[\n6 \\times 20 = 120\n\\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}."

Calculating the coefficients, that's \\(1a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + 1b^4\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) here is 6. But wait, the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), so I need to consider that as well.\n\nHmm, but the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Since the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\), and the rest of the expression is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), does that mean the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just 6 times whatever the constant term is in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)? Because when you multiply, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will be multiplied by every term in the other expansion, but only the constant term (the term without \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\)) will contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). \n\nWait, let me make sure. So, when we multiply two expressions, each term in the first expression is multiplied by each term in the second. So, \\((a + b)^4\\) gives terms with \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) gives terms with \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), that term is only affected by the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) because the other part doesn't have \\(a\\) or \\(b\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression should be 6 multiplied by the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) that result in a constant term (i.e., terms where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero). \n\nWait, actually, no. Because when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each polynomial. But in this case, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term is only present in the first polynomial, \\((a + b)^4\\), and the second polynomial, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), only has terms with \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), so when you multiply them, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will be multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. But the question is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would be the sum of all the products where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any term in the second polynomial. But wait, no, because \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term in the first polynomial, and when you multiply by the second polynomial, each term in the second polynomial will have \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), so the resulting terms will have \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2 \\cdot (1/c)^k\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) itself, without any \\(c\\) terms, would only come from the term in the second polynomial where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, because that's the only term that doesn't introduce any \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\) factors. \n\nSo, to clarify, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because when you multiply, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial, but only the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero will result in a term that's just \\(a^2b^2\\). All other terms will have \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\) factors, so they won't contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). \n\nTherefore, I need to find two things: \n1. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which I already found as 6.\n2. The coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nLet me tackle the second part. The expression is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Again, I can use the binomial theorem here. The expansion will be \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k\\). Simplifying that, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\cdot c^{-k} = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). \n\nI need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, so I set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the term where \\(k = 3\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} c^{0}\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20.\n\nNow, going back to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the two coefficients we found: 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the second part). So, 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, let me double-check that. So, the first coefficient is 6, which is correct because in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Then, in the second part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the constant term is when \\(k = 3\\), which gives \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, multiplying them together gives 6 * 20 = 120. That seems right.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of it as the entire expression being the product of two polynomials, and when you multiply them, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just the product of the coefficients from each part where the exponents match. Since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the only term in the second polynomial that affects it is the constant term. So, yeah, 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nI think that's correct. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Multiplying these gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\boxed{120}"

But since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), the coefficients involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) won't be affected by the \\(c\\) terms, right? \n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think again. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficients multiply. But actually, no, that's not quite right. Because when you multiply, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial, but the variables are different, so terms like \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part will just be multiplied by all the terms in the second part, but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), the coefficient will just be the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all coefficients in the second part. \n\nWait, no, that doesn't sound right either. Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by something involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), you end up with terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2/c^k\\), but the original problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not considering \\(c\\). So, does that mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)? But that can't be right because the coefficient should be a number, not a polynomial. \n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. It says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\" in the entire expression. But in the entire expression, each term is a product of a term from \\((a + b)^4\\) and a term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when you multiply them, the variables are separate. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second part, which are powers of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will appear multiple times in the product, each multiplied by different powers of \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). \n\nWait, that doesn't make sense because in the product, each term will have both \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) exponents and \\(c\\) exponents. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by different powers of \\(c\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually be the sum of all the coefficients from the second expansion, because each term in the second expansion is being multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). \n\nWait, no, that can't be right. Because if you have \\(a^2b^2 \\times \\left(c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15c^{-2} + 6c^{-4} + c^{-6}\\right)\\), then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would actually be \\(6 \\times (1 + 6 + 15 + 20 + 15 + 6 + 1)\\), because each term in the second expansion is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), and we're just looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). \n\nWait, but that would mean the coefficient is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion. But the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion is found by plugging in \\(c = 1\\), so \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). \n\nBut wait, let me make sure. Let me think again. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6. Then, when we multiply by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in the second expansion is a coefficient times some power of \\(c\\). So, when we multiply 6 by each of these terms, we get 6 times each coefficient, but each multiplied by a different power of \\(c\\). However, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in the entire product, \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each of the terms in the second expansion, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is actually the sum of all the coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by 6. \n\nWait, but that's not correct because each term in the product will have both \\(a^2b^2\\) and some power of \\(c\\). So, if we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) term, then we need to sum all the coefficients from the second expansion because each term in the second expansion contributes to a term with \\(a^2b^2\\) and some power of \\(c\\). \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some specific \\(k\\), but the problem doesn't specify, so I think it's just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 times 64, which is 384. \n\nBut let me check this another way. Let's expand both parts separately and see how they multiply. \n\nFirst, \\((a + b)^4\\) is \\(a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). \n\nNow, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) can be expanded using the binomial theorem as well. Let's do that. \n\n\\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(1/c\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). \n\nCalculating each term:\n\n- When \\(k=0\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{0}c^6 = 1 \\times c^6 = c^6\\)\n- \\(k=1\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{1}c^{4} = 6c^4\\)\n- \\(k=2\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{2}c^{2} = 15c^2\\)\n- \\(k=3\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}c^{0} = 20\\)\n- \\(k=4\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{4}c^{-2} = 15c^{-2}\\)\n- \\(k=5\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{5}c^{-4} = 6c^{-4}\\)\n- \\(k=6\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{6}c^{-6} = c^{-6}\\)\n\nSo, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15c^{-2} + 6c^{-4} + c^{-6}\\).\n\nNow, when we multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, resulting in terms like \\(6a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(6a^2b^2 \\times 6c^4\\), \\(6a^2b^2 \\times 15c^2\\), and so on. \n\nBut the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in the entire product, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the sum of all the coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by 6. Because each term in the second expansion is a coefficient times a power of \\(c\\), and when multiplied by \\(6a^2b^2\\), it becomes that coefficient times \\(a^2b^2\\) times the power of \\(c\\). So, if we collect all the terms with \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. \n\nThe sum of the coefficients in the second expansion is found by plugging in \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1/1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). \n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. Another way to think about it is that when you have two polynomials multiplied together, the coefficient of a specific term in one polynomial is multiplied by all the terms in the other polynomial. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial. \n\nYes, that makes sense because each term in the second polynomial is a coefficient times some power of \\(c\\), and when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), it contributes to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times that power of \\(c\\). So, if we're just looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), we need to sum all those contributions, which is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second polynomial. \n\nTherefore, the sum of the coefficients in the second polynomial is 64, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nI think that makes sense. Let me just double-check by considering a simpler case. Suppose we have \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, expanding, \\((a + b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2\\), and \\((c + 1/c)^1 = c + 1/c\\). Multiplying them together, we get \\(a^2c + a^2/c + 2abc + 2ab/c + b^2c + b^2/c\\). Now, the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^2\\) times the sum of the coefficients from \\((c + 1/c)^1\\). The coefficient of \\(a^2\\) in the first part is 1, and the sum of coefficients in the second part is (1 + 1) = 2. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) in the product would be 1 * 2 = 2, which matches the terms \\(a^2c\\) and \\(a^2/c\\) each having coefficient 1, so total coefficient 2. \n\nSimilarly, in our original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the sum of coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, giving 384. \n\nSo, I think that's the correct answer. \n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{384}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem to expand each part separately and then consider the product.\n\nFirst, we expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\dbinom{4}{0}a^4 + \\dbinom{4}{1}a^3b + \\dbinom{4}{2}a^2b^2 + \\dbinom{4}{3}ab^3 + \\dbinom{4}{4}b^4\n\\]\nCalculating the coefficients, we get:\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\n\\]\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in this expansion is 6.\n\nNext, we expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem:\n\\[\n\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n\\]\nCalculating each term, we get:\n\\[\n\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15c^{-2} + 6c^{-4} + c^{-6}\n\\]\nThe sum of the coefficients in this expansion is found by plugging in \\(c = 1\\), which gives:\n\\[\n(1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\n\\]\n\nWhen we multiply the expansions of \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the coefficient from the first part (6) multiplied by the sum of the coefficients from the second part (64).\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is:\n\\[\n6 \\times 64 = 384\n\\]\n\nThe final answer is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{384}\n\\]"

But wait, the problem is not just about \\((a + b)^4\\); it's multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I need to consider the entire expression.\n\nHmm, so I think I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product of two expansions: one from \\((a + b)^4\\) and the other from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from those involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, when I multiply them, the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms won't interact with the \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) terms. That means the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression will just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, that doesn't make sense because when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first polynomial gets multiplied by each term in the second. But since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), maybe the coefficients for \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion? Or perhaps not, because the second expansion has terms with \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), which are separate variables. So, maybe the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is just 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't seem right because the question is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which implies that the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by some expression involving \\(c\\), but the problem is just asking for the coefficient, not the entire term. Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating it.\n\nWait, let me read the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, it's asking for the coefficient of the term \\(a^2b^2\\), which would be a term in the product. But since the product is between two expressions, one in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) and the other in \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), the variables \\(a, b\\) and \\(c\\) are independent. So, when you multiply them, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. Therefore, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion will be multiplied by every term from the second expansion. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would be the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all coefficients from the second part, because each term in the second part will be multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), effectively making \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by the entire second expansion. But that would mean the coefficient is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that can't be right because the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) would be when \\(c = 1\\), which is \\(2^6 = 64\\). So, then the coefficient would be 6 * 64 = 384. But that seems high, and I'm not sure if that's the correct approach.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, which would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all terms in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems a bit off. Alternatively, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that would make the coefficient a polynomial in \\(c\\), not a single number. But the problem is asking for a coefficient, which is usually a number. So perhaps I'm overcomplicating it, and the answer is simply 6, but that seems too easy. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2 each, and the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. That would make sense because then we're looking for a specific term in the product. So, perhaps I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product.\n\nWait, but the problem didn't specify \\(c^0\\), just \\(a^2b^2\\). Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me think again. When you have two separate variables, \\(a, b\\) and \\(c\\), the product will have terms like \\(a^kb^l c^m (1/c)^n\\), which simplifies to \\(a^kb^l c^{m - n}\\). So, if I'm looking for the term \\(a^2b^2\\), then I need to consider all terms in the product where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2 each, regardless of the exponent of \\(c\\). But that would mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which would be a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient, which is usually a number, so perhaps I'm misinterpreting the problem.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\). That makes sense because otherwise, the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\), which isn't typical. So, perhaps I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product. So, let's proceed under that assumption.\n\nSo, first, from \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, as I found earlier. Now, from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\), which is the constant term. Because when we multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by the constant term, we get \\(a^2b^2\\) times that constant, so the coefficient would be 6 times that constant term.\n\nSo, let's find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem again, the expansion is:\n\\[\n\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(1/c\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n\\]\nWe need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, so:\n\\[\n6 - 2k = 0 \\implies 2k = 6 \\implies k = 3\n\\]\nSo, the constant term is when \\(k = 3\\), which is:\n\\[\n\\dbinom{6}{3} c^{0} = 20\n\\]\nSo, the constant term is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire product is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but let me double-check that. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part is 20, so when you multiply them, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is 6 * 20 = 120. That seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem was just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without considering \\(c\\), then it would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which would be a polynomial. But since the problem is asking for a coefficient, which is a number, I think the intended interpretation is that we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nWait, let me think again. The problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\" in the product. Since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term in the product, but in the product, each term also has some power of \\(c\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually be part of multiple terms in the product, each with different powers of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually be the sum of all the coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by 6. But that would mean the coefficient is 6 times the sum of the coefficients of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 2^6 = 6 * 64 = 384. But that doesn't make sense because the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would then be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, leading to terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), etc., each with their own coefficients. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually be a polynomial in \\(c\\), not a single number. Therefore, the problem must be asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is written in a way that it's considering the entire product and wants the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). But that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial, and the coefficient would be that polynomial. But that seems unlikely because the problem is asking for a coefficient, which is a number. Therefore, I think the correct interpretation is that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nWait, let me confirm this approach. So, the product is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). When you expand this, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), \\(a^2b^2c^2\\), \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), \\(a^2b^2c^{-2}\\), etc. Each of these terms has a coefficient. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is ambiguous because \\(a^2b^2\\) could be multiplied by any power of \\(c\\). Therefore, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by 1, i.e., the constant term. That makes sense, so I think that's the intended interpretation.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in calculating the constant term. So, in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - k} \\times (1/c)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\\). We set the exponent to zero: 6 - 2k = 0 \u21d2 k = 3. So, the term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}c^0 = 20\\). So, yes, that's correct.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but let me check again. The problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", not \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). So, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, which would be the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Because when you multiply by the second expansion, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). The sum of coefficients in a polynomial is found by setting all variables to 1. So, in this case, setting \\(c = 1\\), the sum of coefficients is \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 * 64 = 384. But that seems high, and I'm not sure if that's the correct approach.\n\nWait, but if I think about it, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the sum of all terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any term from the second expansion. So, each term in the second expansion is a coefficient times some power of \\(c\\), so when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), the coefficient becomes 6 times each of those coefficients. Therefore, the total coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) across all powers of \\(c\\) would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. But that would mean that the coefficient is a sum over all possible powers of \\(c\\), which might not be the intended question. The problem might be asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, regardless of the power of \\(c\\), which would be 384. But that seems more likely, as the problem didn't specify anything about \\(c\\).\n\nWait, but let me think again. If I have two polynomials, P(a, b) and Q(c), then the product P(a, b) * Q(c) would have terms where each term in P is multiplied by each term in Q. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in P(a, b) multiplied by the entire polynomial Q(c). So, in effect, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 * Q(c), which is a polynomial. But the problem is asking for a coefficient, which is a number, so perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. Alternatively, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of the power of \\(c\\), which would be 6 times the entire expansion of Q(c), but that would make the coefficient a polynomial, not a number. Therefore, perhaps the problem is intended to ask for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is written correctly, and I'm overcomplicating it. Let me check online or recall if there's a standard interpretation. Wait, I think that when variables are separate, the coefficient of a term with specific variables is the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients from the second part. So, in this case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 * (sum of coefficients in Q(c)). The sum of coefficients in Q(c) is when c = 1, which is 2^6 = 64. So, 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nBut let me think about it differently. Let's say I have two polynomials: P(a, b) = (a + b)^4 and Q(c) = (c + 1/c)^6. The product is P(a, b) * Q(c). When I expand this product, each term in P is multiplied by each term in Q. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in P is multiplied by each term in Q, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), etc. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the sum of all coefficients from Q(c) multiplied by 6. So, that would be 6 * (sum of coefficients in Q(c)) = 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but that seems to make sense. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 384. But I'm confused because earlier I thought it was 120. So, which one is correct?\n\nWait, let me clarify. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be present in all terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any term from Q(c). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in Q(c). Because each coefficient in Q(c) is multiplied by 6, and then attached to \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nBut wait, that seems to be the case. Alternatively, if I consider that the product is a polynomial in four variables: a, b, c, and 1/c. So, each term in the product is of the form \\(a^kb^l c^m (1/c)^n\\), which simplifies to \\(a^kb^l c^{m - n}\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be present in the product as \\(a^2b^2 c^m (1/c)^n\\) where m - n = 0, but that's only when considering the term \\(a^2b^2 c^0\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nBut now I'm really confused because depending on the interpretation, the answer could be either 120 or 384. I need to figure out which one is correct.\n\nWait, let's think about what the problem is asking. It says, \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 (c + 1/c)^6\\)?\" So, it's asking for the coefficient of the monomial \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in the product, \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term from the second expansion, each with their own power of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by 6. So, that would be 6 * (sum of coefficients in the second expansion) = 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but that seems to be the case because when you have two polynomials multiplied together, the coefficient of a specific term in one polynomial is multiplied by the entire other polynomial. So, for example, if you have (P(a, b))(Q(c)), then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is (coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in P(a, b)) multiplied by Q(c). So, in this case, it would be 6 * Q(c), which is a polynomial. But the problem is asking for a coefficient, which is a number, so perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is written incorrectly, or I'm misinterpreting it. Let me check the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 (c + 1/c)^6\\)?\" So, it's possible that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of the power of \\(c\\), which would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but that would make the coefficient a polynomial, which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a number. Therefore, the intended interpretation is likely that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nWait, but let me think differently. If I consider that the variables \\(a, b, c\\) are all separate, then the term \\(a^2b^2\\) can be multiplied by any power of \\(c\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). The sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 * 64 = 384. But that seems to be the case when you consider that the coefficient is a polynomial, but the problem is asking for a number, so perhaps that's not the case.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is written as \\((a + b)^4 \\times (c + 1/c)^6\\), and it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would be the same as 6 times the entire expansion of \\((c + 1/c)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a number. Therefore, I think the correct interpretation is that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nWait, but I'm still unsure. Let me think of an example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). So, expanding that, I get \\((a^2 + 2ab + b^2) \\times (c + 1/c)\\). The coefficient of \\(a^2\\) would be 1 times (c + 1/c), which is a polynomial. But if the problem had asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2\\), would it be expecting a polynomial or a number? I think in that case, the problem would have specified that it's looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2c^0\\), which would be 1 * 1 = 1. Alternatively, if it's just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2\\), it would be the polynomial \\(c + 1/c\\), but that's not a number. Therefore, I think the problem must be asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nTherefore, after all this thinking, I believe the correct answer is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then finding the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20. Multiplying these gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\boxed{120}."

    "text": " \n\nSo, expanding \\((a + b)^4\\), the general term will be \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\\), right? Now, I need the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2, because the question is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). That means I need to find the term where \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). Let me calculate that. \n\nSo, when \\(k = 2\\), the term is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} a^{2}b^{2}\\). The binomial coefficient \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) is calculated as \\(\\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), is 6. \n\nNow, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I think I need to consider the expansion of both parts separately and then see how they multiply together. But wait, the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so maybe I don't need to worry about the \\(c\\) terms when looking for the specific term involving \\(a^2b^2\\). \n\nLet me think about this. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the \\((a + b)^4\\) part, right? Because the other part is in terms of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), which don't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\). So, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nBut since the question is only about the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), I think that term will come from multiplying the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first part by the constant term (the term with \\(c^0\\)) in the second part. Because if I multiply by any other term from the second expansion, it would introduce a \\(c\\) term, which isn't part of \\(a^2b^2\\). \n\nSo, now I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me expand that part. Using the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying each term, that becomes \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). \n\nI need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero because that's the constant term. So, I set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), I get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} c^{0}\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). \n\nSo, the constant term in the second part is 20. Now, going back to the original expression, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is multiplied by the constant term 20 in the second part. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the second part). \n\nCalculating that, 6 * 20 = 120. So, the coefficient should be 120. \n\nWait, let me double-check that. In the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6. In the second part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the constant term is when \\(m=3\\), which gives \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}=20\\). So, when I multiply these two, 6 * 20 is 120. That makes sense because each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, but since we're only interested in the term where the \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by the constant term, the other terms involving \\(c\\) won't affect the coefficient we're looking for. \n\nSo, I think I did this correctly. The coefficient is 120.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):\n\n1. Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem. The term with \\(a^2b^2\\) has the coefficient \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n\n2. Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem. The constant term (where \\(c^0\\)) is found when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, which occurs at \\(m = 3\\), giving \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n\n3. Multiply the coefficients from each expansion: \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

I'm interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). That means I need the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2. So, let's set \\(4 - k = 2\\) for \\(a\\), which gives \\(k = 2\\). Therefore, the term is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} a^{2}b^{2}\\). \n\nCalculating the binomial coefficient, \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) is \\(\\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. \n\nNow, the original expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).

Because when you multiply two expressions together, the coefficients of the terms in the product are the products of the coefficients of the terms from each expression. But in this case, the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms are only in the first part, and \\(c\\) terms are only in the second part. So, actually, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the product will only come from the product of the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first expression and the constant term (if any) in the second expression. But wait, the second expression is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me check if it has a constant term. \n\nTo find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), I can use the binomial theorem again. The expansion is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). The constant term occurs when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. So, \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which gives \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\), which is 20. \n\nSo, the constant term in the second expression is 20. Therefore, when I multiply the two expressions together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) will be the coefficient from the first expression, which is 6, multiplied by the constant term from the second expression, which is 20. So, 6 times 20 is 120. \n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not missing anything. So, the first part gives me \\(6a^2b^2\\) and the second part gives me \\(20\\) when considering the constant term. So, when I multiply these two, I get \\(6 \\times 20 \\times a^2b^2 = 120a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient is 120. \n\nBut let me double-check my steps.

Then, I considered the second part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), and found that it has a constant term of 20. Multiplying these together gives 6 * 20 = 120.

But wait, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Hmm, that's a product of two expressions. So, I think I need to consider how the terms from each expansion multiply together.\n\nLet me denote the first part as \\(A = (a + b)^4\\) and the second part as \\(B = \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the entire expression is \\(A \\times B\\). Now, when I multiply two polynomials, the coefficients of the resulting terms are found by multiplying the coefficients of terms from each polynomial where the exponents add up appropriately.\n\nBut wait, in this case, since \\(A\\) contains terms only with \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and \\(B\\) contains terms only with \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), the variables are different. So, when I multiply \\(A\\) and \\(B\\), the variables \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) won't interact with \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\). That means, each term in \\(A\\) will be multiplied by each term in \\(B\\), but since they have different variables, the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) in the product will remain the same as in \\(A\\), and the exponents of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) will come from \\(B\\). \n\nBut the problem specifically asks for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, in the product \\(A \\times B\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from \\(A\\) will be multiplied by every term in \\(B\\). However, since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\), I think that the coefficient will actually be the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(A\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(B\\). Wait, no, that's not quite right. Let me think again.\n\nWait, actually, no. Because when you multiply \\(A\\) by \\(B\\), each term in \\(A\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(B\\), but since \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) have different variables, the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) in the product will only come from \\(A\\), and the exponents of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) will come from \\(B\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will come from the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) in \\(A\\) multiplied by each term in \\(B\\). But since \\(B\\) is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), when expanded, it will have terms like \\(c^6\\), \\(c^4\\), \\(c^2\\), \\(c^0\\), \\(c^{-2}\\), \\(c^{-4}\\), \\(c^{-6}\\), each multiplied by their respective coefficients. \n\nBut wait, in the product \\(A \\times B\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will have the coefficient \\(6\\) multiplied by each coefficient from \\(B\\). However, since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\), it means that in the product, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is actually \\(6\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(B\\). But that doesn't sound right because the coefficients in \\(B\\) are not just numbers; they depend on the exponents of \\(c\\). Wait, no, actually, each term in \\(B\\) is a coefficient times a power of \\(c\\). So, when we multiply \\(6a^2b^2\\) by each term in \\(B\\), we get terms like \\(6 \\times \\text{coefficient from } B \\times a^2b^2 \\times c^{\\text{something}}\\). \n\nBut the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). Wait, that can't be right because \\(a^2b^2\\) is only present in \\(A\\), and when multiplied by \\(B\\), it would be present in the product as \\(a^2b^2\\) times each term in \\(B\\). So, actually, in the product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would have coefficients multiplied by each term in \\(B\\). But that would mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is \\(6\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(B\\), which would be a polynomial in \\(c\\). \n\nWait, but the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so maybe it's considering the entire expression as a polynomial in \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\), and it's asking for the coefficient of the term where \\(a\\) is squared, \\(b\\) is squared, and \\(c\\) is... well, anything. So, in other words, it's asking for the sum of all coefficients where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2 and 2, respectively, and the exponent of \\(c\\) can be anything. \n\nSo, that would mean that the coefficient is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(A\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(B\\). Because when you multiply \\(6a^2b^2\\) by each term in \\(B\\), you get \\(6a^2b^2 \\times \\text{each term in } B\\), and the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the sum of all the coefficients from \\(B\\) multiplied by 6. \n\nSo, first, let me find the sum of all coefficients in \\(B\\). \\(B\\) is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The sum of all coefficients in a polynomial is found by substituting \\(c = 1\\). So, substituting \\(c = 1\\) into \\(B\\), we get:\n\n\\[\n\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = (1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\n\\]\n\nSo, the sum of all coefficients in \\(B\\) is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\(A \\times B\\) would be \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). \n\nWait, but let me double-check that. Because when I multiply \\(6a^2b^2\\) by each term in \\(B\\), which is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in \\(B\\) is a coefficient times a power of \\(c\\). So, when I multiply \\(6a^2b^2\\) by each term, I get terms like \\(6 \\times \\text{coefficient} \\times a^2b^2c^k\\), where \\(k\\) is some exponent. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\) would indeed be the sum of all these coefficients multiplied by 6, which is 6 times the sum of coefficients in \\(B\\), which is 64. So, 6 times 64 is 384. \n\nAlternatively, another way to think about it is that in the product \\(A \\times B\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is present in \\(A\\) with coefficient 6, and when multiplied by each term in \\(B\\), it's just 6 times each term in \\(B\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(B\\), but since we're only interested in the coefficient, it's 6 times the sum of coefficients in \\(B\\), which is 64. So, 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I can approach this differently. Let me consider the entire expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I can think of this as the product of two independent binomial expansions. So, when I multiply them together, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. \n\nSo, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the first expansion, and it has a coefficient of 6. Then, when I multiply this term by each term in the second expansion, which is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), I get terms of the form \\(6a^2b^2c^k\\), where \\(k\\) ranges from -6 to 6 in steps of 2. \n\nBut the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in the product, all the terms that have \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by any power of \\(c\\) will have coefficients that are 6 times the coefficients from \\(B\\). Therefore, the total coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) across all powers of \\(c\\) is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(B\\), which is 64, as calculated before. So, 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nWait, but let me think again. Is that correct? Because when you have a product of two polynomials, the coefficients of the product are the products of the coefficients of the terms whose exponents add up to the exponent in the product. But in this case, since \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) are in different variables, the exponents in \\(A\\) (which are \\(a\\) and \\(b\\)) don't interfere with the exponents in \\(B\\) (which are \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\)). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(A\\) is just multiplied by every term in \\(B\\), and thus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(B\\). \n\nAlternatively, if I consider that the product is a polynomial in three variables \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\), then the term \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) would have a coefficient equal to the product of the coefficients of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(A\\) and \\(c^k\\) in \\(B\\). But the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, that would mean that we are summing over all possible \\(k\\) the coefficients of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\). \n\nSo, mathematically, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the sum over all \\(k\\) of (coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(A\\) times coefficient of \\(c^k\\) in \\(B\\)). But since \\(A\\) only has \\(a^2b^2\\) once with coefficient 6, and \\(B\\) has coefficients for each \\(c^k\\), the total coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(B\\), which is 64. Therefore, 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nWait, but another way to think about it is that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is equal to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(A\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(B\\), but since we're only interested in the coefficient, it's 6 times the sum of the coefficients in \\(B\\). So, that's 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I can consider that when you have two polynomials multiplied together, the coefficient of a term that involves variables from both polynomials would require specific exponents. But in this case, since \\(a^2b^2\\) only involves \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and \\(B\\) only involves \\(c\\), the variables are separate. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(A\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(B\\). But since we're just looking for the coefficient, not the entire term, it's 6 times the sum of the coefficients in \\(B\\), which is 64, giving 384. \n\nWait, but let me check if I'm not missing something. Let me think about the expansion of \\(B = \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem, this expands to:\n\n\\[\n\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n\\]\n\nSo, the exponents of \\(c\\) go from \\(6\\) down to \\(-6\\) in steps of 2. So, the coefficients are \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}\\) for \\(k = 0\\) to \\(6\\). The sum of all these coefficients is when \\(c = 1\\), as I did before, which is \\(2^6 = 64\\). \n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is indeed 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not overcomplicating this. Another approach: since the variables in \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) are independent, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(A\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(B\\). But since the problem is just asking for the coefficient, not the entire term, it's 6 times the sum of the coefficients in \\(B\\), which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can think of it as the product of the two expressions, and since \\(a^2b^2\\) is only in \\(A\\), the coefficient in the product is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in \\(B\\). \n\nWait, but maybe I can also think of it as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(A\\) times the coefficient of any term in \\(B\\), but that's not quite right because each term in \\(B\\) is a different power of \\(c\\). So, perhaps the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(B\\), which is 64, giving 384. \n\nWait, but let me check with a smaller example to see if this makes sense. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^1 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, expanding \\((a + b)(c + 1/c)\\), the coefficient of \\(a^1b^0\\) would be 1 times the sum of coefficients in \\(c + 1/c\\), which is 1 + 1 = 2, so 1 * 2 = 2. Similarly, the coefficient of \\(a^0b^1\\) would also be 1 * 2 = 2. \n\nBut in reality, expanding \\((a + b)(c + 1/c)\\), we get \\(ac + a/c + bc + b/c\\). So, the coefficients of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2, which matches the calculation. So, in this case, the coefficient of \\(a^1b^0\\) is 2, which is 1 (from \\(a + b\\)) times 2 (sum of coefficients in \\(c + 1/c\\)). \n\nSimilarly, if I take \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^0\\) would be \\(\\dbinom{2}{0} = 1\\) times 2, giving 2. But expanding \\((a + b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2\\), so the product would be \\(a^2c + a^2/c + 2abc + 2ab/c + b^2c + b^2/c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) is 2, which is 1 * 2. Similarly, the coefficient of \\(b^2\\) is 2, which is 1 * 2. \n\nWait, but in this case, the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) is 2, which is the same as the coefficient in the first part times the sum of coefficients in the second part. So, that seems to confirm that the approach is correct. \n\nTherefore, going back to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 6 (from \\(A\\)) times 64 (sum of coefficients in \\(B\\)), which is 384. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can think of it as the product of the two expansions, and the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the same as the coefficient in \\(A\\) times the entire expansion of \\(B\\), but since we're only interested in the coefficient, it's 6 times 64. \n\nWait, but let me make sure that I'm not missing any negative signs or anything. In \\(B = \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), all the coefficients are positive because both terms are positive, so when I substitute \\(c = 1\\), I get 64, which is correct. So, there are no negative terms to worry about. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can compute the expansion of \\(B\\) and then see what the sum of coefficients is. But as we saw earlier, substituting \\(c = 1\\) gives the sum of coefficients as 64. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not confusing the exponents. Since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term in \\(A\\), and when multiplied by each term in \\(B\\), it just adds more variables, but the coefficient remains 6 times the coefficient from \\(B\\). But since we're summing over all coefficients in \\(B\\), it's 6 * 64. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can think of the entire product as a polynomial where the variables \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are independent, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) is 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^k\\) in \\(B\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\) is the sum over all \\(k\\) of (6 * coefficient of \\(c^k\\) in \\(B\\)), which is 6 times the sum of coefficients in \\(B\\), which is 64. So, 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nTherefore, after all this thinking and checking with smaller examples, I'm confident that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\boxed{384}."

Calculating the coefficients, that would be \\(1a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + 1b^4\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) here is 6. \n\nWait, but the original expression isn't just \\((a + b)^4\\); it's multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I need to consider how this multiplication affects the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Let me think about this. \n\nSince the two parts of the expression are multiplied together, each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). That means I don't need to worry about the terms involving \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\) because \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't have any \\(c\\) terms. So, effectively, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression will just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, that doesn't make sense because when you multiply two expressions, each term from the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nWait, no, that's not quite right. Let me clarify. When you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second, and the coefficients add up only when the variables match. But in this case, since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\), and \\(1/c\\) are all different variables, the only way \\(a^2b^2\\) can appear in the product is if it comes from a term in \\((a + b)^4\\) that's \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by any term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because the variables \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) don't interfere with \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). \n\nSo, in other words, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) has a coefficient, and when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each of these terms, each will contribute to the overall coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. \n\nSo, first, I already found that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. Now, I need to find the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). How do I do that? Well, the sum of all coefficients in a polynomial is found by plugging in 1 for all the variables. So, if I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\dfrac{1}{c} = 1\\) as well. Therefore, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) when \\(c = 1\\) becomes \\((1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). \n\nSo, the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 multiplied by 64, which is 384. \n\nWait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake here. Another way to think about it is that when you have two independent variables, \\(a, b\\) and \\(c\\), the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from those involving \\(c\\). So, when you multiply the two expressions, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed the product of the coefficients from each part, since there's no overlap in variables. So, 6 times 64 is 384. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of it as the entire expression being the product of two separate expansions. So, the first expansion contributes a coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\), which is 6, and the second expansion contributes a total of 64 when all the coefficients are added together. Therefore, when you multiply them, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second, but since I'm only interested in the \\(a^2b^2\\) term, I just need to take the coefficient from the first part and multiply it by the sum of coefficients from the second part, because each term in the second part will multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term without affecting the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) exponents. \n\nYeah, that makes sense. So, I think 384 is the correct coefficient. Let me just double-check my calculations. \n\nFirst, \\((a + b)^4\\): the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). That's correct. \n\nThen, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\): the sum of coefficients is when \\(c = 1\\), so \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). Correct. \n\nMultiplying 6 and 64 gives 384. So, yeah, I think that's right. \n\nI don't think I made any mistakes here. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 384.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{384}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem.\n\nFirst, we expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n\\]\nThe term containing \\(a^2b^2\\) is:\n\\[\n\\dbinom{4}{2} a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\n\\]\nSo, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\nNext, we consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).

    "text": " \n\nUsing the binomial theorem, \\((a + b)^4\\) will have terms from \\(a^4\\) down to \\(b^4\\). The general term is \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\\) where \\(k\\) goes from 0 to 4. So, the coefficients for each term will be the binomial coefficients for 4 choose k. Let me write them out:\n\n- When \\(k = 0\\), the term is \\(\\dbinom{4}{0} a^4 b^0 = 1 \\cdot a^4 = a^4\\).\n- When \\(k = 1\\), the term is \\(\\dbinom{4}{1} a^3 b^1 = 4a^3b\\).\n- When \\(k = 2\\), the term is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} a^2 b^2 = 6a^2b^2\\).\n- When \\(k = 3\\), the term is \\(\\dbinom{4}{3} a^1 b^3 = 4ab^3\\).\n- When \\(k = 4\\), the term is \\(\\dbinom{4}{4} a^0 b^4 = 1 \\cdot b^4 = b^4\\).\n\nSo, in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. That seems straightforward. \n\nNow, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait a second, so this entire expression is a product of two binomials raised to powers. So, I think I need to consider both expansions. \n\nLet me denote the first part as \\(A = (a + b)^4\\) and the second part as \\(B = \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the expression is \\(A \\times B\\). Now, when I multiply these two, each term in \\(A\\) will be multiplied by each term in \\(B\\). But since I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I should figure out how \\(a^2b^2\\) is affected by the multiplication with \\(B\\). \n\nWait, but \\(B\\) is in terms of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), while \\(A\\) is in terms of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). So, when I multiply them together, the variables \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\). That means that the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) in \\(A\\) won't affect the terms involving \\(c\\) in \\(B\\), and vice versa. So, when I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), it's actually the same as the coefficient in \\(A\\) times the entire expansion of \\(B\\), because \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\) at all. \n\nWait, is that correct? Let me think again. So, if I have \\(A = (a + b)^4\\) and \\(B = \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), then \\(A \\times B\\) is a product where each term in \\(A\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(B\\). So, each term in \\(A\\) is something like \\(a^{4 - k}b^k\\) and each term in \\(B\\) is something like \\(c^{6 - m} \\times (1/c)^m = c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, when you multiply them, you get terms like \\(a^{4 - k}b^k c^{6 - 2m}\\). \n\nNow, since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\) at all, that would mean that in the product \\(A \\times B\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(B\\), right? Because any term in \\(B\\) multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\) would give a term involving \\(a^2b^2c^{...}\\), but if we're just looking for \\(a^2b^2\\), that would require the exponent on \\(c\\) to be zero, meaning \\(c^0 = 1\\). So, only the constant term in \\(B\\) would contribute to \\(a^2b^2\\). \n\nWait, that makes sense. So, to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(A\\) multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(B\\). Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by the constant term in \\(B\\), you get \\(a^2b^2 \\times 1 = a^2b^2\\), which is the term we're interested in. All other terms in \\(B\\) would introduce a \\(c\\) term, which would make the product have \\(a^2b^2c^{...}\\), which isn't just \\(a^2b^2\\).\n\nSo, first, let's find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(A\\), which we already did earlier. It's 6. Now, let's find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(B = \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\), which is the constant term, in the expansion of \\(B\\), we can use the binomial theorem again. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying the exponent on \\(c\\), we have \\(c^{6 - m} \\times c^{-m} = c^{6 - 2m}\\). \n\nWe want the exponent on \\(c\\) to be zero, so we set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). So, the term where \\(m = 3\\) is the constant term. The coefficient for this term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\), which is 20. \n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(B\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression \\(A \\times B\\) is the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(A\\) and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(B\\). That is, \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). \n\nWait, let me double-check that. So, in \\(A = (a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. In \\(B = \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. So, when I multiply these two, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from \\(A\\) gets multiplied by 20 from \\(B\\), giving a total coefficient of 120 for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product. \n\nIs there any other way this could be approached? Maybe by expanding both expressions and multiplying, but that seems more complicated. Alternatively, perhaps using multinomial coefficients, but I think the approach I took is correct. \n\nWait, another thought: when multiplying two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term is the sum of the products of coefficients of terms whose variables multiply to give the desired term. But in this case, since \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) are separate in variables, the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is by taking \\(a^2b^2\\) from \\(A\\) and the constant term from \\(B\\). Because if you take any other term from \\(B\\), you'd introduce a \\(c\\) term, which would make the product have \\(a^2b^2c^{k}\\), which isn't the same as \\(a^2b^2\\). So, yeah, I think my approach is correct.\n\nSo, to recap:\n\n1. Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is 6.\n2. Expand \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem and find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\), which is 20.\n3. Multiply these two coefficients together to get the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, which is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nI think that's it. So, the coefficient should be 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem for both parts of the expression.\n\n1. **Expanding \\((a + b)^4\\)**:\n   Using the binomial theorem, the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is:\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term involving \\(a^2b^2\\) is when \\(k = 2\\):\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} a^2 b^2 = 6a^2b^2\n   \\]\n   So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\n2. **Expanding \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)**:\n   Using the binomial theorem, the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is:\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n   \\]\n   We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, i.e., \\(6 - 2m = 0\\).

Calculating the coefficients, that's \\(1a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + 1b^4\\). Okay, so the term with \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(6a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient from the first part is 6.\n\nNow, the second part of the expression is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I'm not sure if I need to expand this part as well. Wait, but the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, does that mean I don't need to worry about the \\(c\\) terms? Hmm, maybe not, because \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\). So, perhaps the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the entire second part. But that doesn't seem right because the second part is raised to the 6th power, which might have multiple terms. Wait, no, actually, since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and the second part is in terms of \\(c\\), which is a different variable, the \\(c\\) terms won't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. So, maybe the coefficient is just 6 times whatever the coefficient is in the second part for the term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), but that seems confusing. Wait, no, actually, since the second part is multiplied by the first part, and we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), that means we can treat the second part as a constant with respect to \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would just be the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the entire second part evaluated at whatever it is. Wait, but that doesn't make sense because the second part isn't a constant; it's another binomial expansion.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and \\(c\\) is a separate variable, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be the product of \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part and any term from the second part, but since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the term from the second part must be the term where the exponents of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) cancel out, so that the term is a constant. Because if I have \\(a^2b^2\\) times something involving \\(c\\), it won't be just \\(a^2b^2\\); it will have \\(c\\) terms attached. So, to get a term that's just \\(a^2b^2\\), the second part must contribute a term that's a constant, i.e., where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. So, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nAlright, so let's work on that. The expression \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) can be expanded using the binomial theorem as well. The general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - k}\\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\\). We want the exponent of \\(c\\) to be zero, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). So, the term where \\(k=3\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}c^{0}\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20.\n\nTherefore, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, and the coefficient from the second part, which is 20. So, 6 times 20 is 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120.\n\nWait, let me double-check that. So, \\((a + b)^4\\) gives \\(a^2b^2\\) with coefficient 6, and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) gives a constant term (c^0) with coefficient 20. So, when you multiply the two expansions together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by 20, giving 6 * 20 = 120. That seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of the entire expression as the product of two polynomials, one in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the other in \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). Since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are different variables, the terms in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are independent of those in \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial and the constant term (i.e., the term with \\(c^0\\)) in the second polynomial. So, that's 6 * 20 = 120. Yeah, that makes sense.\n\nI think I'm confident that the coefficient is 120. So, the answer should be 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem for both parts of the expression.\n\nFirst, we expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n\\]\nThe term containing \\(a^2b^2\\) is when \\(k = 2\\):\n\\[\n\\dbinom{4}{2} a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\n\\]\nSo, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in this part is 6.\n\nNext, we consider the second part \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. Using the binomial theorem:\n\\[\n\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n\\]\nWe need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero:\n\\[\n6 - 2k = 0 \\implies k = 3\n\\]\nThe coefficient of this term is:\n\\[\n\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\n\\]\n\nSince the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficients from both parts, we multiply 6 by 20:\n\\[\n6 \\times 20 = 120\n\\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

I need the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so let me see what value of \\(k\\) gives me that term. If \\(4 - k = 2\\), then \\(k = 2\\). So the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6. \n\nNow, the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I need to consider how this affects the coefficient. Wait, but actually, since I'm only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), maybe I don't need to worry about the \\(c\\) terms because they are separate variables. So, perhaps the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just the same as the coefficient in \\((a + b)^4\\), multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, no, that might not be correct because the entire expression is the product of two expansions. So, maybe the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just 6 times the sum of all terms in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that can't be right because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which implies that it's a single term, not multiplied by any \\(c\\) terms. Wait, so perhaps I'm overcomplicating this.\n\nWait, let me think again. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. But since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the second part is in \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), maybe the \\(c\\) terms don't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't make sense because the coefficient should be a number, not a polynomial. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, considering all possible terms. But that would require considering how the terms from both expansions interact. But since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are different variables, the only way \\(a^2b^2\\) can appear is from the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), and the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), would contribute a term that doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\). So, perhaps the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't seem right either because the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) would be when \\(c = 1\\), so substituting \\(c = 1\\), we get \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, would the coefficient be 6 * 64 = 384? That seems high. Wait, but I'm not sure if that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), maybe it's just 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 64, as I thought earlier. So, 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me check that again. The sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is indeed found by setting \\(c = 1\\), giving \\(2^6 = 64\\). So, if I have 6 from the first part, then the total coefficient would be 6 * 64 = 384. But I'm not entirely sure if that's the correct approach because I'm treating the entire expansion as a single coefficient, which might not be accurate.\n\nWait, another way to think about it is that each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first part, and it's multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, yes, 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nBut wait, let me confirm by expanding \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem, the expansion is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). The sum of all coefficients would be when \\(c = 1\\), so each term becomes \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\), and the sum is \\(2^6 = 64\\), as I thought.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 * 64 = 384. Therefore, the answer should be 384.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Is there a possibility that the term \\(a^2b^2\\) could be affected by the second expansion in a way that I'm not considering? For example, maybe the second expansion could produce terms that, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), result in a term that still has \\(a^2b^2\\). But no, because \\(c\\) and \\(a\\), \\(b\\) are different variables, so their exponents don't interfere. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed just 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64. So, 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and not considering the second part at all. But that doesn't make sense because the entire expression is the product of both parts. So, the coefficient should account for both parts.\n\nWait, perhaps I should think of it as the product of two independent expansions. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first part, and it's multiplied by every term in the second part. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64. So, 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, and the second part is a distraction. But that seems unlikely. The problem says \"in \\((a + b)^4 (c + 1/c)^6\\)\", so it's the product, so I have to consider both parts.\n\nWait, another approach: since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are separate variables, the only way \\(a^2b^2\\) can appear in the product is by taking \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part and any term from the second part. So, the coefficient would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part. So, that's 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem had asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some \\(k\\), then I would have to find a specific term in the second expansion. But since it's just \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\), I think the coefficient is 384.\n\nWait, but let me check my calculations again. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is indeed \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). The sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, 6 * 64 = 384. That seems correct.\n\nWait, but maybe I'm misapplying the concept. Let me think of it as multiplying two polynomials. Each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial is multiplied by every term in the second polynomial. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial. So, yes, 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me confirm by considering a simpler case. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^1 (c + 1/c)^1\\). The coefficient of \\(a^1b^0\\) would be 1 from the first part, and the sum of coefficients in the second part is 2, so the coefficient of \\(a^1b^0\\) in the product would be 1 * 2 = 2. Let's check: \\((a + b)(c + 1/c) = a c + a/c + b c + b/c. So, the coefficient of \\(a\\) is c + 1/c, but since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^1b^0\\), it's c + 1/c. But that's a term, not a number. Wait, so maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, treating all variables together. But in that case, since \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) are separate, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by each term from the second expansion. So, the coefficient would be 6 times each term from the second expansion. But that would mean the coefficient isn't a single number but a sum involving \\(c\\). But the problem asks for the coefficient, implying a numerical value. So, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which would mean it's 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, so 384.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is phrased as \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\" in the entire expression, which is a product, so it's 6 times the entire expansion of the second part. But that would make the coefficient a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the problem asks for a coefficient, which is a number. So, perhaps the problem is only considering the part with \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), ignoring the \\(c\\) terms, which would make the coefficient just 6. But that seems unlikely.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to clarify. The problem is: What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 (c + 1/c)^6\\). So, in the entire expansion, we're looking for terms where the variables are \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by any combination of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But since the problem asks for the coefficient, which is a number, perhaps it's just 6, because the \\(c\\) terms are separate. But that doesn't seem right because the product would have multiple terms involving \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by different powers of \\(c\\).\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Maybe the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and the second part is a distraction. But that seems unlikely because the entire expression is given as the product.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is written incorrectly, and it's supposed to be \\((a + b)^4 (c + 1)^6\\), but no, it's written as \\((c + 1/c)^6\\). Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where \\(c\\) cancels out, so the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. That would mean we need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\) in the entire product.\n\nIf that's the case, then we need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), and then multiply those two coefficients together.\n\nSo, let's try that approach. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, as before. Now, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is the middle term when the exponent is even. Using the binomial theorem, the general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We want the exponent of \\(c\\) to be 0, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which gives \\(m = 3\\). So, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire product is 6 * 20 = 120. So, the answer would be 120.\n\nWait, that makes more sense because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but perhaps implicitly considering the term where \\(c\\) is balanced, i.e., \\(c^0\\). So, maybe the problem is intended to be asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nBut the problem as stated is: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 (c + 1/c)^6\\)\". So, strictly speaking, it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). But in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for a coefficient, which is a number, so perhaps it's intended to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is only considering the part with \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) and ignores the \\(c\\) terms, making the coefficient just 6. But that seems unlikely because the entire expression is given as a product.\n\nWait, let me check online for similar problems. Wait, I can't actually do that, but I can reason through it. If the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, then it's 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 64, so 6*64=384. But if it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it's 6*20=120.\n\nGiven that the problem is written as is, I think it's more likely that it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which would be 384. But I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, maybe the problem expects the answer to be 6, but that seems too simple.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider that when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times each term in the second expansion. But that would mean the coefficient isn't a single number but a sum involving \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense. So, perhaps the problem is indeed asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, treating all variables together, so the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, giving 384.\n\nWait, but let's think about it differently. If I have two polynomials, P(a, b) and Q(c), then the product P(a, b) * Q(c) would have terms where each term in P is multiplied by each term in Q. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in P(a, b) times the sum of all coefficients in Q(c). So, that would be 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nYes, that makes sense because when you multiply P(a, b) by Q(c), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the same as in P(a, b) times the sum of coefficients in Q(c), since each term in Q(c) is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\).\n\nSo, I think the correct answer is 384.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it might be 120 if it's asking for \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). But the problem doesn't specify \\(c^0\\), so I think the correct interpretation is that it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), which would be 384.\n\nWait, but let me confirm by expanding both parts. The first part is \\((a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). The second part is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which expands to \\(c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15/c^2 + 6/c^4 + 1/c^6\\). Now, when I multiply these two, each term in the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part. So, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is \\(6 \\times (c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15/c^2 + 6/c^4 + 1/c^6)\\). So, the coefficient is 6 times that entire expression, which is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient, which is a number, so perhaps it's 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, giving 384.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), then it's 6 times 20, which is 120. But since the problem doesn't specify \\(c^0\\), I think it's 384.\n\nWait, but let me check the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 (c + 1/c)^6\\)\". It doesn't mention \\(c\\), so perhaps it's considering the entire expression as a polynomial in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is a sum of terms in \\(c\\). But that would mean the coefficient isn't a single number but a polynomial, which contradicts the problem's phrasing. Therefore, perhaps the problem is intended to ask for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, ignoring the second part, which would be 6. But that seems unlikely because the entire expression is given as a product.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is written incorrectly, and it's supposed to be \\((a + b)^4 (c + d)^6\\), but no, it's written as \\((c + 1/c)^6\\). So, I think the correct approach is that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 64, giving 384.\n\nWait, but to be thorough, let me compute the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). As I did before, substituting \\(c = 1\\) gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the sum of coefficients is 64. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 384.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it might be 120 if considering \\(c^0\\), but I think the problem is asking for the coefficient regardless of \\(c\\), so 384 is the correct answer.\n\nWait, let me think of it another way. If I have two polynomials, one in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the other in \\(c\\), then the product is a polynomial where each term is a product of terms from each polynomial. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial. That makes sense because each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by every term in the second polynomial. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nSo, after all this thinking, I believe the coefficient is 384.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break it down into two parts using the binomial theorem.\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\):**\n   The general term is \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\\).

But wait, the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I think I need to consider how this multiplication affects the coefficient. \n\nHmm, so the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by every term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I think the terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) don't affect the powers of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nWait, but that doesn't seem quite right. Let me think again. When you multiply two expressions together, each term from the first expression is multiplied by each term from the second expression. So, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) from \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). However, since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and the other expression involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), which are different variables, the coefficients from the \\(c\\) terms won't affect the power of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). \n\nWait, so does that mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is just 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)? That can't be, because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would be a constant, not an expression involving \\(c\\). Hmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again.\n\nIt says, \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are different variables, the terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) don't interfere with the powers of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is \\(6 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial in \\(c\\), not a constant. But the problem is asking for a coefficient, which should be a constant. So, maybe I'm missing something.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, in other words, when you multiply everything out, you'll have terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for various \\(k\\). The coefficient for each of these terms would be 6 times the coefficient from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But if the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then it would be the sum of all the coefficients from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each multiplied by 6. But that seems a bit odd because the coefficient would then be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\).\n\nWait, no, the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\( (1 + 1)^6 = 64 \\). So, if I set \\(c = 1\\), the entire expression becomes \\((a + b)^4 \\times 64\\). Then, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times 64, which is 384. But I'm not sure if that's what the problem is asking for because it's not clear whether it's asking for the coefficient regardless of \\(c\\) or just the coefficient when considering \\(a^2b^2\\) times any power of \\(c\\). \n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think again. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and the expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are different variables, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), so each of these terms will have a different power of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is actually \\(6 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), because each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is multiplied by \\(6a^2b^2\\). \n\nBut that seems to suggest that the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), but the problem is probably expecting a numerical coefficient. Hmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding the question. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where \\(c\\) is raised to the zero power, i.e., the constant term. That would make sense because then the coefficient would be a number.\n\nSo, if that's the case, I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). That way, the coefficient would be a constant, not involving \\(c\\).\n\nAlright, so let's approach it that way. So, first, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, as we saw earlier. Then, we need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), because when we multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), and we're interested in the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. \n\nSo, let's find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\times \\left(1/c\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\).\n\nWe need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be zero, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\).\n\nCalculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 20.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire expression is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake here. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\) with coefficient 6, and the term \\(c^0\\) comes from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) with coefficient 20. So, when you multiply them together, the coefficient becomes 6 * 20 = 120. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is 120.\n\nBut wait, the original problem didn't specify anything about \\(c\\), it just asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, maybe I was overcomplicating it by considering \\(c\\). Maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). That is, the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial in \\(c\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(6 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that seems unlikely because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, not a polynomial.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is considering \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) as separate variables and is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). In that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 2^6 = 6 * 64 = 384. Because the sum of coefficients is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\).\n\nWait, but that doesn't seem right because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would include all the terms multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), each with their own coefficient from the \\(c\\) terms. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial. So, the coefficient isn't a single number but a polynomial in \\(c\\).\n\nBut the problem is asking for \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", which suggests that it's expecting a numerical value. Therefore, perhaps I made a mistake earlier in interpreting the problem. Maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be 120, as I calculated earlier. Alternatively, maybe the problem is only considering the part of the expression that involves \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the rest is irrelevant, but that seems unlikely.\n\nWait, let me check the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, it's possible that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the powers of \\(c\\), meaning that the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial. But that seems odd because usually, when a problem asks for a coefficient, it's expecting a numerical value, not a polynomial.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. Let me think about that again.\n\nWhen you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) from \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which has terms like \\(c^6\\), \\(6c^4\\), \\(15c^2\\), \\(20\\), \\(15c^{-2}\\), \\(6c^{-4}\\), and \\(c^{-6}\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) would be 6 * 20 = 120, as I calculated earlier.\n\nBut the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), without specifying anything about \\(c\\). So, perhaps the problem is expecting the coefficient to be a polynomial in \\(c\\), which would be 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that seems complicated, and the problem is probably expecting a numerical answer.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think differently. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is just the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), meaning that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(6 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that can't be right because the problem is expecting a numerical coefficient.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. Alternatively, maybe it's a misstatement, and the problem is actually \\((a + b + c + 1/c)^4\\), but no, that's not what's given.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, considering all possible powers of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384. Because the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives 2^6 = 64.\n\nBut wait, that would mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 384, which is a numerical value. But I'm not sure if that's the correct approach because the problem is specifically asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not the coefficient when considering all powers of \\(c\\).\n\nWait, perhaps I should clarify. When you have a product of two expressions, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each expression. So, in this case, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\) with coefficient 6, and it's multiplied by every term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), meaning that the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), not a single number. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(6 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which expands to a polynomial.\n\nBut that seems unlikely because the problem is probably expecting a numerical coefficient. Therefore, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120, as I calculated earlier. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), which would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, let me think again. If I have two separate expressions, \\(P(a, b)\\) and \\(Q(c)\\), then the product \\(P(a, b) \\times Q(c)\\) will have terms where each term from \\(P\\) is multiplied by each term from \\(Q\\). So, the coefficient of a specific term in \\(P(a, b)\\) times \\(Q(c)\\) would be the coefficient from \\(P(a, b)\\) times each term in \\(Q(c)\\). So, for example, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^k\\) in \\(Q(c)\\). Therefore, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then it's 6 times the entire \\(Q(c)\\), which is \\(6 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that's a polynomial, not a number.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it's 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(Q(c)\\), which is 20, so 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nGiven that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and not specifying anything about \\(c\\), I think the intended answer is 120, assuming that it's asking for the coefficient when \\(c\\) is at the zero power. Alternatively, the problem might have a typo, and it's supposed to be \\((a + b + c)^4\\), but that's just a guess.\n\nWait, perhaps I should check the problem again. It says: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, the variables are separate, and the term \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), so the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial. But since the problem is asking for a coefficient, which is a number, perhaps it's intended to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without considering \\(c\\), which would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384. But I'm not sure about that because the sum of coefficients is found by setting all variables to 1, which gives 64, but in this case, \\(c\\) is involved in a reciprocal, so setting \\(c = 1\\) gives \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\), which is correct.\n\nWait, but if I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\), and then \\((a + b)^4 \\times 64\\) would have the term \\(6a^2b^2 \\times 64 = 384a^2b^2\\). So, in that case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 384.\n\nBut that approach seems a bit forced because the problem didn't specify setting \\(c = 1\\). So, I'm torn between two possibilities: either the coefficient is 120, considering only the constant term in \\(c\\), or 384, considering the sum of all coefficients in \\(c\\).\n\nWait, let me think differently. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and the expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are separate variables, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by every term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each of which has a different power of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is \\(6 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial. But the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, so perhaps it's expecting the coefficient when \\(c = 1\\), which would be 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is expecting the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nWait, perhaps I should check the problem again. It says: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, it's possible that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), meaning that the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial. But since the problem is asking for a coefficient, which is a number, perhaps the intended answer is 120, considering only the constant term in \\(c\\).\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable, so the coefficient would be a polynomial. But that seems unlikely because the problem is expecting a numerical answer.\n\nWait, let me try to think of it another way. If I have two separate polynomials multiplied together, the coefficient of a term in the product is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each polynomial. So, in this case, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\) with coefficient 6, and it's multiplied by every term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), meaning that the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which is \\(6 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\).\n\nBut that can't be right because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, not a polynomial. Therefore, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nWait, I think I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try to approach it methodically.\n\nFirst, find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\). That's 6.\n\nNext, consider the other factor, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). When you multiply the two expressions together, each term from \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which has terms of the form \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\\).\n\nTherefore, the product will have terms like \\(6 \\times \\dbinom{6}{k} a^2b^2c^{6 - 2k}\\) for \\(k = 0\\) to \\(6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^{m}\\) is \\(6 \\times \\dbinom{6}{k}\\) where \\(m = 6 - 2k\\).\n\nBut the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), without specifying the power of \\(c\\). So, perhaps the problem is asking for the sum of all coefficients of \\(a^2b^2c^m\\) for all \\(m\\), which would be \\(6 \\times \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k}\\). But \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} = 2^6 = 64\\), so the sum would be \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\nAlternatively, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it's \\(6 \\times \\dbinom{6}{3} = 6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nGiven that the problem didn't specify the power of \\(c\\), I think the intended answer is 120, assuming that it's asking for the constant term in \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is 120.\n\nBut to be thorough, let me check both interpretations.\n\n1. If the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), then it's 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\n2. If the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it's 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nGiven that the problem is presented as is, I think the more likely intended answer is 120, as it's a specific term, whereas 384 would be the sum over all terms, which seems less likely.\n\nTherefore, I think the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. To find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product, we also need the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20. Multiplying these gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{120}"

So, when I multiply the entire expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) by the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. \n\nBut since I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I should note that the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\). So, any term from the second expansion will just be a constant with respect to \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). That means that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression will just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nWait, no, that doesn't sound quite right. Let me think again. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product of the two expressions. So, when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficients multiply as well. But in this case, the second polynomial is in terms of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), which are separate variables from \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). So, the variables \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are only present in the first part of the product, \\((a + b)^4\\). \n\nThat means that when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the resulting expression will have terms that are products of the terms from each expansion. However, since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are only in the first part, the variables in each term of the product will be either \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) or \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), but not a mix of both. \n\nWait, but the problem is asking specifically for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, in the entire product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by every term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nBut that seems like it would give me a sum involving \\(c\\) terms, but the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not any specific term involving \\(c\\). Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Maybe the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, in other words, when you multiply the two expressions, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all terms in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nWait, but that doesn't make much sense because the sum of all terms in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is a number, but the coefficient would then be a number multiplied by 6. But perhaps I'm misinterpreting the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" \n\nSo, maybe the problem is considering the entire product as a single expression, and it's asking for the coefficient of the term \\(a^2b^2\\) times any power of \\(c\\). But in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which would be a polynomial in \\(c\\). But that seems unlikely because the problem is probably expecting a numerical coefficient. \n\nWait, perhaps the problem is intended to be treated as a single expression, and the variables \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are all independent. So, when it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), it's considering the coefficient regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). But that's a bit ambiguous. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to have only \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) in the term, and \\(c\\) terms would be considered as part of the coefficient. \n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think differently. Since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and the expression is \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), perhaps the coefficient is just the product of the coefficients of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and the entire second part. But that doesn't sound right because the second part is a sum of terms involving \\(c\\), so the coefficient would be a sum of terms, not a single number. \n\nWait, maybe I'm supposed to treat \\(c\\) as a variable and find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which would be a polynomial in \\(c\\). But that seems complicated, and I don't think that's what the problem is asking. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), meaning the constant term in \\(c\\). That is, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). That might make sense because then we're looking for a specific term in the product. Let me check that possibility. \n\nIf that's the case, then I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and multiply it by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). That would give me the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is the term \\(a^2b^2\\). \n\nSo, let's proceed with that approach. First, as I calculated earlier, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. Now, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). \n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), I can again use the binomial theorem. Expanding \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(1/c\\right)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). \n\nI need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be 0, so I set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), I get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). \n\nThe coefficient when \\(k = 3\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 20. \n\nNow, since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), we multiply the coefficients from each part. That is, 6 (from \\(a^2b^2\\)) multiplied by 20 (from \\(c^0\\)), which gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). \n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is 120. \n\nWait, but let me double-check that. I think I might have made a mistake in interpreting the problem. The original problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", not specifying anything about \\(c\\). So, perhaps the problem is considering the entire product, and the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any power of \\(c\\), so the coefficient would be the sum of all the coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by 6. \n\nBut that would mean the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). The sum of all coefficients in a polynomial is found by setting all variables to 1. So, setting \\(c = 1\\), we get \\(\\left(1 + 1/1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of all coefficients in the second part is 64. \n\nTherefore, if I multiply that by 6, I get \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). But that would mean the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 384, regardless of the power of \\(c\\). But that seems too large, and I'm not sure if that's what the problem is asking. \n\nWait, but the problem is phrased as \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", without mentioning \\(c\\). So, in the product, \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by every possible term from the second expansion. So, the coefficient would indeed be the sum of all those products, which is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 times 64, which is 384. \n\nBut earlier, I thought that the problem might be asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be 120. So, which interpretation is correct? \n\nLooking back at the problem statement: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" It doesn't specify anything about \\(c\\), so perhaps it's expecting the coefficient regardless of the power of \\(c\\). That is, the coefficient would be the sum over all \\(c\\) terms. So, in that case, it's 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 times 64, which is 384. \n\nWait, but that seems a bit counterintuitive because in the product, each term would be \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by some power of \\(c\\), so the coefficient would vary depending on the power of \\(c\\). But the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not considering \\(c\\). So, perhaps the problem is intended to have \\(c\\) terms considered as part of the coefficient, meaning that the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\). \n\nWait, but that's not how coefficients usually work. Coefficients are typically constants with respect to the variables. So, if the term is \\(a^2b^2\\), the coefficient would be a number, not involving \\(c\\). Therefore, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), that is, the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\). \n\nGiven that, then the coefficient would be 6 times 20, which is 120, as I calculated earlier. \n\nWait, but let me check again. If I consider the entire product, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by every term in the second part. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). \n\nBut that would mean that the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a coefficient, which should be a number. Therefore, I think the correct interpretation is that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\). \n\nSo, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 (from \\(a^2b^2\\)) multiplied by 20 (from \\(c^0\\)), which is 120. \n\nWait, but let me think again. If I expand the entire product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will appear multiplied by each term from the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the entire second expansion. But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. \n\nTherefore, perhaps the problem is intended to have \\(c\\) terms considered as separate variables, and the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just 6, ignoring the \\(c\\) part. But that seems unlikely because the problem includes the second part in the product. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, meaning that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 times 64, which is 384. \n\nWait, but that would mean that the coefficient is 384, which is a large number. I'm not sure if that's correct. \n\nWait, let me think differently. When you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in one polynomial is multiplied by all terms in the other polynomial. So, in this case, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by every term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial in \\(c\\). \n\nBut since the problem is asking for the coefficient, which is a number, perhaps it's considering only the constant term in \\(c\\), i.e., the coefficient of \\(c^0\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times 20, which is 120. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to have \\(c\\) terms considered as part of the coefficient, but that doesn't make much sense because coefficients are typically constants. \n\nWait, maybe I should look at the problem again. It says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)\". So, in the entire product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by terms involving \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually be a polynomial in \\(c\\), but the problem is asking for the coefficient, which is a number, so perhaps it's only considering the constant term, i.e., the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). \n\nTherefore, I think the correct approach is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product, which is 6 times 20, which is 120. \n\nWait, but let me confirm this. If I expand the product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\), and it's multiplied by each term from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is indeed 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial. But since the problem is asking for the coefficient, perhaps it's only interested in the term where the power of \\(c\\) is zero, making the coefficient a constant. \n\nTherefore, I think the answer is 120. \n\nWait, but let me just calculate it again to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. \n\nFirst, \\((a + b)^4\\): the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). \n\nThen, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\): the term where \\(c^0\\) is when the exponent is zero, which happens when \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), so \\(k = 3\\). The coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). \n\nMultiplying these together: \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). \n\nYes, that seems correct. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 120. \n\nWait, but I'm still a bit confused because if I don't consider the \\(c\\) terms, the coefficient would just be 6, but that seems too simple. On the other hand, if I consider the entire product, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which is 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient, which should be a number, so I think the correct interpretation is that it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting the sum of all coefficients for \\(a^2b^2\\), which would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 times 64, which is 384. But that seems too large, and I don't think that's what's intended. \n\nWait, let me think differently. If I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the entire expression becomes \\((a + b)^4 \\times 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in this case would be 6 times 64, which is 384. \n\nBut that would mean that the coefficient depends on the value of \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because coefficients are independent of variable values. So, perhaps that approach is incorrect. \n\nWait, no, when you set \\(c = 1\\), you're evaluating the entire expression at \\(c = 1\\), which gives you a specific value, but the coefficient itself is a number that doesn't depend on \\(c\\). \n\nWait, maybe I'm confusing the concept. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is a polynomial in \\(c\\), meaning that it's a sum of terms involving different powers of \\(c\\). But if the problem is asking for the coefficient, it's probably expecting a numerical value, which suggests that it's looking for the coefficient when \\(c\\) is also considered. \n\nWait, perhaps the problem is intended to have \\(c\\) as a variable, and the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\), so the coefficient is 120. Alternatively, if the problem is considering the entire product, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would indeed be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but that's a polynomial, not a single number. \n\nGiven that the problem is asking for the coefficient, which is a number, I think the correct interpretation is that it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. \n\nSo, after all that, I think the answer is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is found by first determining the coefficient in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplying it by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20. Thus, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}."

Calculating the coefficients, that would be \\(1a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + 1b^4\\). Okay, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) here is 6. \n\nBut wait, the problem isn't just \\((a + b)^4\\); it's multiplied by another expression, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I think I need to consider the entire product. But I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Hmm, so does that mean I can ignore the other terms in the second expression? Or do I need to consider how the multiplication affects the coefficients? Let me think.\n\nSince I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which comes from the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), and then the second part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, actually, when I multiply these two expressions together, each term in the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But since I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\), maybe the coefficients from the second expression will just multiply the coefficients from the first part. So, perhaps I can find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and then multiply it by the entire expansion of the second part, but since I'm only interested in the coefficient, maybe I can just take the coefficient from the first part and multiply it by the sum of the coefficients in the second part? Wait, no, that might not be right. Let me clarify.\n\nWait, actually, no. Because when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first polynomial gets multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by every term in the second part, which is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is a constant with respect to \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. But that doesn't make sense because the second part is a polynomial in \\(c\\), so when you multiply, \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, leading to terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2c^{-k}\\). So, actually, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) itself, without any \\(c\\) terms, would only come from multiplying \\(a^2b^2\\) by the constant term in the second expansion. Because if you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by \\(c^k\\) or \\(c^{-k}\\), you won't get a term that's just \\(a^2b^2\\). So, to get \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, you need to multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part by the constant term (the term with \\(c^0\\)) from the second part. \n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is equal to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, first, I found that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. Now, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nAlright, let's tackle that. So, I need to expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) and find the constant term, which is the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0. Again, I can use the binomial theorem here. The binomial expansion is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k\\). Simplifying each term, that becomes \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} c^{-k} = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\).\n\nSo, each term has an exponent of \\(6 - 2k\\). I need the term where the exponent is 0, so I set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), that gives \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is the term when \\(k = 3\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} c^{0}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20.\n\nNow, going back to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the two coefficients I found. That is, 6 (from \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\)) multiplied by 20 (from the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)). So, 6 times 20 is 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 120.\n\nWait a second, let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes here. So, I used the binomial theorem on both expressions, found the coefficients for \\(a^2b^2\\) and \\(c^0\\) respectively, then multiplied them together. That makes sense because when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficients multiply for the corresponding terms. Since \\(a^2b^2\\) and \\(c^0\\) are independent terms, their coefficients multiply to give the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is just \\(a^2b^2\\). So, yeah, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, another way to think about it is that the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Since multiplication is commutative and associative, the terms from each expansion multiply independently. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part is 20, so when you multiply these two, you get 120, which is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product. \n\nI think that makes sense. Let me just double-check my calculations. For \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). For \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the constant term occurs when the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, which happens when \\(k = 3\\), and \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, 6 * 20 = 120. Yep, that seems correct. \n\nI don't think I made any mistakes here. So, the final answer should be 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem on each part separately.\n\nFirst, we expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n\\]\nThe term containing \\(a^2b^2\\) is:\n\\[\n\\dbinom{4}{2} a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\n\\]\nSo, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\nNext, we expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem:\n\\[\n\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n\\]\nWe need the constant term (where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0).

The constant term is:\n\\[\n\\dbinom{6}{3} c^0 = 20\n\\]\nSo, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20.\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the product of the coefficients from each part:\n\\[\n6 \\times 20 = 120\n\\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

Calculating the coefficients, that's \\(1 \\cdot a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + 1b^4\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in this part is 6. \n\nBut wait, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I need to consider the entire product. Now, I think that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be the same as the coefficient in \\((a + b)^4\\) because when you multiply by the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), it doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\). So, maybe the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the product would just be the same as in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by whatever term from the second part that doesn't affect \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). \n\nBut hold on, is that correct? Let me think again. When I multiply two expressions, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression. So, if I'm looking for a term that has \\(a^2b^2\\), I need to make sure that when I multiply a term from \\((a + b)^4\\) by a term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the resulting term doesn't introduce any \\(a\\) or \\(b\\) factors. That means the term from the second expression should be a constant, right? Because if it's a constant, multiplying by \\(a^2b^2\\) would just give \\(a^2b^2\\) times that constant, so the coefficient would be 6 times that constant. \n\nWait, but \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is another binomial expansion. Let me expand that as well to see if there's a constant term. Using the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). \n\nSo, the general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). Now, I need to find the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero because that would be the constant term. So, set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which gives \\(m = 3\\). So, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} c^{0} = 20\\). \n\nTherefore, the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. So, when I multiply the two expressions together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by this constant term 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the second part), which is 120. \n\nWait, let me check if that makes sense. If I have \\((a + b)^4\\) which has \\(a^2b^2\\) with coefficient 6, and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) which has a constant term 20, then when I multiply them, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will be 6 * 20 * \\(a^2b^2\\), so yes, the coefficient is 120. \n\nIs there any other term that could contribute to \\(a^2b^2\\)? Let me think. If the second part had terms with \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), then maybe, but since it only has \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), which are different variables, they don't interfere with \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). So, the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is by taking the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part and multiplying it by the constant term from the second part. \n\nSo, I think my reasoning is correct. The coefficient should be 6 * 20 = 120. Let me just recap: \n\n1. Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is 6.\n2. Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem to find the constant term, which is 20.\n3. Multiply these two coefficients together because the terms are multiplied in the product, resulting in 120.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem.\n\n1. Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term containing \\(a^2b^2\\) is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\n   \\]\n   So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6.\n\n2.

Calculating the coefficients, that's \\(1a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + 1b^4\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in this part is 6. \n\nBut wait, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). That means I also need to consider the second part, which is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Since the variables in the second part are c and 1/c, they don't affect the a and b terms. So, maybe I can treat the two parts separately and then multiply the coefficients? Let me think.\n\nYes, because when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first polynomial gets multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. But since the second polynomial only has c terms, and the first has a and b, the a and b terms won't be affected by the c terms. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, no, that doesn't sound right. Because actually, when you multiply the two expressions, each term from \\((a + b)^4\\) gets multiplied by each term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve c, the terms involving c won't affect the a and b terms. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, is that correct?\n\nLet me clarify. When you have a product of two expressions, say P(a, b) * Q(c), then the coefficient of a term like a^2b^2 in the product is equal to the coefficient of a^2b^2 in P(a, b) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in Q(c). Because every term in Q(c) will multiply the a^2b^2 term from P(a, b). So, in this case, the coefficient we're looking for is 6 (from \\((a + b)^4\\)) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nNow, I need to find the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The sum of coefficients in a polynomial is found by plugging in 1 for all variables. So, if I substitute c = 1 into \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), I should get the sum of all coefficients. Let's compute that.\n\nSubstituting c = 1, we get \\(\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = (1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait a second, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake here. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6, and the sum of coefficients in the second part is 64, so multiplying them gives 384. That seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, I can think about it as the total expression being a product of two independent expansions, so the coefficients multiply when taking the product. So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) times any term in the second expansion would just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times the entire second expansion's coefficients summed up, because each term in the second expansion is multiplied by the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. So, yes, 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nLet me double-check my calculations. For \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). For \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), when c = 1, it becomes 2^6 = 64, which is correct. So, 6 * 64 is 384. I think that's right.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can approach it another way to confirm. Let's consider that the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). If I expand both parts separately, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term comes only from the first part, and the second part's expansion will contribute a factor that doesn't involve a or b. So, when I multiply them, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) will be 6 times the entire expansion of the second part, but since we're just looking for the coefficient, it's 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second part, which is 64. So, 6 * 64 = 384. Yep, that checks out.\n\nI don't think I made any mistakes here. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression is found by first determining the coefficient in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplying it by the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 64. Thus, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n\\boxed{384}"

That means I need \\(4 - k = 2\\) for \\(a\\) and \\(k = 2\\) for \\(b\\). Solving \\(4 - k = 2\\) gives \\(k = 2\\). So, the term I'm interested in is when \\(k = 2\\). \n\nCalculating that term, it's \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} a^{2}b^{2}\\). The binomial coefficient \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) is calculated as \\(\\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6. \n\nNow, the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).

But hold on, no, that doesn't sound right. \n\nWait, actually, I think I might have made a mistake. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, when we expand this, each term from the first expansion is multiplied by each term from the second expansion. But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\), we need to consider how this term interacts with the second part. \n\nWait, no, actually, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is independent of \\(c\\), so when we multiply it by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product will be the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all the coefficients from the second part. But that can't be right because the second part is multiplied as a whole. Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. \n\nWait, perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, in the product, \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term from the second expansion. But since the problem doesn't specify any condition on \\(c\\), maybe we just need the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times the sum of all coefficients from the second part. But that seems off because the coefficients from the second part would vary depending on the power of \\(c\\). \n\nWait, no, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Maybe the question is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, considering all terms, but without any specific condition on \\(c\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by each term from the second part, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times each term in the second expansion. But since the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, it would be the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. But that doesn't make sense because that would give a polynomial in \\(c\\), and the coefficient would be a polynomial, not a single number. \n\nWait, perhaps I'm misinterpreting. Maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some \\(k\\), but it's not specified. Wait, no, the problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", without mentioning \\(c\\). So, in the product, each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by each term from the second part, which would be of the form \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(1/c\\right)^m = \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). \n\nSo, when we multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be the coefficient from the first part times each term from the second part. But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, it's actually the sum of all the coefficients from the second part multiplied by the coefficient from the first part. Wait, no, that's not quite right. \n\nWait, actually, in the entire expansion, each term is a product of a term from the first expansion and a term from the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by each term from the second part, which would give terms like \\(6a^2b^2 \\times \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion would be \\(6 \\times \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\), but since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), we can't sum them because each term has a different power of \\(c\\). \n\nWait, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times any power of \\(c\\), so the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of the second part. But that seems odd because the coefficient would then be a polynomial in \\(c\\). Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only considering the terms where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out, i.e., where \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), so \\(m = 3\\). That would make the term \\(c^0 = 1\\), so the coefficient would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion. \n\nWait, that makes sense. Maybe the problem is implicitly asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be the term where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out. So, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), and then multiply it by the coefficient from the first part, which is 6. \n\nLet me check that. So, in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\times (1/c)^m = \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We want the exponent of \\(c\\) to be 0, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which gives \\(m = 3\\). So, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. \n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire expression is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120. \n\nWait, but I'm not sure if the problem is asking for the coefficient regardless of \\(c\\). If it's just asking for \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), then the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of the second part, which is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a single coefficient. Therefore, it's more likely that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the constant term with respect to \\(c\\). \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, without considering \\(c\\). But that would imply that the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which is unusual. So, I think the intended interpretation is that we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by the constant term in the second expansion. \n\nTherefore, the coefficient is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the second part), giving 120. \n\nWait, let me double-check that. \n\nFirst, expand \\((a + b)^4\\): the term \\(a^2b^2\\) has coefficient \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). \n\nThen, expand \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\): the term with \\(c^0\\) is when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), so \\(m = 3\\). The coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). \n\nMultiply these two coefficients: \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). \n\nSo, yes, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is 120. Therefore, the answer is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is found by considering the expansion of each part. Using the binomial theorem, the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The constant term (with respect to \\(c\\)) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Multiplying these gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n$\\boxed{120}$"

Let me clarify: when you multiply two expressions together, each term in the first expression multiplies each term in the second expression. But since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are different variables from \\(c\\), the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) will only multiply the constants or terms from the second expression that don't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\). However, in this case, the second expression only involves \\(c\\), so the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) will just be multiplied by the entire second expression. \n\nWait, but that can't be right because the second expression is also being expanded. Let me think again. Let me denote the first part as \\(P = (a + b)^4\\) and the second part as \\(Q = \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the product is \\(P \\times Q\\). Now, \\(P\\) has terms like \\(a^4\\), \\(a^3b\\), \\(a^2b^2\\), etc., and \\(Q\\) has terms like \\(c^6\\), \\(c^5 \\cdot (1/c)\\), \\(c^4 \\cdot (1/c)^2\\), etc. \n\nBut when I multiply \\(P\\) and \\(Q\\), each term in \\(P\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(Q\\).

So, in the product \\(P \\times Q\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by every term in \\(Q\\). \n\nWait, but that would mean that \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(Q\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would actually be \\(6 \\times\\) the sum of all coefficients in \\(Q\\).

So, each of these would create a term like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), etc. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would imply that we're looking for the term where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out, i.e., \\(c^0\\). \n\nWait, that makes sense. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) because \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms is the same as \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). So, to find this, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(Q = \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) and then multiply it by the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(P\\), which is 6. \n\nSo, let's compute the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(Q\\). The expression \\(Q = \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) can be expanded using the binomial theorem as well. The general term in the expansion is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(1/c\\right)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be 0, so we set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). \n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(Q\\) is 20. \n\nNow, going back to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product \\(P \\times Q\\) is the product of the coefficients from \\(P\\) and \\(Q\\). That is, 6 (from \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(P\\)) multiplied by 20 (from \\(c^0\\) in \\(Q\\)). So, 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nWait, so does that mean the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120? Let me double-check. \n\nFirst, in \\(P = (a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6. In \\(Q = \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. When we multiply \\(P\\) and \\(Q\\), each term in \\(P\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(Q\\), so the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from \\(P\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(Q\\), including the constant term \\(c^0\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nBut wait, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). However, in the product \\(P \\times Q\\), any term involving \\(a^2b^2\\) will have some power of \\(c\\) attached to it, unless the \\(c\\) terms cancel out. So, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, then we might need to sum over all possible \\(c\\) exponents. But that doesn't make sense because \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term without \\(c\\), so it's only present when multiplied by the constant term in \\(Q\\). \n\nWait, I think the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, which would include all possible powers of \\(c\\). But that can't be right because \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term without \\(c\\), so it's only present once in the product when multiplied by the constant term of \\(Q\\). Therefore, the coefficient is indeed 120. \n\nLet me think again to make sure I'm not missing anything. So, in \\(P\\), \\(a^2b^2\\) has a coefficient of 6. In \\(Q\\), the constant term has a coefficient of 20. So, when multiplied together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from \\(P\\) times the constant term from \\(Q\\) gives \\(6 \\times 20 \\times a^2b^2c^0\\). Since there are no other terms in \\(Q\\) that don't involve \\(c\\), this is the only term with \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient is 120. \n\nI think that's correct. Let me just recap: \n\n1. Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is 6.\n2. Expand \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem and find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\), which is 20.\n3. Multiply these two coefficients together because the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion is multiplied by the constant term in the second expansion to give the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product.\n4. The result is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nYes, that makes sense. I don't think I made any mistakes here. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6. Next, we find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20. Multiplying these gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\boxed{120}."

Calculating the coefficients, that would be \\(1a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + 1b^4\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in this part is 6. \n\nWait, but the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, which is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Hmm, so I think I need to consider how the two parts multiply together. But since the second part involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), and the first part involves \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), maybe the \\(c\\) terms don't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms when multiplying. So, perhaps the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, no, that doesn't seem right because when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first polynomial gets multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. But since the first part only has \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms and the second part only has \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) terms, the multiplication would result in terms that have both \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) parts and \\(c\\) parts. But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\) at all. So, does that mean that the \\(c\\) terms don't affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)? Because when you multiply, any term in the second polynomial would have a \\(c\\) term, so the product would have terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2 \\times 1/c^k\\). But the problem is only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would imply that the \\(c\\) terms have to cancel out, i.e., \\(c^0\\). So, maybe I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) and then multiply it by the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6. \n\nWait, that makes sense. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Let me think about how to do that. Again, using the binomial theorem, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\times (1/c)^k\\). Simplifying that, each term would be \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, I need to find the value of \\(k\\) for which the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, because that's when \\(c^0\\), which is 1. So, setting \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\), which is 20. \n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the second part), which is 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nWait, but let me double-check that. So, the first part gives me 6 for \\(a^2b^2\\), and the second part gives me 20 for \\(c^0\\). When I multiply the two polynomials, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second part, but only the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0 will contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), because otherwise, you'd have \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2 \\times 1/c^k\\), which aren't just \\(a^2b^2\\). So, only the term where \\(k=3\\) in the second part, which is 20, will multiply with the 6 from the first part to give 120. \n\nLet me think if there's another way to approach this. Alternatively, maybe I can consider that since the two parts are multiplied together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just the product of the coefficients of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and the constant term in the second part. That seems to align with what I did earlier. So, 6 times 20 is 120. \n\nIs there a chance I made a mistake in calculating the binomial coefficients? Let me check. For \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\), which is 6. That's correct. For \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term where \\(c^0\\) occurs is when \\(k=3\\), so \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). That's also correct. So, 6 times 20 is indeed 120. \n\nWait, another thought: when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, if I have \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first polynomial and, say, \\(c^3\\) from the second, that would give me \\(a^2b^2c^3\\). But the problem is only asking for \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term without any \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\). So, the only way that happens is if the \\(c\\) terms multiply to 1, i.e., \\(c^0\\). So, yes, only the term where the second part contributes a \\(c^0\\) term will result in a term that's just \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient is indeed 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nI think that's solid. So, the coefficient is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is found using the binomial theorem, which gives 6. The coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by solving \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), yielding \\(k=3\\) and the coefficient \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying these gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\boxed{120}"

So, I think I need to consider both parts of the product. Since I'm only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I might not need to worry about the \\(c\\) terms, right?

Because \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) expands into terms involving various powers of \\(c\\), but since \\(a^2b^2\\) is independent of \\(c\\), perhaps the only way \\(a^2b^2\\) can appear in the product is if we multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part by the constant term (i.e., \\(c^0\\)) from the second part. So, maybe I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) and then multiply it by the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part. \n\nYes, that makes sense.

Again, using the binomial theorem, the expansion is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k\\). Simplifying each term, that becomes \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). \n\nSo, the general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). I need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero because that's the constant term. So, set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(6 = 2k\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} c^{0} = \\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20. \n\nNow, going back to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, as I found earlier. So, when I multiply the two expressions together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by the constant term 20 from the second part.

That means I need to find the term where \\(a\\) is squared and \\(b\\) is squared in the first part, and then multiply it by whatever comes from the second part, right? But actually, since the two parts are multiplied together, maybe the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).

Let me think again.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, in other words, when you multiply out the entire expression, you'll have terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for different values of \\(k\\), but the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the sum of all the coefficients from the second part multiplied by 6. But I'm not sure if that's correct. Let me try to clarify.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating \\(c\\) as another variable. So, when you expand \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) separately, and then multiply them together, each term in the first expansion will multiply each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part will be multiplied by every term in the second part. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), not a single number. So, perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) independent of \\(c\\), meaning we need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) and then multiply it by 6.\n\nWait, that makes more sense. Because if we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is 6, multiplied by the constant term in the second expansion, which is the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. So, let me check that.\n\nFirst, I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, the exponent on \\(c\\) is \\(6 - 2k\\). We want the term where the exponent is zero, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\), which is 20.\n\nSo, the constant term in the second expansion is 20. Therefore, when we multiply the two expansions together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (the constant term from the second part), which is 120. \n\nWait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake here. So, the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), has a term \\(6a^2b^2\\). The second part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), has a term \\(20c^0 = 20\\). When you multiply these together, you get \\(6a^2b^2 \\times 20 = 120a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 120. \n\nBut wait, let me think again. If I'm just asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), does that mean I'm supposed to consider all possible terms in the entire expansion, including those with \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\)? Or is the problem only considering the terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by a constant term? Because if it's the former, then the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which would include terms with different powers of \\(c\\). But I think the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), but that doesn't make much sense because \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by various powers of \\(c\\). Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), which would be the constant term. \n\nWait, maybe I should check the problem statement again. It says, \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, it's not specifying anything about \\(c\\), so perhaps it's considering the entire expansion, and the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which seems unlikely because the problem is asking for a coefficient, which is usually a number. So, perhaps I was correct earlier, and the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when considering only the constant term in \\(c\\), which would be 120.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and not considering the second part. But that doesn't seem right because the entire expression is the product of both parts. So, I think the correct approach is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and then multiply it by the constant term in the second part, which is 20, giving 120. \n\nWait, but let me think about this again. When you multiply two expressions, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part, which includes terms like \\(c^6\\), \\(6c^4\\), \\(15c^2\\), \\(20\\), \\(15/c^2\\), \\(6/c^4\\), and \\(1/c^6\\). So, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by each of these, resulting in terms like \\(6a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(36a^2b^2c^4\\), etc., down to \\(120a^2b^2\\). So, in the entire expansion, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would include all these terms, but if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), that would be the sum of all these coefficients, which is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion. But the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), so \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient would be 6 * 64 = 384. But that seems too large, and I'm not sure if that's what the problem is asking for.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when considering the entire product, meaning the term \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by the constant term in the second expansion. So, that would be 6 * 20 = 120, as I thought earlier. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by the constant term in the second expansion. So, that would indeed be 120. \n\nI think that's the correct approach. So, to summarize: \n\n1. Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is 6.\n2. Expand \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem to find the constant term (where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero), which is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n3. Multiply these two coefficients together to get 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me verify each step again. \n\nFirst, \\((a + b)^4\\): the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). That's correct.\n\nNext, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\): using the binomial theorem, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - k}(1/c)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\\). We set the exponent to zero: \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), so \\(k = 3\\). The coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Correct.\n\nSo, when we multiply the two expansions, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by the constant term 20 from the second part, giving \\(6 * 20 = 120\\) as the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\). \n\nI think that's solid. So, the final answer should be 120.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term containing \\(a^2b^2\\) occurs when \\(k = 2\\):\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\n   \\]\n   So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in this part is 6.\n\n2. **Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n   \\]\n   We are interested in the constant term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero:\n   \\[\n   6 - 2k = 0 \\implies k = 3\n   \\]\n   The constant term is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\n   \\]\n\n3. **Combine the results:**\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficients from each part:\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 20 = 120\n   \\]\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

Calculating the coefficients, \\(\\dbinom{4}{0} = 1\\), \\(\\dbinom{4}{1} = 4\\), \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\), \\(\\dbinom{4}{3} = 4\\), and \\(\\dbinom{4}{4} = 1\\). So, the expansion becomes \\(a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\).\n\nNow, I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Looking at the expansion, the term with \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(6a^2b^2\\), so the coefficient is 6. But wait, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I think I need to consider the other part too, which is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nHmm, but how does that affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)? I'm supposed to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product of these two expansions. But since \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) are separate variables, they don't interact with \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). So, when I multiply the two expressions together, the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) will be multiplied by terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), but the coefficients for \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all terms from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), right?\n\nWait, no, that's not quite right. Actually, when you multiply two polynomials, each term from the first polynomial is multiplied by each term from the second polynomial. But since I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I don't need to consider how the \\(c\\) terms combine. Because \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), so when I multiply \\(6a^2b^2\\) by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be \\(6\\) times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nWait, but that can't be right because the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) would be when \\(c = 1\\), so substituting \\(c = 1\\) gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, would the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) be \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\)? Hmm, but that seems high. Let me think again.\n\nWait, no, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Because when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term from \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\). So, the coefficient would indeed be \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\nWait, but let me confirm that. Let me think of it another way. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6a\u00b2b\u00b2. Then, when we multiply by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in that expansion is multiplied by 6a\u00b2b\u00b2. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Since each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) has a coefficient, and when you sum them all up, that's equivalent to evaluating the expression at \\(c = 1\\), which is \\(2^6 = 64\\). So, yes, 6 times 64 is 384.\n\nWait, but another thought: does the problem ask for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the powers of \\(c\\)? Because if so, then yes, it's 6 times 64. But if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some specific \\(k\\), then it would be different. But as the problem is stated, it just asks for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so I think it's okay to include all the terms from the \\(c\\) part.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can approach it by considering that when you multiply the two expansions, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\). So, the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, so 6*64=384.\n\nWait, but let me check again. Alternatively, maybe I can think of it as the product of two polynomials. The first polynomial is in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the second is in \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, when you multiply them, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first polynomial with coefficient 6, and it's multiplied by every term in the second polynomial, each of which has its own coefficient. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, then the total coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial.\n\nBut wait, the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is indeed when \\(c = 1\\), which is \\(2^6 = 64\\). So, yes, 6 * 64 = 384. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 384.\n\nWait, but let me check another way. Maybe I can expand both expressions separately and then see the coefficient.\n\nFirst, as I did before, \\((a + b)^4\\) gives \\(a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\).\n\nNow, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) can be expanded using the binomial theorem as well. The expansion would be \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\).\n\nSo, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\) for \\(k = 0\\) to \\(6\\). The coefficients are \\(\\dbinom{6}{0} = 1\\), \\(\\dbinom{6}{1} = 6\\), \\(\\dbinom{6}{2} = 15\\), \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\), \\(\\dbinom{6}{4} = 15\\), \\(\\dbinom{6}{5} = 6\\), \\(\\dbinom{6}{6} = 1\\). So, the expansion is \\(c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15c^{-2} + 6c^{-4} + c^{-6}\\).\n\nNow, when I multiply the two polynomials \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be \\(6\\) (the coefficient from the first expansion) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion, because each term in the second expansion has a coefficient that, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), contributes to the overall coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\).\n\nSo, sum of coefficients in the second expansion is \\(1 + 6 + 15 + 20 + 15 + 6 + 1 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\nWait, but just to be thorough, let me think again. When you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term is the sum of the products of the coefficients of terms whose variables multiply to give that specific term. But in this case, since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), any term from the second polynomial will multiply \\(a^2b^2\\), and since \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) are separate variables, each term in the second polynomial will contribute its coefficient times the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first polynomial. So, yes, the total coefficient is indeed 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial.\n\nAlternatively, if I were to write out the product, it would be \\( (a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 \\), and when I expand it, each term from \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, each contributing a coefficient. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is \\(6 \\times (1 + 6 + 15 + 20 + 15 + 6 + 1)\\), which is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not missing anything. Is there a possibility that \\(a^2b^2\\) could come from other terms when multiplied by \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\)? For example, if there were terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), but since the problem just asks for \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), each multiplication of \\(a^2b^2\\) with any term from the second expansion would contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. Therefore, yes, the total coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, giving 384.\n\nSo, after going through this step by step, I think the coefficient is 384.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{384}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem.\n\nFirst, we expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n\\]\nThe term involving \\(a^2b^2\\) is:\n\\[\n\\dbinom{4}{2} a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\n\\]\nSo, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) from \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\nNext, we consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem:\n\\[\n\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n\\]\nThe coefficients of the terms in this expansion are:\n\\[\n1, 6, 15, 20, 15, 6, 1\n\\]\nThe sum of these coefficients is:\n\\[\n1 + 6 + 15 + 20 + 15 + 6 + 1 = 64\n\\]\n\nWhen we multiply the two polynomials \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the product of the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) and the sum of all coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient is:\n\\[\n6 \\times 64 = 384\n\\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{384}."

I'm specifically looking for the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2. That would be when \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). So, substituting \\(k = 2\\), the coefficient would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Let me compute that: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6.\n\nBut wait, the problem isn't just \\((a + b)^4\\); it's multiplied by another expression, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Hmm, does this mean I need to consider the expansion of both parts together? I think so. Because when you multiply two expressions, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), right?\n\nWait, no, that doesn't make sense. Because \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the variables are independent. That means the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from the terms involving \\(c\\). So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but wait, that's not quite right because the variables are different.\n\nWait, hold on. Let me think again. If I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), then in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms are separate from the \\(c\\) terms. So, when I multiply, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will be multiplied by every term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\), does that mean I just need to consider the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) and then multiply it by the entire expansion of the second part? Or is it that the coefficient is the product of the coefficients of each part?\n\nWait, no, I think that's not correct. Because in the product, each term from \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by every term from the second part. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part, which would be a sum of terms involving \\(c\\). But since the question is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), does that mean I just need to take the coefficient from the first part and multiply it by the sum of all coefficients from the second part?\n\nWait, that seems off. Let me try to clarify. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When expanded, each term will be of the form \\(\\text{something with } a \\text{ and } b \\times \\text{something with } c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient from the first part (\\(6\\)) multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. But that doesn't make sense because the expansion of the second part is a polynomial in \\(c\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually be a polynomial in \\(c\\), not just a number. But the problem is asking for the coefficient, implying a numerical coefficient. So, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, that would mean that the coefficient is the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part, but since the variables are separate, the coefficient would be the product of the two coefficients. Wait, no, that's not correct either. Let me think again.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), that is, the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\). Because otherwise, the coefficient would involve \\(c\\) terms, which isn't a number. So, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), meaning the constant term with respect to \\(c\\). So, I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nThat makes more sense. So, first, I find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, as I found earlier. Then, I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Once I have that, I can multiply the two coefficients together to get the final coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times the constant term in \\(c\\).\n\nSo, let's work on finding the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k\\). Simplifying the exponents, that becomes \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} c^{-k} = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\).\n\nWe want the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, so we set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\).\n\nSo, the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Now, going back to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the constant term in the second part is 20. Since these two parts are multiplied together, the overall coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times the constant term in \\(c\\) is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm interpreting the problem correctly. The question is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are different variables, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually be a polynomial in \\(c\\), unless we're considering only the constant term with respect to \\(c\\). But the problem doesn't specify, so maybe I need to consider all possible terms involving \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). But that would mean the coefficient is not a single number but a polynomial. Hmm, that seems unlikely because the problem is asking for \"the coefficient,\" which is usually a single number.\n\nTherefore, I think the intended interpretation is that we are looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), that is, the constant term in \\(c\\) multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). So, that would be 6 times 20, which is 120.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which would result in a polynomial. But since the question is asking for \"the coefficient,\" it's more likely that it wants the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nLet me double-check my reasoning. In the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. In the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the constant term is 20. When you multiply these two expansions together, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by every term in the second part, including the constant term 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, specifically the coefficient when multiplied by \\(c^0\\), is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So, I think the final answer is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Multiplying these together gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\boxed{120}"

    "text": " \n\nSo, for \\((a + b)^4\\), the expansion would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{0}a^4b^0 + \\dbinom{4}{1}a^3b^1 + \\dbinom{4}{2}a^2b^2 + \\dbinom{4}{3}a^1b^3 + \\dbinom{4}{4}a^0b^4\\). Calculating the coefficients, that's \\(1a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + 1b^4\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in this expansion is 6. But wait, the problem isn't just \\((a + b)^4\\), it's multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I need to consider how this multiplication affects the coefficient. \n\nLet me think. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when I expand this, each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But the question is specifically asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). That means I need to find the term where the variables are \\(a^2b^2\\) and then see how it's multiplied by terms from the second expansion. \n\nWait, but in the second expansion, the variables are \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), which are different from \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). So, does that mean that the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms are independent of the \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) terms? So, when I multiply them, the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) won't be affected by the \\(c\\) terms. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression should just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because the \\(c\\) terms don't interfere with the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. \n\nWait, but that doesn't seem right. Because when you multiply two polynomials, each term from the first polynomial is multiplied by each term from the second, and if you're looking for a specific term, like \\(a^2b^2\\), it's only multiplied by the constant term from the second polynomial, right? Because \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term without any \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), so when multiplied by the second polynomial, it would just be \\(a^2b^2\\) times whatever term in the second expansion gives a constant (i.e., \\(c^0\\)), because \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\). \n\nWait, but actually, no, because the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term without any \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), that would only come from multiplying \\(a^2b^2\\) by the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Because if you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by a term that has \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), then the resulting term would have \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or something, which isn't what we're looking for. So, the only contribution to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from multiplying \\(a^2b^2\\) by the constant term in the second expansion. \n\nSo, first, let me find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). To do that, I can use the binomial theorem again. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(1/c\\right)^k\\). Simplifying each term, that becomes \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} c^{-k}\\), which is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). \n\nSo, the exponent of \\(c\\) in each term is \\(6 - 2k\\). We want the term where the exponent is 0 because that's the constant term. So, set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} c^{0}\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20. \n\nNow, going back to the original expression, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, as I found earlier. Then, when multiplied by the constant term 20 from the second expansion, the coefficient becomes \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). \n\nWait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake here. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, correct. The constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 20, correct. So, when I multiply these two expansions together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion is multiplied by the constant term 20 from the second expansion, so the coefficient becomes 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nBut wait, let me double-check. Is there any possibility that other terms could contribute to \\(a^2b^2\\)? For example, suppose I have a term in \\((a + b)^4\\) that's \\(a^3b\\) and then multiply it by a term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) that's \\(1/c\\), would that somehow give me \\(a^3b \\times 1/c\\), which would be \\(a^3b c^{-1}\\), which isn't \\(a^2b^2\\), so that doesn't contribute. Similarly, any other term would involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), so they wouldn't affect the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. \n\nTherefore, I think my reasoning is correct. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120. \n\nWait, but just to be thorough, let me consider the entire expression. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). When I expand this, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion is multiplied by every term in the second expansion, but only the constant term in the second expansion will result in a term that's just \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms. All other terms from the second expansion will have \\(c\\) raised to some power, so they won't contribute to the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. \n\nTherefore, the coefficient is indeed the product of the coefficients from each expansion: 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nI think that's it. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break down the problem into two parts using the binomial theorem.\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\):**\n   Using the binomial theorem, the expansion is:\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n\n2. **Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   The expansion is:\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n   \\]\n   The constant term (where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0) occurs when \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\). The coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n\n3. **Combine the results:**\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficients from each expansion:\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 20 = 120\n   \\]\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

So, I need to consider the entire expression. But I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Hmm, so maybe I don't need to worry about the \\(c\\) terms when looking for \\(a^2b^2\\)? Because \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), right? So, perhaps the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just the same as the coefficient in \\((a + b)^4\\), multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nWait, no, that might not be right. Because when you multiply two expressions, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression. So, if I have \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But I'm only interested in the terms where the variables are \\(a^2b^2\\), and the \\(c\\) terms can be anything because they don't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. So, maybe the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't make sense because when you multiply, the coefficients would add up in some way. \n\nWait, no, actually, when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each polynomial. But in this case, since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), maybe the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are independent of those involving \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because when you multiply by each term in the second expression, each term in the first expression gets scaled by each term in the second, and since we're only interested in \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, we can just take the coefficient from the first part and multiply it by the sum of all coefficients in the second part. \n\nWait, let me think again. Suppose I have two expressions, one in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and another in \\(c\\). When I multiply them, the variables are independent, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient from the first expression times the entire second expression evaluated at the coefficients, but since the second expression has terms with \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), unless we're looking for a specific term involving \\(c\\), the coefficients from the second expression would just add up as a multiplier. \n\nBut actually, no, because the second expression isn't being evaluated at a specific value; it's part of the product. So, if I have \\((a + b)^4\\) times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), then each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of what happens with \\(c\\), then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that can't be right because the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) has multiple terms, and each would contribute to the overall coefficient. \n\nWait, no, actually, when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term is the sum of the products of coefficients from each polynomial whose variables multiply to give that term. But in this case, since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), the variables don't interfere. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Because each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is being multiplied by each term in \\((a + b)^4\\), and since we only care about the \\(a^2b^2\\) term, all the \\(c\\) terms just contribute a scalar multiple. \n\nWait, but how do I find the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\)? The sum of all coefficients in a polynomial is found by plugging in \\(c = 1\\). So, if I substitute \\(c = 1\\) into \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), I get \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 64. \n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by 64. As I calculated earlier, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. So, 6 multiplied by 64 is 384. \n\nWait, but let me verify this because I might be making a mistake. Let me think again. If I have two polynomials, \\(P(a, b)\\) and \\(Q(c)\\), then the product \\(P(a, b) \\times Q(c)\\) will have terms where each term of \\(P\\) is multiplied by each term of \\(Q\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(P(a, b)\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(Q(c)\\). Because for each term in \\(P(a, b)\\), it gets multiplied by every term in \\(Q(c)\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just the original coefficient times the sum of coefficients in \\(Q(c)\\). \n\nYes, that makes sense. So, in this case, \\(P(a, b) = (a + b)^4\\), and \\(Q(c) = \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(P(a, b)\\) is 6, and the sum of coefficients in \\(Q(c)\\) is 64, so the overall coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nAlternatively, another way to think about it is that the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) can be written as \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). When expanding, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Since we're only interested in the \\(a^2b^2\\) term, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) will be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 64. So, 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me think about it differently. Suppose I write the entire expression as \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Let me consider that when I expand this, each term will be of the form \\(C \\times a^{k}b^{4 - k} \\times c^{m} \\times (1/c)^{6 - m}\\), where \\(C\\) is the binomial coefficient. But since I'm only interested in the terms where \\(a^2b^2\\), that means \\(k = 2\\), so the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Now, for each such term, it's multiplied by every term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}c^{m}(1/c)^{6 - m} = \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{2m - 6}\\). \n\nBut since I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), the total coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the sum over all \\(m\\) of \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\dbinom{6}{m}\\). Wait, no, that's not quite right. Because for each term in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is \\(a^2b^2\\), it's multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which has coefficients \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\). So, the total coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} \\times \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m}\\). \n\nBut \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} = 2^6 = 64\\), so the total coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nYes, that seems consistent. So, I think the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(2^6 = 64\\). Multiplying these gives \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n\\boxed{384}"

I'm specifically looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). That would correspond to the term where \\(a\\) is squared and \\(b\\) is squared.

Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating it.\n\nWait, no. Let me think again. The expression is a product of two polynomials: one in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the other in \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). Since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\) at all, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product will be the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients in the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But actually, that's not correct because when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial, but since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is to multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by the constant term (if any) in the second polynomial. Wait, but \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) doesn't have a constant term unless when expanded, the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. So, perhaps I need to check if there's a term with \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion, which would be a constant term, and then multiply that constant term by the coefficient from the first part.\n\nLet me clarify: the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), and to get the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, I need to multiply it by the sum of all the coefficients in the second part, but only the terms that don't involve \\(c\\).

But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), that means we're only interested in the terms where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out, i.e., \\(c^0\\), because otherwise, the term would have \\(c\\) raised to some power, making it \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2c^{-k}\\), which isn't just \\(a^2b^2\\). So, to get \\(a^2b^2\\), we need to multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by the constant term in the second expansion. \n\nSo, first, I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).

So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in this part is 6. \n\nBut wait, the original expression is \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I need to consider both parts. I think the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will come from multiplying a term from the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) with a term from the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). However, since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) don't appear in the second part, which only has \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), the multiplication won't affect the powers of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). That means the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6. \n\nWait, hold on. Let me make sure I'm not missing anything. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product of two expressions. Since the second expression only involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), which are different variables from \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), when we multiply the two expansions, each term in the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. However, since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) don't appear in the second expansion, the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) won't change when multiplied. Therefore, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will only come from the first expansion, and the second expansion will just contribute a factor that is multiplied by this term. But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and not considering any \\(c\\) terms, I think that the coefficient is just 6 multiplied by whatever the entire second expansion is. Wait, no, that doesn't make sense because the second expansion is being multiplied as a whole. \n\nWait, perhaps I need to think differently. Let me clarify: The problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). That means I'm looking for the term where \\(a\\) is squared, \\(b\\) is squared, and the rest of the variables are from the second part. But since the second part doesn't have \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by some term from the second expansion, but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, we can think of it as the coefficient in the first part times the entire second expansion, but that doesn't seem right because the coefficient is a scalar, not an expression. \n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Let me try again. The entire expression is a product of two polynomials. When you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part will be multiplied by every term in the second part. However, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would include all the terms from the second expansion multiplied by the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. But that would mean the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which doesn't make sense because the coefficient should be a number, not an expression with variables. \n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the question. Is the problem asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the powers of \\(c\\)? So, perhaps it's just the coefficient from the first part, since the second part doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, and it's multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part, but since the question is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), it's just 6. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is expecting me to consider the entire expansion, but since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), their coefficients don't get affected by the \\(c\\) terms. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) remains 6, and the rest of the terms involving \\(c\\) are just along for the ride, so to speak. \n\nLet me check this. Let's say I have \\((a + b)^4 = A + B + C + D + E\\), where each letter represents the terms with different powers of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). Then, when I multiply by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which I'll call \\(F\\), the result is \\(A \\cdot F + B \\cdot F + C \\cdot F + D \\cdot F + E \\cdot F\\). So, each term from the first expansion is multiplied by the entire second expansion. Therefore, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion is \\(C\\), which is \\(6a^2b^2\\). When multiplied by \\(F\\), it becomes \\(6a^2b^2F\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is \\(6F\\), which is \\(6 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), not a constant. \n\nWait, but the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). If it's asking for the coefficient regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, then maybe it's just 6. But if it's asking for the coefficient in the entire expression, considering all variables, then perhaps it's 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't make sense because coefficients are scalars, not expressions. \n\nWait, maybe the problem is phrased differently. Perhaps it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some \\(k\\), but it's just asking for \\(a^2b^2\\), which might imply that we're considering the coefficient independent of \\(c\\). But that doesn't quite make sense either because \\(c\\) is part of the expression. \n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think again. The problem is: What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, in the entire product, we're looking for all terms that have \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, each such term would be \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by some combination of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. But that would mean the coefficient is \\(6 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial in \\(c\\). \n\nBut the problem is asking for the coefficient, which is a number. So, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question. Maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the constant term with respect to \\(c\\). That is, the term where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out. So, in that case, I would need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) and then multiply it by the coefficient from the first part, which is 6. \n\nWait, that makes more sense. Because if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms, then it's the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is the constant term in the second expansion. So, let's go with that. \n\nSo, first, let's find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6. Then, we need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Let's compute that. \n\nUsing the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(1/c\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\). So, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). \n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire expression is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) (assuming we're considering the constant term with respect to \\(c\\)) is 120. \n\nWait, but the problem didn't specify anything about \\(c\\). It just said the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, maybe I'm still overcomplicating it. If the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, then it's just 6, because the other part is multiplied as a whole. But in that case, the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because coefficients are scalars. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is written incorrectly, and it should be asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). Or maybe it's expecting just the coefficient from the first part, ignoring the second part. But that seems unlikely because the entire expression is a product. \n\nWait, let me think differently. Maybe the problem is written as \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), and we need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), treating \\(c\\) as another variable. So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, not a number. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, considering all possible terms, but since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by each term in the second expansion, but that still doesn't make sense because coefficients are scalars. \n\nWait, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, ignoring the second part. But that seems too simple, and the problem mentions both parts. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, which would be 6 times the entire expansion of the second part. But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, which doesn't make sense. \n\nWait, perhaps I need to interpret the problem as finding the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, so the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that seems odd because the coefficient is usually a scalar. \n\nWait, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the powers of \\(c\\), meaning that we're looking for all terms where \\(a\\) is squared and \\(b\\) is squared, and the rest can be anything with \\(c\\). But in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial, not a scalar. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is expecting me to recognize that since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is simply 6, and the rest of the terms involving \\(c\\) are separate. But that seems inconsistent with how coefficients work in products of polynomials. \n\nWait, maybe I should think of it this way: When you have two polynomials multiplied together, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each polynomial, provided that the variables multiply appropriately. But in this case, since the first polynomial has variables \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the second has \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), the variables don't interfere with each other. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial multiplied by the entire second polynomial. But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, which doesn't make sense. \n\nWait, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, considering that \\(c\\) can be any term, but we're just focusing on \\(a^2b^2\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but that's not a single coefficient. \n\nI think I'm going in circles here. Let me try to approach it differently. Maybe the problem is expecting me to consider that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just 6, and the rest of the expression is multiplied as a whole, but since the question is only about \\(a^2b^2\\), the coefficient remains 6. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is written incorrectly, and it's supposed to be \\((a + b + c + 1/c)^{10}\\) or something similar, but as it stands, it's \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). \n\nWait, another thought: Maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, meaning that we can treat the entire second part as a constant. But that doesn't make sense because the second part is a variable expression. \n\nWait, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating \\(c\\) as a variable, so the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem doesn't specify that, so I think that's unlikely. \n\nWait, maybe I should consider that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the product of the coefficients from each part. But that's not correct because the variables are separate. \n\nWait, no, when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficients multiply if the variables are the same, but here, the variables are different. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is just the coefficient from the first part, because the second part doesn't affect \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). So, the coefficient remains 6. \n\nBut earlier, I thought that might be the case, but then I started doubting myself. Let me confirm with an example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^1 \\times (c + 1/c)^1 = (a + b)(c + 1/c)\\). The expansion would be \\(ac + a/c + bc + b/c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a\\) is \\(c + 1/c\\), which is a polynomial, not a scalar. Similarly, the coefficient of \\(b\\) is \\(c + 1/c\\). So, in this case, the coefficient of \\(a\\) is not just 1, but it's multiplied by the entire second polynomial. \n\nTherefore, in our original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that's a polynomial, not a scalar. So, perhaps the problem is expecting me to recognize that the coefficient is a polynomial, but that seems unlikely because it's asking for the coefficient, which is typically a scalar. \n\nWait, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\). In that case, we need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) and then multiply it by the coefficient from the first part. \n\nSo, let's do that. As I calculated earlier, the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). So, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) with no \\(c\\) terms, the answer is 120. \n\nBut the problem didn't specify the \\(c\\) terms, so I'm not sure. However, given that the problem includes both \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), it's likely that it's expecting the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which would be 6. But earlier, I saw that in a simpler case, the coefficient is a polynomial, not a scalar. \n\nWait, maybe I need to think of it in terms of generating functions. If I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), it's the sum over all terms in the product where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2 and 2, respectively, and the exponents of \\(c\\) can be anything. So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that's a polynomial, which doesn't make sense as a coefficient. \n\nAlternatively, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it's 120. Since the problem didn't specify, but given the structure, I think it's more likely that it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), which would be 6 times the entire expansion of the second part. But that's a polynomial, not a scalar. \n\nWait, perhaps the problem is expecting me to recognize that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, and the rest of the expression is separate. So, the answer is 6. But I'm not entirely sure. \n\nWait, let me think again. The problem is: What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, in the entire product, each term is of the form \\(a^kb^{4 - k}c^m c^{-n}\\), where \\(k\\) ranges from 0 to 4, and \\(m, n\\) come from the exponents in the second part. But the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the sum over all terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any combination of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of the second part. But that's a polynomial, not a scalar. \n\nWait, but the problem is asking for the coefficient, which is a scalar. So, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be 120. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is written incorrectly, and it's supposed to be \\((a + b + c + 1/c)^{10}\\), but as it is, it's two separate expressions multiplied together. \n\nWait, perhaps I should consider that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just 6, and the rest of the expression is multiplied as a whole, but since the question is only about \\(a^2b^2\\), the coefficient remains 6. \n\nBut in the example I did earlier, with \\((a + b)(c + 1/c)\\), the coefficient of \\(a\\) is \\(c + 1/c\\), which is a polynomial, not a scalar. So, in that case, the coefficient is not just the coefficient from the first part, but it's multiplied by the entire second expansion. \n\nTherefore, in our original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that's a polynomial, not a scalar. So, perhaps the problem is expecting me to recognize that, but since it's asking for the coefficient, which is a scalar, maybe I'm missing something. \n\nWait, another thought: Maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, considering that \\(c\\) can be any power, but we're only interested in the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by the constant term in the second expansion. So, that would be 6 times 20, which is 120. \n\nBut again, the problem didn't specify that, but perhaps that's the intended interpretation. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, meaning that the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of the second part. But that's a polynomial, not a scalar. \n\nWait, perhaps the problem is expecting me to recognize that since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just 6, and the rest of the terms involving \\(c\\) are separate. So, the answer is 6. \n\nBut in that case, why include the second part? It seems like it's part of the problem, so I think the intended answer is 120, considering the constant term in the second expansion. \n\nLet me try to confirm. If I consider the entire expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), and I want the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), that would mean I'm looking for all terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial. But since the problem is asking for the coefficient, which is a scalar, I must have misunderstood. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. \n\nGiven that, I think the intended answer is 120. So, I'll go with that.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then finding the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20. Multiplying these together gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\(\\boxed{120}\\)"

Calculating the coefficients, that would be \\(1a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + 1b^4\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in this part is 6. \n\nBut wait, the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I need to consider how that affects the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are variables separate from \\(c\\), I think the coefficients from the \\(c\\) terms will multiply the coefficients from the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nBut hold on, the problem only asks for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). That means I don't need to worry about the terms involving \\(c\\), right? Because \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), so when I multiply it by any term from the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) will be the sum of the products of the coefficients from each part. \n\nWait, no, actually, that might not be correct. Because \\(a^2b^2\\) is part of the product of the two expressions, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because when you multiply two expressions, the coefficients multiply term by term. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nBut wait, is that right? Let me think again. If I have two expressions, say, \\(P(a, b)\\) and \\(Q(c)\\), then the product \\(P(a, b) \\times Q(c)\\) would have terms where each term in \\(P\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(Q\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(P(a, b)\\) multiplied by the entire sum of terms in \\(Q(c)\\), because each term in \\(Q(c)\\) is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is indeed the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(P(a, b)\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(Q(c)\\). \n\nSo, first, let me find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which I already did: it's 6. Now, I need to find the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). To find the sum of all coefficients in a polynomial, I can substitute \\(c = 1\\) because that will make each term equal to its coefficient. So, substituting \\(c = 1\\) into \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) gives \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). \n\nTherefore, the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 64. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). \n\nWait, but let me double-check. Is there another way to approach this problem? Maybe by considering the entire expansion and looking for the term that has \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). But since \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) are separate variables, and we're only concerned with the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient would indeed be the product of the coefficients from each part. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of the entire expression as a product of two polynomials, one in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the other in \\(c\\). When multiplying, the terms from the first polynomial are multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first polynomial will be multiplied by every term in the second polynomial. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial. \n\nYes, that makes sense. So, 6 multiplied by 64 is indeed 384. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 384. \n\nI think that's correct. Let me just recap to make sure I didn't miss anything. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient is the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6, and the sum of coefficients in the second part is 64, so 6 times 64 is 384. \n\nI don't think I made any mistakes here. The key was realizing that the coefficient of a term not involving other variables is the product of the coefficients from each part, considering that the other part's sum of coefficients is effectively the total contribution. So, yeah, 384 should be the correct coefficient.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is found by multiplying the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) by the sum of all coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\n1.

    "text": " \n\nUsing the binomial theorem, \\((a + b)^4 = \\dbinom{4}{0}a^4b^0 + \\dbinom{4}{1}a^3b^1 + \\dbinom{4}{2}a^2b^2 + \\dbinom{4}{3}a^1b^3 + \\dbinom{4}{4}a^0b^4\\). Calculating the coefficients, that's \\(1a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + 1b^4\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) here is 6. \n\nBut wait, the problem isn't just \\((a + b)^4\\); it's multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. Hmm, but \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are only in the first part, and \\(c\\) is only in the second part. So, when I multiply them together, the variables \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are separate. \n\nThat means the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion is multiplied by every term in the second expansion, which is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since the problem only asks for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and that term is separate from \\(c\\), I think the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression will just be the same as the coefficient in the first part, which is 6, multiplied by whatever the entire second part is. Wait, no, actually, that's not quite right. Because when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. But since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term in the first polynomial and the second polynomial has terms with \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), the product will have terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), etc. But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). Hmm, is that correct? \n\nWait, no, actually, in the entire expression, each term will be a product of a term from the first expansion and a term from the second expansion. So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I need to consider all the terms in the second expansion, because when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), they will give terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), etc. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which suggests that it's considering all possible powers of \\(c\\). Wait, but actually, no, because in the original expression, the entire product is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the variables are \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\), and the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would include all possible powers of \\(c\\) multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). But that doesn't make sense because \\(a^2b^2\\) isn't a term that includes \\(c\\). \n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, maybe the problem is considering the entire expression as a polynomial in \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\), and it's asking for the coefficient of the term \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). That is, all terms where \\(a\\) is squared, \\(b\\) is squared, and \\(c\\) can be any power. So, the coefficient would be the sum of the coefficients from all the terms in the expansion where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present, multiplied by any power of \\(c\\). \n\nBut that seems a bit complicated. Alternatively, maybe the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable, so it's just 6 times the entire expansion of the second part. But that would mean the coefficient is 6 times whatever the second part is, but that doesn't make sense because the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would then be a polynomial in \\(c\\), not a single number. \n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Maybe the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, so the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by the entire second expansion, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times each term in the second expansion would contribute to the overall coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. But actually, no, because each term in the second expansion is a power of \\(c\\), so when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by \\(c^6\\), you get \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), and when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by \\(c^4\\), you get \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), etc. So, each of these would be separate terms, and the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually be the sum of all the coefficients from the second expansion, because each term in the second expansion, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), contributes to a term that has \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by some power of \\(c\\). \n\nWait, but the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so perhaps it's considering the entire expression as a product, and the term \\(a^2b^2\\) can be multiplied by any power of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients of all terms in the second expansion, because each term in the second expansion is a coefficient times a power of \\(c\\), and when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), it becomes \\(6 \\times\\) (coefficient from second expansion) times \\(a^2b^2c^k\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so perhaps it's just 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. \n\nWait, but the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion is found by plugging in \\(c = 1\\). So, if I set \\(c = 1\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), I get \\((1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times 64, which is 384. \n\nBut wait, let me think again. When I expand \\((a + b)^4\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) has a coefficient of 6, and when I multiply this by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which expands to a sum of terms each with their own coefficients and powers of \\(c\\), the result is that \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each of those terms. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would indeed be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. Since the sum of coefficients is 64, the total coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nBut let me double-check this approach. Another way to think about it is that the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). When you expand this, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, which has terms like \\(c^6\\), \\(6c^4\\), \\(15c^2\\), \\(20\\), \\(15c^{-2}\\), \\(6c^{-4}\\), and \\(c^{-6}\\). So, when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each of these, you get terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(6a^2b^2c^4\\), \\(15a^2b^2c^2\\), \\(20a^2b^2\\), \\(15a^2b^2c^{-2}\\), \\(6a^2b^2c^{-4}\\), and \\(a^2b^2c^{-6}\\). \n\nNow, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in the entire product, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the sum of the coefficients from all these terms. That is, 1 (from \\(c^6\\)) + 6 (from \\(c^4\\)) + 15 (from \\(c^2\\)) + 20 (from \\(c^0\\)) + 15 (from \\(c^{-2}\\)) + 6 (from \\(c^{-4}\\)) + 1 (from \\(c^{-6}\\)). Adding these up: 1 + 6 = 7, 7 +15=22, 22+20=42, 42+15=57, 57+6=63, 63+1=64. So, the sum is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 (from the first expansion) times 64 (the sum of coefficients from the second expansion), which is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nWait, but hold on, in the second expansion, each term has its own coefficient, and when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), those coefficients are added together to get the total coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) across all powers of \\(c\\). So, the total coefficient is indeed 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nAlternatively, another way to approach this is to recognize that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is equal to the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion and the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. Since the sum of coefficients in the second expansion is found by substituting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\), as I did earlier. So, multiplying 6 by 64 gives 384. \n\nTherefore, I think the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is 384. \n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. Another approach is to consider the entire expansion and see if I can find the coefficient directly. Let me try expanding both parts separately and then see how they interact. \n\nFirst, expanding \\((a + b)^4\\) as I did before gives \\(a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). Now, expanding \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem: \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\times (1/c)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, the terms are:\n\n- For k=0: \\(\\dbinom{6}{0}c^6 = 1 \\times c^6 = c^6\\)\n- k=1: \\(\\dbinom{6}{1}c^4 = 6c^4\\)\n- k=2: \\(\\dbinom{6}{2}c^2 = 15c^2\\)\n- k=3: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}c^0 = 20\\)\n- k=4: \\(\\dbinom{6}{4}c^{-2} = 15c^{-2}\\)\n- k=5: \\(\\dbinom{6}{5}c^{-4} = 6c^{-4}\\)\n- k=6: \\(\\dbinom{6}{6}c^{-6} = c^{-6}\\)\n\nSo, the expansion is \\(c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15c^{-2} + 6c^{-4} + c^{-6}\\).\n\nNow, when I multiply this by \\((a + b)^4\\), each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second. So, for the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion, it will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(6a^2b^2c^4\\), etc. \n\nBut the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in the entire product, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion, because each term in the second expansion, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), contributes to a term that has \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by some power of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(6 \\times (1 + 6 + 15 + 20 + 15 + 6 + 1)\\), which is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). \n\nWait, but another way to think about it is that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and the sum of all coefficients in the second part. So, 6 times 64 is indeed 384. \n\nI think that makes sense. So, the final answer should be 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\(2^6 = 64\\). Multiplying these together, \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n\\boxed{384}"

    "text": " \n\nSo, for \\((a + b)^4\\), the expansion would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{0}a^4b^0 + \\dbinom{4}{1}a^3b^1 + \\dbinom{4}{2}a^2b^2 + \\dbinom{4}{3}a^1b^3 + \\dbinom{4}{4}a^0b^4\\). Calculating the coefficients, that becomes \\(1 \\cdot a^4 + 4 \\cdot a^3b + 6 \\cdot a^2b^2 + 4 \\cdot ab^3 + 1 \\cdot b^4\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) here is 6. \n\nWait, but the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, which is \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, that means I also have to consider the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Hmm, but how does that affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)? \n\nI think that since the two parts are multiplied together, any term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by every term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). However, since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I don't need to worry about the terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), right? Because \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), so when I multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by any term from the second expansion, the \\(c\\) terms will just tag along, but the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by any power of \\(c\\) will still be 6 times the corresponding coefficient from the second expansion. \n\nWait, no, that's not quite right. Actually, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but it doesn't specify any particular power of \\(c\\). Hmm, so maybe I'm supposed to consider all possible terms where the power of \\(c\\) cancels out, so that the term is just \\(a^2b^2\\) times a constant. Or perhaps the problem is just considering the coefficient in the product, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. Hmm, maybe I need to clarify.\n\nWait, actually, looking back at the problem, it says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\". Since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), I think that when they ask for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), they are considering all terms where the variables are \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by some power of \\(c\\). But maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, meaning that we can treat the two parts separately. So, perhaps the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 times the sum of all terms in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't make sense because the sum of all terms in that expansion is a number, not a term with \\(c\\). Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that seems odd because then the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\), not a constant. Hmm, maybe I need to re-express the problem.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times some power of \\(c\\), but without any specific power of \\(c\\). Alternatively, maybe it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when all the \\(c\\) terms are considered, but that seems unclear. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only about the part \\((a + b)^4\\), and the other part is just a red herring, but that doesn't make sense either.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again. The problem is: What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when you multiply two expressions, the coefficient of a particular term in the product is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each factor. But in this case, since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are in one factor and \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) are in the other, the terms in the first factor don't involve \\(c\\), and the terms in the second factor don't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\). So, when you multiply, each term from the first factor will be multiplied by each term from the second factor. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the first factor, and it will be multiplied by every term from the second factor. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first factor multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second factor.\n\nWait, that might make sense. Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, each term will contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times some power of \\(c\\). But if we're just looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms, perhaps we need to find terms where the powers of \\(c\\) cancel out. Hmm, that might be it. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\) would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). \n\nWait, that sounds plausible. So, first, let me compute the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\cdot (1/c)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, the exponent of \\(c\\) is \\(6 - 2k\\). We want the exponent to be 0, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which implies \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\), which is 20. \n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20, and the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\) in the entire expression is 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nWait, but the problem didn't specify any power of \\(c\\), just \\(a^2b^2\\). So, does that mean that it's considering all possible powers of \\(c\\)? Or is it specifically \\(c^0\\)? Hmm, maybe I need to think again. \n\nWait, perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which would result in a polynomial in \\(c\\). But that seems odd because the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would then be a polynomial, not a single number. So, maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be 120. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) irrespective of the \\(c\\) terms, meaning that it's 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. The sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) would be when we set \\(c = 1\\), so substituting \\(c = 1\\), we get \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of coefficients is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nWait, but that seems high. Let me think again. When you expand \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in the expansion is of the form \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}a^{4 - k}b^k \\cdot \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - m}(1/c)^m = \\dbinom{4}{k}\\dbinom{6}{m} a^{4 - k}b^k c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) occurs when \\(k = 2\\), so the coefficient from the first part is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Then, the coefficient from the second part for any \\(m\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\). So, the total coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^{6 - 2m}\\) is \\(6 \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}\\). \n\nBut if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then it's the sum over all \\(m\\) of \\(6 \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}\\), which would be \\(6 \\times 2^6 = 6 \\times 64 = 384\\). Alternatively, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then we need to find the value of \\(m\\) such that \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which gives \\(m = 3\\), so the coefficient would be \\(6 \\times \\dbinom{6}{3} = 6 \\times 20 = 120\\). \n\nHmm, so which one is it? The problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\". Since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term without \\(c\\), but in the product, each term will have some power of \\(c\\). So, unless the problem is considering all terms where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out, meaning \\(c^0\\), the coefficient would actually be a sum over all possible \\(c\\) terms. But I think the problem is more likely asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. \n\nWait, but let me check the problem statement again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" It doesn't specify any \\(c\\) terms, so maybe it's just looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\). But in that case, the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 times a polynomial in \\(c\\). But that doesn't make sense because a coefficient should be a constant, not a polynomial. So, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is written in a way that \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are all variables, and they just want the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\). But that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nWait, let me think about this again. When you have two expressions multiplied together, the coefficient of a term like \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the product of the coefficients of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expression and the coefficient of 1 in the second expression. But the second expression doesn't have a constant term unless we consider \\(c^0\\). Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only considering the terms where the \\(c\\) terms cancel out, so that the overall term is just \\(a^2b^2\\). \n\nWait, perhaps I should approach it differently. Let me consider that the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). If I expand both parts, each term in the expansion of the first part is multiplied by each term in the expansion of the second part. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first part, and it's multiplied by every term in the second part, which is a sum of terms involving \\(c^k\\) and \\(c^{-k}\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. Because each term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, so the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients of the second expansion. \n\nThe sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), so \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was 120. So, which is it? I'm getting confused. Let me try to clarify. \n\nIf the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, then it's 6 times the entire expansion of the second part, which would be 6 * 64 = 384. But if it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it's 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nWait, perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and since \\(c\\) is a separate variable, the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of the second part, meaning that the coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nBut I'm not entirely sure. Let me check with an example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^2 (c + 1/c)^1\\). Expanding this, we get \\((a^2 + 2ab + b^2)(c + 1/c)\\). The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be zero because \\(a^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), but \\(b^2\\) isn't present in the first expansion. Wait, no, that's not the right example. Let me take a better example.\n\nSuppose I have \\((a + b)^1 (c + 1/c)^1\\). Expanding, we get \\((a + b)(c + 1/c)\\). The term \\(a\\) is multiplied by \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), and the term \\(b\\) is also multiplied by \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, the product has terms like \\(ac\\), \\(a/c\\), \\(bc\\), \\(b/c\\). There is no \\(a^2b^2\\) term here because the first factor is only to the first power. \n\nWait, perhaps my initial approach was wrong. Maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, in that case, since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term in the first part, and the second part is multiplied by it, the coefficient would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Because each term in the second part contributes to the coefficient when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). \n\nSo, the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is found by substituting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\(2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). \n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was 120, so I need to resolve this confusion. Let me think again. The problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). \n\nIn the product, each term is of the form \\(a^{4 - k}b^k c^{6 - m}c^{-m} = a^{4 - k}b^k c^{6 - 2m}\\), where \\(k\\) ranges from 0 to 4 and \\(m\\) ranges from 0 to 6. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) occurs when \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). So, the coefficient from the first part is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). \n\nNow, for each \\(m\\), the term in the second part is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, when we multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each of these terms, we get terms like \\(6 \\dbinom{6}{m} a^2b^2c^{6 - 2m}\\). \n\nIf the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then the coefficient would be the sum over all \\(m\\) of \\(6 \\dbinom{6}{m}\\), which is \\(6 \\times 2^6 = 6 \\times 64 = 384\\). \n\nHowever, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then we need to find the \\(m\\) such that \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which gives \\(m = 3\\). The coefficient in that case would be \\(6 \\times \\dbinom{6}{3} = 6 \\times 20 = 120\\). \n\nGiven that the problem doesn't specify any power of \\(c\\), I think it's more likely that it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), which would be 384. But I'm not entirely sure. \n\nWait, let me think about the problem statement again. It says, \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" Since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term in the product, but in the product, each term has some power of \\(c\\), the problem might be expecting the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), which is 120. Alternatively, it might be expecting the sum over all \\(c\\) terms, which is 384. \n\nTo resolve this, perhaps I should consider that in the product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by every term from the second expansion, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nAlternatively, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it's 120. \n\nWait, perhaps the problem is written in a way that it's only considering the variables \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) is a separate variable, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the entire expansion of the second part, which is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nBut I'm still not entirely sure. Let me try to find another approach. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, so the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\). But that seems unlikely because the problem is asking for a single coefficient. So, perhaps it's expecting the coefficient when the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out, i.e., \\(c^0\\). \n\nIn that case, the coefficient would be 120. \n\nWait, let me check the problem statement again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" It doesn't specify any \\(c\\) terms, so maybe it's just 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nWait, but in the expansion, each term is \\(a^{4 - k}b^k c^{6 - 2m}\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the sum over all \\(m\\) of \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nAlternatively, if the problem is only considering the term where \\(c\\) cancels out, then it's 120. \n\nHmm, I think I need to make a decision here. Since the problem didn't specify any \\(c\\) terms, I think it's more likely that it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which would be 384. \n\nWait, but let me think about how coefficients work in products. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the sum of all products of coefficients from the first and second expansions where the variables match. But in this case, the variables \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are only in the first expansion, and \\(c\\) is only in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by every term in the second expansion, so the coefficient would be 6 times the entire second expansion. But that's a polynomial, not a single coefficient. So, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. \n\nWait, that makes more sense. Because if you're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms, you need to find the term where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out, which happens when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), so \\(m = 3\\), giving the coefficient as 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nSo, I think the correct answer is 120. \n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem to expand each part separately.\n\nFirst, we expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n\\]\nThe term containing \\(a^2b^2\\) is:\n\\[\n\\dbinom{4}{2} a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\n\\]\nSo, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\nNext, we consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem:\n\\[\n\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n\\]\nWe need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, which occurs when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(m = 3\\). The coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is:\n\\[\n\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\n\\]\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is the product of the coefficients from each part:\n\\[\n6 \\times 20 = 120\n\\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}."

    "text": " \n\nSo, for \\((a + b)^4\\), the expansion would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{0}a^4b^0 + \\dbinom{4}{1}a^3b^1 + \\dbinom{4}{2}a^2b^2 + \\dbinom{4}{3}a^1b^3 + \\dbinom{4}{4}a^0b^4\\). Calculating the coefficients, that would be \\(1a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + 1b^4\\). Okay, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) here is 6. \n\nBut wait, the problem isn't just \\((a + b)^4\\), it's multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I need to consider the entire expression. Hmm, so does that mean I have to multiply each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)? That sounds complicated, but maybe I don't need to expand everything. \n\nLet me think. The question is specifically asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are only from the first part, right? Because the second part is in terms of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, when I multiply them, the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms will come from the first expansion, and the \\(c\\) terms will come from the second expansion. \n\nSo, if I'm looking for \\(a^2b^2\\), that term comes from the first part, specifically from the \\(6a^2b^2\\) term. Now, when I multiply this by the second expansion, which is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), I need to consider how this multiplication affects the coefficient. \n\nWait, but actually, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term is just a scalar (the coefficient 6) multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), and then when I multiply by the entire second expansion, each term in the second expansion will be multiplied by this 6. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and the second expansion doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product will just be 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nBut that doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), so maybe the \\(c\\) terms don't affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Let me try to break it down more clearly.\n\nThe entire expression is a product of two expansions: one in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and one in \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). When we multiply these two, each term from the first expansion is multiplied by each term from the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the first expansion, and when multiplied by any term from the second expansion, it will create terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2 \\cdot c^{-k}\\), depending on the term in the second expansion. \n\nHowever, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, but in the product, \\(a^2b^2\\) would only appear if we multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by a term that is \\(c^0\\), because otherwise, the term would have \\(c\\) in it. So, actually, the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is to multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first expansion by the term that has \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion. \n\nSo, first, let's find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because when we multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by \\(c^0\\), we get \\(a^2b^2\\), which is the term we're interested in. \n\nOkay, so now I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me expand this using the binomial theorem as well. \n\nThe expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k\\). Simplifying that, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} c^{-k} = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). \n\nWe want the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so we set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(6 = 2k\\) which gives \\(k = 3\\). \n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). \n\nSo, the term with \\(c^0\\) is \\(20c^0 = 20\\). \n\nNow, going back to the original product, when we multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first expansion by the \\(c^0\\) term from the second expansion, we get \\(6a^2b^2 \\times 20 = 120a^2b^2\\). \n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120. \n\nWait, let me double-check that. So, in the first expansion, \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. In the second expansion, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. So, when we multiply these two parts together, each term from the first part is multiplied by each term from the second part. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by the constant term 20 from the second part, giving \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\) as the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\). \n\nIs there any other term that could contribute to \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product? Let me think. Suppose I take a term from the first expansion that is not \\(a^2b^2\\) and multiply it by a term from the second expansion that somehow combines to give \\(a^2b^2\\). But wait, the second expansion doesn't have any \\(a\\) or \\(b\\) terms, only \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, when I multiply any term from the first expansion (which has \\(a\\) and \\(b\\)) by any term from the second expansion (which has \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\)), the resulting terms will have both \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) multiplied by some power of \\(c\\). \n\nTherefore, the only way to get a term with just \\(a^2b^2\\) and no \\(c\\) is to multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by \\(c^0\\), which is 20. So, there are no other terms contributing to \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the coefficient is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the second part), which is 120. \n\nWait, just to make sure I didn't make a mistake in calculating the binomial coefficients. Let me recalculate them. \n\nFor the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\), which is \\(\\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\\). That's correct. \n\nFor the second part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\), which is \\(\\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). That's also correct. \n\nSo, multiplying 6 and 20 gives 120, which is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression. \n\nI think that's solid. So, the final answer should be 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem.\n\nFirst, we expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n\\]\nThe term involving \\(a^2b^2\\) is:\n\\[\n\\dbinom{4}{2} a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\n\\]\nSo, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\nNext, we need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).

Calculating the coefficients, that would be \\(1 \\cdot a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + 1b^4\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in this part is 6. \n\nBut wait, the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I need to consider both parts. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first part, and the second part is another binomial expression. So, I think I need to multiply the two expansions together. But since I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), maybe I don't have to expand the entire expression. Instead, I can just find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and then multiply it by the entire second part, because when you multiply two expressions, the coefficients multiply as well, right? \n\nWait, no, that might not be correct. Because actually, when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the entire second part, because the second part doesn't have any a or b terms. Let me think. \n\nSo, \\((a + b)^4\\) is being multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The second part only has terms with c and 1/c, so when I multiply, the a and b terms won't interact with the c terms. That means that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression will just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nWait, but that doesn't sound quite right. Because actually, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, if I have a term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part, and I multiply it by every term in the second part, then \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^5\\), etc. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some k. \n\nOh, wait, maybe I misread the problem. Let me check again. The problem says: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of c. So, in other words, I need to find all the terms in the expansion where the exponents of a and b are 2 each, and then sum their coefficients. \n\nBut in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term is of the form \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}a^{4 - k}b^{k}\\) multiplied by \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - m}\\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\), which simplifies to \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}\\dbinom{6}{m}a^{4 - k}b^{k}c^{6 - 2m}\\). \n\nSo, to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), we need to find all terms where \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). So, \\(4 - k = 2\\) implies \\(k = 2\\). So, the term in the first expansion is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}a^2b^2\\), which is 6a^2b^2. Then, this is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression will be 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nWait, but that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in c, not a single number. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which I think is a scalar. So, maybe I need to clarify. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of c. So, that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which would make the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) equal to 6\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6. But that seems odd because the problem is asking for a coefficient, which is usually a number, not an expression. \n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me try to think differently. Since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, and since the product is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nBut again, that would result in the coefficient being a polynomial in c, which doesn't make sense because the problem is likely expecting a numerical coefficient. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, treating c as a variable independent of a and b. So, the coefficient would be 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that seems non-sensical because coefficients are typically constants, not expressions. \n\nWait, perhaps I'm misinterpreting the problem. Maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), that is, the term where the exponents of a, b, and c are 2, 2, and 0 respectively. That would make sense because then the coefficient would be a number. Let me check the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, it's only specifying \\(a^2b^2\\), not any specific power of c. So, I think the problem is indeed asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of c. \n\nTherefore, in the expansion, every term that has \\(a^2b^2\\) will have that coefficient multiplied by some power of c. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems like an expression, not a number. So, perhaps the problem is expecting the coefficient as a polynomial, but that doesn't make much sense. Alternatively, maybe I need to consider that the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by all the terms in the second expansion, so the coefficient is 6 times the sum of the coefficients of all terms in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nWait, but the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) would be found by setting c = 1. So, if I substitute c = 1, then \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of the coefficients is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nWait, but that seems too straightforward. Let me think again. If I set c = 1, then \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) becomes 2^6 = 64, which is the sum of all coefficients. So, if I multiply the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, by 64, I get 384. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 384. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I should approach this differently. Let's consider the entire expansion. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, as we saw earlier. Then, when we multiply by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that seems to result in a polynomial, not a single coefficient. \n\nWait, but the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so perhaps it's referring to the coefficient as a polynomial in c. So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't seem right because usually, coefficients are constants. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be a specific term where the exponents of a, b, and c are 2, 2, and 0 respectively. \n\nLet me try that approach. So, to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), I need to find all terms in the expansion where a is squared, b is squared, and c is to the zero power. \n\nFirst, from \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. Then, from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), I need the coefficient of \\(c^0\\). The term \\(c^0\\) occurs when the exponents of c and 1/c cancel each other out. In other words, when the exponent of c is m and the exponent of 1/c is m, so that \\(c^{6 - 2m} = c^0\\). Therefore, \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), so \\(m = 3\\). \n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\), which is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire product is 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nWait, so if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of c, then it's 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 times a polynomial. But if it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it's 120. \n\nI think the problem is more likely asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of c, but that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, which doesn't make sense because coefficients are typically constants. Therefore, I think the intended interpretation is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. \n\nLet me confirm this approach. So, in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term is of the form \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}a^{4 - k}b^{k}\\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, to get \\(a^2b^2\\), we need \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). Then, for the c term, we need \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\dbinom{6}{3}\\), which is 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nYes, that makes sense. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is 120. Therefore, I think the answer is 120. \n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in calculating the binomial coefficients. \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) is indeed 6, because 4 choose 2 is (4*3)/(2*1) = 6. And \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\) is 20, because 6 choose 3 is (6*5*4)/(3*2*1) = 20. So, 6 * 20 is 120. \n\nAlternatively, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of c, then it's 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which would be 6 times (c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15/c^2 + 6/c^4 + 1/c^6). But that would make the coefficient a polynomial, which doesn't seem to be what the problem is asking for. Therefore, I think the intended answer is 120. \n\nSo, to recap, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product is 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nI think that's the answer the problem is looking for.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is found by multiplying the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\n1. Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is 6.\n2. Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n3. Multiply these coefficients: \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer:** \\(\\boxed{120}\\)"

So, the terms would be:\n\n- When \\(k = 0\\): \\(\\dbinom{4}{0}a^4b^0 = 1 \\cdot a^4 \\cdot 1 = a^4\\)\n- When \\(k = 1\\): \\(\\dbinom{4}{1}a^3b^1 = 4 \\cdot a^3b\\)\n- When \\(k = 2\\): \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}a^2b^2 = 6 \\cdot a^2b^2\\)\n- When \\(k = 3\\): \\(\\dbinom{4}{3}a^1b^3 = 4 \\cdot ab^3\\)\n- When \\(k = 4\\): \\(\\dbinom{4}{4}a^0b^4 = 1 \\cdot b^4\\)\n\nSo, the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is \\(a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). \n\nNow, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Looking at the expansion, the term with \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(6a^2b^2\\), so its coefficient is 6. But wait, the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I can't just stop here; I need to consider the entire expression. \n\nHmm, so the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when I multiply these two expansions together, I need to find the term where the power of \\(a\\) is 2 and the power of \\(b\\) is 2. But actually, since the second part is in terms of \\(c\\), which is a different variable, the coefficients of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would just be the product of the coefficients from each part. Wait, is that right? Let me think. \n\nBecause when you multiply two expressions, each term from the first expression gets multiplied by each term from the second expression. So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I just need the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiply it by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but wait, no. Wait, actually, no, that's not correct because the variables are different. \n\nWait, actually, in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the variables \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are all distinct. So, when we multiply them, the terms will be products of terms from each expansion. But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Since \\(c\\) is a separate variable, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by some power of \\(c\\), but the coefficient itself is just the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, that doesn't make sense because the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion, but that's not how coefficients work. \n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me clarify: when you have a product of two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each polynomial. But in this case, the first polynomial is in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the second is in \\(c\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial is a term by itself, and when you multiply it by the entire second polynomial, each term in the second polynomial will be multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term in the product, but in the product, \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term from the second polynomial. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is actually the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the entire second polynomial. Wait, but that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\). \n\nWait, but the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some \\(k\\). Hmm, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" \n\nWait, so maybe the question is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would be the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part, because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by the second polynomial, each term in the second polynomial would contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. So, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all terms in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, but the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, so maybe I'm still misunderstanding. \n\nWait, perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable. So, in other words, the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't seem right because coefficients are typically numerical, not expressions involving variables. \n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think differently. Perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some \\(k\\), but it's only specifying \\(a^2b^2\\), so maybe the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that seems odd. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because when you multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), each term in the second polynomial contributes to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. \n\nWait, but the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) would be found by setting \\(c = 1\\). So, if I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of the coefficients is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times 64, which is 384. But that seems too large, and I'm not sure if that's the right approach. \n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me try another approach. Let me consider the entire product \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When you expand this product, each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, which is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nBut wait, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some \\(k\\). So, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), which would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). As I thought earlier, the sum of the coefficients in a polynomial is found by setting all variables to 1. So, setting \\(c = 1\\), we get \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the sum of the coefficients is 64, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nBut wait, that seems high. Let me check my reasoning again. If I have two separate polynomials, one in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and one in \\(c\\), when I multiply them, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would indeed be the coefficient from the first polynomial times the entire second polynomial. But that would mean that the coefficient is a polynomial, not a number. So, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), that is, the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. \n\nWait, that makes more sense. So, perhaps I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is the term where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out. So, in that case, I would need to find the term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, and then multiply that by the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6. \n\nOkay, so let me proceed with that. First, find the term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. \n\nUsing the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\).\n\nWe want the exponent of \\(c\\) to be zero, so we set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\).\n\nSo, the term where \\(k = 3\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} c^{6 - 6} = \\dbinom{6}{3} c^0 = 20 \\times 1 = 20\\).\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20.\n\nNow, going back to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is the product of the coefficients from each part, which is 6 (from \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\)) multiplied by 20 (from \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)), so 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, so that would mean the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120? But earlier I thought it was 384, but that was when considering all coefficients in the second polynomial, which doesn't make sense because then it's not a single coefficient. So, I think the correct approach is to find the term where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out, i.e., \\(c^0\\), and then multiply that coefficient by the coefficient from the first part. \n\nLet me confirm this. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. But since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), but actually, in the product, each term would be \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some \\(k\\). So, unless specified, the problem might just want the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) irrespective of \\(c\\), which would be the entire expansion of the second polynomial multiplied by 6. But that would make the coefficient a polynomial, which doesn't make sense because coefficients are numbers. Therefore, the problem must be asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\). \n\nTherefore, the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nWait, but let me think again. If the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), without any restriction on \\(c\\), then it's ambiguous. However, in the context of such problems, usually, they ask for the coefficient of a specific term, considering all variables. So, perhaps the problem is indeed asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is considering that \\(c\\) is a variable independent of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), so when you multiply the two polynomials, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient from the first part times the entire second polynomial. But that would make the coefficient a polynomial, which is not a single number, so that can't be. Therefore, the problem must be asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. \n\nLet me check my steps again:\n\n1. Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem: the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6.\n\n2. Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem: the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero is when \\(k = 3\\), giving \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n\n3. Multiply these two coefficients: 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, considering the \\(c\\) terms cancel out, is 120.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not missing anything. Let me consider the entire expansion. The product is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, for the term \\(a^2b^2\\), it's multiplied by each term in the second expansion, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) where \\(k\\) ranges from -6 to 6 in steps of 2. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is actually a polynomial in \\(c\\), which would be 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that's not a single coefficient; it's an expression. Therefore, the problem must be asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120, as I found earlier.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. But in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial, not a single number. Therefore, the only way the coefficient is a single number is if we're considering the term where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out, i.e., \\(c^0\\), making the coefficient 120.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So, the answer should be 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then finding the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20. Multiplying these gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\boxed{120}."
