Since we're multiplying these two expressions together, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplies each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But we're only interested in the terms where the product results in \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by \\(c^0\\), which is the constant term. So, yes, the coefficient would indeed be 6 times 20, which is 120. Hmm, but wait, is there another way to think about this? Let me consider the entire expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). When you expand this, each term will be of the form \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}a^{4 - k}b^k \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - m}(1/c)^m\\). So, each term is \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}\\dbinom{6}{m} a^{4 - k}b^k c^{6 - 2m}\\). Now, we're looking for the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present, so \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). So, that gives us \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\) as before. Now, for the \\(c\\) term, we want the exponent to be 0, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which gives \\(m = 3\\), as before.

    "text": " So, \\((a + b)^4\\) gives 6 for \\(a^2b^2\\), and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) gives 20 for \\(c^0\\). So, when I multiply the two expressions together, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplies each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part will multiply the constant term from the second part, which is 20. So, yes, 6 times 20 is 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't miss anything. Is there a possibility that other terms in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) could contribute to the \\(a^2b^2\\) term? For example, if I take a term with \\(c^1\\) and multiply it by a term with \\(c^{-1}\\), would that contribute to \\(a^2b^2\\)? But no, because \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't have any \\(c\\) terms, so only the constant term (c^0) when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\) will result in a term that has \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms. Any other terms from the second polynomial would introduce a \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\) factor, which would make the term have \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), so they wouldn't contribute to the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. So, I think I'm correct in only considering the constant term from the second polynomial. Therefore, the coefficient is indeed 120.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of it another way. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the expansion would be a product of two polynomials. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), we can treat the \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) part as a single term when looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). But actually, no, because when you multiply polynomials, each term from the first polynomial is multiplied by each term from the second. So, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term comes from the product of the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in \\((a + b)^4\\) and the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, that reinforces my previous conclusion that the coefficient is 6 times 20, which is 120.\n\nWait, but let me also check the calculation for \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\) again. 6 choose 3 is 20, right? Because 6! is 720, 3! is 6, so 720/(6*6) = 720/36 = 20. Yep, that's correct.\n\nAnd \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) is 6, since 4! is 24, 2! is 2, so 24/(2*2) = 6. That's correct too.\n\nSo, 6 times 20 is 120. Therefore, the coefficient is 120.\n\nWait, but let me consider if the problem is written correctly. It says \\((a + b)^4 (c + 1/c)^6\\). So, it's the product of two separate binomials, each raised to a power. So, when you multiply them, each term in the first expansion multiplies each term in the second expansion. But since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), the only way to get that term is to take the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part and the constant term from the second part. So, that seems right.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think about the entire expression as a product and see if there's another way to get \\(a^2b^2\\). But no, because any other term from the second polynomial would involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), so they wouldn't contribute to the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. So, yeah, I think 120 is the correct coefficient.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, maybe I can think of it as the product of the two expansions. So, \\((a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\), and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = c^6 + 6c^5 \\times (1/c) + 15c^4 \\times (1/c)^2 + 20c^3 \\times (1/c)^3 + 15c^2 \\times (1/c)^4 + 6c \\times (1/c)^5 + (1/c)^6\\). Simplifying that, it becomes \\(c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15c^{-2} + 6c^{-4} + c^{-6}\\). So, the constant term is 20, as I found earlier. So, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. But only the constant term (20) will result in a term that's just \\(a^2b^2\\), because multiplying by any other term would introduce a \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\) factor. So, that confirms that the coefficient is 6 times 20, which is 120.\n\nI think I'm confident now that the coefficient is 120. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning, so I'll go with that.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression is found by considering the contributions from each part of the product. \n\n1. **From \\((a + b)^4\\)**:\n   - The term \\(a^2b^2\\) has a coefficient of \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n\n2. **From \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)**:\n   - The constant term (coefficient of \\(c^0\\)) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n\nMultiplying these coefficients gives the final result: \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}."
