The coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, that term is 20. Therefore, when we multiply the two expansions, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 * 20 = 120.

    "text": " If I have \\((a + b)^4\\) giving a term \\(6a^2b^2\\) and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) giving a term \\(20c^0\\), then when I multiply these two, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will be \\(6 \\times 20 a^2b^2c^0\\), which is \\(120a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient is indeed 120. Let me just make sure I didn't make any calculation errors. \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) is definitely 6 because 4 choose 2 is 6. And \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\) is 20 because 6 choose 3 is 20. Multiplying them together gives 120, which seems correct.

    "text": " If I have \\((a + b)^4\\) contributing 6 for \\(a^2b^2\\) and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) contributing 20 for \\(c^0\\), then when I multiply these two polynomials, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, and the second polynomial's \\(c^0\\) term is the only one that doesn't introduce any \\(c\\) terms, the coefficient will indeed be 6 * 20 = 120. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the binomial coefficients. For \\((a + b)^4\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is when \\(k = 2\\), so \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\), that's correct. For \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term where \\(c^0\\) is when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), so \\(m = 3\\), and \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\), that's also correct. So, 6 * 20 = 120.

    "text": " If I have \\((a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\), so yes, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. Then, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) when expanded will have a term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, which is when \\(m = 3\\), giving the coefficient 20. So, when you multiply these two expansions together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will multiply the constant term from the second part, resulting in \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\) as the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient we're looking for is 120. Wait, let me make sure I didn't miss anything. Is there any other term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) that could contribute to the \\(a^2b^2\\) term when multiplied by \\((a + b)^4\\)? No, because any term with \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\) would introduce a \\(c\\) term into the product, but \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't have any \\(c\\) terms. So, only the constant term from the second expansion will affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, I think 120 is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.
