So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is indeed 6a\u00b2b\u00b2. The term c\u2070 in the other expansion is 20, so when you multiply 6a\u00b2b\u00b2 by 20, you get 120a\u00b2b\u00b2. So, the coefficient is 120. Is there any other term that could contribute to a\u00b2b\u00b2? Let me think. If I take a term from \\((a + b)^4\\) that's not a\u00b2b\u00b2, like a\u00b3b or ab\u00b3, and then multiply it by a term from the c expansion, would that somehow result in a\u00b2b\u00b2? No, because the c terms would still be present. For example, if I take a\u00b3b and multiply it by c, I get a\u00b3bc, which isn't a\u00b2b\u00b2. Similarly, taking ab\u00b3 and multiplying by 1/c would give ab\u00b3/c, which also isn't a\u00b2b\u00b2.

Since when you multiply these two, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), it must be multiplied by the constant term in the second polynomial. So, yes, the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120. Hmm, that seems right. Alternatively, I can think of the entire expression as the product of two polynomials, and the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will only come from multiplying the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first polynomial by the constant term in the second polynomial. So, yes, 6 * 20 = 120. So, I think that's the correct coefficient. Let me see if I made any mistakes in my reasoning. First, I correctly identified that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. Then, I correctly determined that to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, I need to multiply it by the constant term in the second polynomial, which is 20. Multiplying 6 and 20 gives 120. So, I think that's correct.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to consider that the entire expression is the product of two independent expansions. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) would be 6 * 20 = 120, but since we're only interested in \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), but wait, no, actually, when you multiply the two polynomials, each term from the first is multiplied by each term from the second. So, \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first polynomial can be multiplied by any term from the second polynomial. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), it must be that the term from the second polynomial is the constant term. Otherwise, the product would have a \\(c\\) term, which would make it not \\(a^2b^2\\). So, that's why we only take the constant term from the second polynomial. Therefore, the coefficient is indeed 120.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't miss anything. Suppose I didn't consider the constant term, but instead thought that maybe higher or lower powers of \\(c\\) could contribute somehow. But no, because \\(a^2b^2\\) is independent of \\(c\\), so any term from the second polynomial that's multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\) must have \\(c^0\\) to not affect the power of \\(c\\). So, yes, only the constant term contributes to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, I think my answer is correct.\n\nJust to recap:\n\n1.

Expand \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\), which is 20.\n3. Multiply these two coefficients together: 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is 120.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Is there another way this could be approached? Maybe by considering generating functions or multinomial coefficients? Hmm, but I think the way I did it is correct. The key is that when you have two separate variables or sets of variables, the terms only combine when the exponents match. So, in this case, since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second polynomial. So, yes, that makes sense.\n\nAlternatively, if I were to write out the entire expansion, it would be the sum over all possible combinations of terms from each polynomial. But since we're only interested in \\(a^2b^2\\), we can ignore all terms in the second polynomial except the constant term. Therefore, the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120. I think that's solid.\n\nWait, just to make sure, let me compute \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) again. 4 choose 2 is (4*3)/(2*1) = 6. Correct. And 6 choose 3 is (6*5*4)/(3*2*1) = 20. Correct.

When you multiply these two, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part will be multiplied by every term in the second part, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), and so on, down to \\(a^2b^2c^{-6}\\). However, the problem is asking only for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would be the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. So, that term comes from multiplying \\(a^2b^2\\) by the constant term \\(c^0\\) in the second part. Therefore, the coefficient is indeed 6 times 20, which is 120. I think that makes sense.

So, when you multiply these two together, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term is multiplied by 20, giving \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\) as the coefficient. Hmm, that seems right. But wait, let me think again. Is there any other way the \\(a^2b^2\\) term could come up? For example, if we had cross terms or something? Wait, no, because the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are in one part of the product, and the \\(c\\) terms are in another part. So, when you multiply them, the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) is by taking \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part and \\(c^0\\) from the second part. So, yeah, that should be the only contribution. So, 6 times 20 is 120. Hmm, okay, that seems correct. Let me think if I made any mistakes. So, the first part: \\((a + b)^4\\), coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6.

So, that would be 6 * 20 = 120. Yeah, that makes sense. So, I think the coefficient is 120. Wait, but just to be thorough, let me write out the expansions a bit more. For \\((a + b)^4\\), the expansion is \\(a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6.

So, when you multiply the two expansions together, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), we need to see which terms in the second expansion, when multiplied by \\(6a^2b^2\\), result in a term that still has \\(a^2b^2\\). But wait, the second expansion only has terms with \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), so when you multiply \\(6a^2b^2\\) by, say, \\(c^6\\), you get \\(6a^2b^2c^6\\), which isn't \\(a^2b^2\\). Similarly, multiplying by \\(c^4\\) gives \\(6a^2b^2c^4\\), which also isn't \\(a^2b^2\\). The only term that doesn't introduce a \\(c\\) term is the constant term, which is 20. So, \\(6a^2b^2 \\times 20 = 120a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120. That seems consistent. I think that's the right answer.
