But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I think that part is independent of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). Wait, actually, no. Because when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first polynomial gets multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), we can consider that term in the first part and then multiply it by the entire second part, because the second part doesn't affect the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\).

So, actually, when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the expansion of the first is multiplied by each term in the expansion of the second. But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\), maybe I can just find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and then note that it gets multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. Wait, no, that's not right. Because when you multiply, the terms from the first part are multiplied by terms from the second part, so each term in the product will be a combination of a term from the first and a term from the second. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\), that means that in the product, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part is multiplied by every term in the second part. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients in the second part. Wait, that makes sense because when you multiply \\(6a^2b^2\\) by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will be present in each of those products, each multiplied by a different power of \\(c\\). But since the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), we can think of it as \\(6a^2b^2\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, to find that, I need to compute the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The sum of the coefficients in a polynomial is found by setting all variables to 1. So, substituting \\(c = 1\\), we get \\(\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = (2)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). Wait, but let me double-check that. Alternatively, I could think of it as the product of the two expansions. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the first part, and since the second part is multiplied by it, the coefficient would be the product of the coefficients from each part. But since the second part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which when expanded, each term has a coefficient, but since we're multiplying by \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), the entire coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all coefficients from the second part, which is 64.

So, I need to consider how that affects the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Hmm, actually, since \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) are separate variables from \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), the terms involving \\(c\\) won't affect the powers of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\).

So, does that mean I just need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and that's the final coefficient in the entire expression? Wait, no, that doesn't sound right. Because when you multiply two expressions, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which includes various powers of \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so perhaps it's considering all possible terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. But wait, that would mean that the coefficient is actually the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the entire expansion of the second part. But that can't be, because then the coefficient would be 6 times something, but I'm not sure. Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, if I expand both parts separately, the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) will have terms like \\(a^4\\), \\(a^3b\\), \\(a^2b^2\\), etc., each multiplied by coefficients. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) will have terms involving \\(c^6\\), \\(c^5 \\times \\dfrac{1}{c}\\), and so on, each with their own coefficients. When I multiply these two expansions together, each term in the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part will be multiplied by every term in the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, you're effectively scaling \\(a^2b^2\\) by each coefficient in the second expansion. Wait, but that doesn't seem right because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not considering any \\(c\\) terms. So, perhaps the \\(c\\) terms don't affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), because \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be the coefficient from the first expansion, which is 6, multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. But that would mean the coefficient is 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which doesn't make sense because the coefficient should be a numerical value, not an expression involving \\(c\\). Hmm, I'm confused. Maybe I need to clarify what exactly is being asked. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression. That means, when you expand the entire product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), what is the coefficient for the term \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, that term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by various powers of \\(c\\), but the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) as a standalone term (without considering \\(c\\)) would just be the coefficient from the first part, because the second part doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. Wait, but that can't be right because when you multiply, the coefficients do combine. Let me think again. Let's denote the first expansion as \\(E1 = (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^4 \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\\), and the second expansion as \\(E2 = \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^6 \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^6 \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). Now, when we multiply E1 and E2, each term in E1 is multiplied by each term in E2. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in E1, which is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\\), will be multiplied by each term in E2. So, in the product, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each \\(c^{6 - 2m}\\) term, resulting in terms like \\(6a^2b^2c^{6 - 2m}\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, in the entire product, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is actually the sum of all coefficients from E2 multiplied by 6. Because when you have \\(6a^2b^2 \\times \\sum_{m=0}^6 \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in E2. Wait, but the sum of the coefficients in E2 is when you set \\(c = 1\\). So, the sum of the coefficients in E2 is \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 * 64 = 384. Hmm, that seems plausible. Let me check that again. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in E1 is 6. The sum of all coefficients in E2 is 64. When you multiply E1 and E2, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 * 64 = 384. So, is that the answer? Wait, but I'm not sure if that's correct. Because when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term is the sum of the products of coefficients of terms whose exponents add up to that term. But in this case, since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient would be the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in E1 and the sum of all coefficients in E2. Because every term in E2 is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), so the total contribution to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the sum of coefficients in E2. Alternatively, if you think about it, when you multiply E1 and E2, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by every term in E2, so the coefficient becomes 6 times (sum of coefficients in E2). Since the sum of coefficients in E2 is 64, then 6 * 64 = 384. So, that seems correct. Alternatively, let's think about it another way. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). If we treat \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) separately from \\(c\\), then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is determined only by the part involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), which is \\((a + b)^4\\), and the rest of the expression, which is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), contributes a factor that scales the coefficient. Since \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) expands to terms involving different powers of \\(c\\), but when considering the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), we're effectively summing over all possible terms in E2, which is equivalent to evaluating E2 at \\(c = 1\\), giving 64. Therefore, the coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384. So, I think that's the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) can be found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplying it by the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is \\(2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n\\boxed{384}"

So, I think I need to consider the expansion of both parts and then multiply them together. But since we are only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), maybe I can focus on that part without expanding the entire expression. Wait, but the other part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).

Wait, maybe I'm wrong here. Let me try a different approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the variables \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) don't affect the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) at all because they are separate variables. So, when we multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is 6 times something. Wait, but that doesn't seem right because when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficients of the terms in one polynomial affect the coefficients of the terms in the other polynomial when combining like terms. But in this case, \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), so any term from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\) would result in a term that includes \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), except when the term from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is a constant term. Wait, but \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) doesn't have a constant term because all terms will have either positive or negative exponents of \\(c\\). So, does that mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is zero? That can't be right because we have \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), and when multiplied by any term from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), it would still be a term with \\(a^2b^2\\) times something involving \\(c\\). So, perhaps there is no constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which would mean that when you multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), the resulting term would have \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some \\(k\\), but since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is without any \\(c\\) terms, maybe the coefficient is zero. But that seems odd because the problem is asking for it, so perhaps I'm misunderstanding something.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm making a mistake here. Let me clarify: The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, if we expand this product, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, for example, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), etc., but none of these are just \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be zero because there are no terms that are exactly \\(a^2b^2\\); every term involving \\(a^2b^2\\) would also have some power of \\(c\\). Hmm, but that seems contradictory because the problem is asking for the coefficient, implying that it's not zero. Maybe I'm missing something here.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating the problem. Let me re-examine the original question: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, actually, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). Wait, no, that can't be right because in the product, each term would have both \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) parts and \\(c\\) parts. So, perhaps the problem is miswritten, or maybe I'm misunderstanding it. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, considering all possible powers of \\(c\\). But that doesn't make much sense because the coefficient would then be the product of the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) and the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that would make the coefficient a polynomial in \\(c\\), which isn't a number. So, perhaps the problem is intended to have us consider only the terms where \\(c\\) cancels out, but that would require the exponent of \\(c\\) to be zero, i.e., the term where the exponent is zero in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, perhaps the coefficient is 6 times the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). That might make sense.\n\nLet me check that approach. So, first, find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, as I found earlier. Then, find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). The constant term would be the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. So, using the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(1/c\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We want the exponent of \\(c\\) to be zero, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which gives \\(m = 3\\). So, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times 20, which is 120. \n\nWait, that seems plausible. So, putting it all together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 6 times 20, which is 120. So, the final answer is 120.\n\nBut let me verify this again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. So, \\((a + b)^4\\) expanded has \\(a^2b^2\\) with coefficient 6. Then, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) has a constant term when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, which occurs when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), so \\(m = 3\\). The coefficient there is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, when we multiply the two expansions, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by the constant term 20 from the second part, resulting in \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is indeed 120. \n\nI think that makes sense. So, the answer is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplying it by the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20.

Wait, no, that doesn't make sense because the second part is raised to the 6th power. Let me think again.\n\nWait, no, actually, when you multiply two expressions, each term in the first expression is multiplied by each term in the second expression. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), we can treat the second part as a constant with respect to \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't seem right because the problem is asking for the coefficient, not the entire expression. Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me try to break it down differently.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider that the two parts are multiplied together, so the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are in the first part, while \\(c\\) is in the second part, the \\(c\\) terms won't affect the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the entire second part, which is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is 6 times something, but that something includes \\(c\\) terms, so maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) because if we're considering all variables together, but the problem didn't specify any \\(c\\) terms. Hmm, that might be it. So, maybe I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). But that doesn't make sense because the expression includes \\(c\\) terms. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, so the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), not a single number. Wait, but the problem is phrased as \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", so maybe it's considering all possible terms in the product, and the coefficient would include the terms from the second expansion.\n\nWait, no, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think again: the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are only in the first part, and \\(c\\) is only in the second, when you multiply them, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by every term in the second expansion. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would include all the coefficients from the second expansion. So, the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that can't be right because the coefficient should be a number, not an expression involving \\(c\\). So, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is only considering the terms where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out, i.e., \\(c^0\\), so that the term is a constant. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire product. That would make sense because then the coefficient would be a number. So, maybe I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\) in the product.\n\nSo, let me approach it that way. First, find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, as I found earlier. Then, find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Then, multiply those two coefficients together to get the final coefficient for \\(a^2b^2c^0\\).\n\nOkay, so let's find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Again, using the binomial theorem, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(1/c\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\).\n\nWe need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\).\n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part is 20. Now, the total coefficient for \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire product is the product of the coefficients from each part, which is 6 times 20, so 120.\n\nWait, but let me double-check that. So, the first part gives 6 for \\(a^2b^2\\), and the second part gives 20 for \\(c^0\\). When you multiply these together, you get 6 * 20 = 120. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, considering only the constant term in \\(c\\), is 120.\n\nWait, but does the problem specify that we're looking for \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), or specifically \\(a^2b^2c^0\\)? The problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", which might imply that we're considering the term \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by any power of \\(c\\). But that doesn't make much sense because the coefficient would then be a polynomial in \\(c\\), not a single number. So, perhaps the intended interpretation is that we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the constant term with respect to \\(c\\). That seems more reasonable.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, ignoring the second part. But that would be 6, which seems too simple, and the problem includes the second part, so I think the intended answer is 120.\n\nLet me recap: The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 20. Multiplying them together gives 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120.\n\nI think that makes sense. So, the final answer should be 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is found using the binomial coefficient \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). For the term \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying these gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\boxed{120}"

    "text": " So, the coefficient is 6. But wait, the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Hmm, does that affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)? Let me think. Since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are variables separate from \\(c\\), when we multiply the two expressions together, the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) will be multiplied by terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would just be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), it's just 6 times whatever the entire second part evaluates to, but since the second part doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), it's just a constant multiplier. Wait, no, that's not quite right. Let me clarify. When you multiply two expressions, the coefficients multiply. So, if I have \\((a + b)^4\\) times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of all the terms in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But wait, no, that can't be right because the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't make sense because the problem is probably expecting a numerical coefficient, not an expression in terms of \\(c\\). Wait, maybe I misread the problem. Let me check again: It says, \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\)?\" So, in the product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), but the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, so perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question. Alternatively, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Wait, no, that's not correct either. Let me think differently. When you multiply two expressions, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each factor. But in this case, since \\(a^2b^2\\) is in the first factor and the second factor doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the entire second factor, which is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), not a numerical coefficient. So, perhaps the problem is expecting the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times some term in \\(c\\), but the problem statement doesn't specify a particular power of \\(c\\), just \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me re-express the problem: We have two separate parts, \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). When multiplied together, each term from the first part is multiplied by each term from the second part. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term from the second part. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that seems odd because the problem is likely expecting a numerical coefficient. Alternatively, maybe I'm supposed to consider that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just 6, and the rest is separate. But that doesn't seem right either because the entire expression is a product, so the coefficients multiply. Wait, perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), so \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 * 64 = 384. Wait, that might make sense. Let me check that logic again. If I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = (2)^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of all coefficients in the second part is 64. Therefore, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by 64, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) becomes 6 * 64 = 384. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 384. Alternatively, maybe I should think of it as the coefficient being 6 times the entire expansion, but that's not a numerical coefficient. So, perhaps the correct approach is to recognize that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, and since the other part is a separate polynomial, the coefficient in the product is 6 times the sum of the coefficients of the second polynomial, which is 64, giving 384. That seems plausible. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it, and the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which is 6 times the entire second expression, but since the second expression is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the coefficient would be 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but that's not a numerical coefficient. So, perhaps the problem is expecting just the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, but that seems unlikely because the entire expression is a product. Wait, let me try to think differently. Maybe the problem is considering the entire expression as a polynomial in \\(a, b, c\\), and we're to find the coefficient of the term \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some \\(k\\), but the problem doesn't specify \\(k\\), just \\(a^2b^2\\). So, perhaps the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But that's not a numerical coefficient. So, maybe the problem is expecting the sum of all coefficients of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for any \\(k\\), which would be 6 times the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384. That seems to make sense. Let me verify that approach. The sum of coefficients in a polynomial is found by substituting all variables equal to 1. So, if I set \\(a = 1\\), \\(b = 1\\), and \\(c = 1\\), then the entire expression becomes \\((1 + 1)^4 \\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^4 * 2^6 = 16 * 64 = 1024\\). But the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would contribute 6 * 64 = 384 to this total, as calculated earlier. So, that seems consistent. Alternatively, if I think of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) as being 6, and then the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that's not a numerical coefficient; it's a polynomial. So, perhaps the problem is expecting the sum of the coefficients of \\(a^2b^2\\) across all powers of \\(c\\), which would be 6 * 64 = 384. I think that must be the intended answer. So, to summarize, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and since the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the coefficient in the product is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is found using the binomial coefficient \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). The entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). To find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, we consider that the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is obtained by setting \\(c = 1\\), yielding \\(2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{384}\\)."

    "text": " So, the coefficient is 6. \n\nBut wait, the expression isn't just \\((a + b)^4\\); it's multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I need to consider that as well. Hmm, does the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part affect the coefficient when multiplied by the second part? Let me think. The second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), is also a binomial expression, so I can expand that using the binomial theorem too. The expansion would be \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying that, each term becomes \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m} = \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). \n\nWait, but I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). That term doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), right? It's just a term in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). So, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in the expansion would be a product of a term from the first expansion and a term from the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part will be multiplied by every term in the second expansion. But since the problem only asks for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and not any terms involving \\(c\\), I think I need to consider whether the second part contributes to any \\(c\\) terms that might affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, no, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the product of the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) and the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), because when you multiply, each term from the first part is multiplied by each term from the second part. But wait, that would mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all the coefficients from the second part. Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will have coefficients multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But actually, no, because \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term without \\(c\\), so when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each of those products will have a term involving \\(c\\), but the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would actually be the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all the coefficients from the second part, because each term in the second part contributes a coefficient that gets multiplied by the coefficient from the first part. \n\nWait, let me think again. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, the coefficients add up. So, the total coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). \n\nBut wait, the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) can be found by setting \\(c = 1\\). Because when \\(c = 1\\), each term becomes its coefficient. So, substituting \\(c = 1\\), we get \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the sum of the coefficients is 64. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nWait, but that seems too straightforward. Let me check again. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), and when multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part, each term in the second part contributes a coefficient that multiplies the 6. So, the total coefficient would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, giving 384. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I should think about the entire product. The product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) can be expanded as a product of two polynomials. So, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion is a specific term, and when multiplied by each term in the second expansion, it results in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^{6 - 2m}\\) for \\(m\\) from 0 to 6. But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would be the sum of all the coefficients from the second expansion, because each term in the second expansion contributes a coefficient that multiplies the 6 from the first part. So, indeed, the coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nWait, but another way to think about it is that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, and when you multiply by the entire expansion of the second part, each term in the second expansion is a coefficient times a power of \\(c\\), so when you multiply 6 by each of those coefficients, the total coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) across all terms would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider that the second expansion doesn't affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) because \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be the coefficient from the first expansion times the entire second expansion, but since the second expansion is a polynomial in \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually be the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all the coefficients in the second part, because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, you're effectively scaling \\(a^2b^2\\) by each coefficient and then summing all those scaled terms. But since the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), it's actually the product of the coefficients from each part. Wait, no, that's not quite right because \\(a^2b^2\\) is a single term, and when you multiply it by each term in the second expansion, each product would have a term like \\(a^2b^2c^{k}\\), but the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not any specific power of \\(c\\). So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients from the second part, because each term in the second part contributes a coefficient that gets multiplied by 6, and then when you collect all the terms that have \\(a^2b^2\\), their coefficients would add up to 6 times the sum of the coefficients from the second part. \n\nSo, to calculate that, I can find the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nWait, but let me check if that's correct. Alternatively, maybe I should think of it as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6, and the coefficient of any term in the second part is whatever it is, but when you multiply, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second part, because each term in the second part adds to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, yes, that makes sense. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can approach it differently. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 times 64, as before. So, 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. Let me think about a simpler case. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^1 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, expanding, it's \\((a + b)(c + 1/c)\\). The coefficient of \\(a\\) in this product would be the coefficient of \\(a\\) in the first part times the sum of coefficients in the second part. The coefficient of \\(a\\) in \\((a + b)\\) is 1, and the sum of coefficients in \\((c + 1/c)\\) is \\(1 + 1 = 2\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a\\) in the product would be 1 * 2 = 2. Let's check: expanding \\((a + b)(c + 1/c)\\) gives \\(ac + a/c + bc + b/c\\). The terms with \\(a\\) are \\(ac\\) and \\(a/c\\), each with coefficient 1, so the total coefficient for \\(a\\) is 1 + 1 = 2, which matches. So, in this case, the approach works. Similarly, if I take \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^2\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) would be \\(\\dbinom{2}{2} = 1\\) times the sum of coefficients in \\((c + 1/c)^2\\), which is \\((1 + 1)^2 = 4\\), so 1 * 4 = 4. Let's check: \\((a + b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2\\), and \\((c + 1/c)^2 = c^2 + 2 + 1/c^2\\). Multiplying, the term \\(a^2\\) would be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, giving \\(a^2c^2 + 2a^2 + a^2/c^2\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) is 1 (from \\(a^2c^2\\)) + 2 (from \\(2a^2\\)) + 1 (from \\(a^2/c^2\\)), totaling 4, which matches. So, this approach seems correct. \n\nTherefore, applying this to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times 64, which is 384. \n\nWait, but let me think again. Alternatively, perhaps I'm misapplying the concept. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but in the entire product, \\(a^2b^2\\) is just a single term without any \\(c\\) terms. So, when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second part, each of which has a coefficient. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all coefficients from the second part, which is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nAlternatively, if I were to write out the entire expansion, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would indeed be 6 multiplied by each term in the second expansion, but since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), it's the sum of all those contributions, which is 6 * 64. \n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because sometimes when you have multiple variables, the coefficients can be affected differently, but in this case, since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), their coefficients aren't influenced by the \\(c\\) terms. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be the product of the coefficients from each part. \n\nWait, no, that's not exactly right because the second part isn't a constant; it's a polynomial in \\(c\\). So, when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, you get terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), each with their own coefficients. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in effect, it's asking for the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion, each multiplied by 6, because each term in the second expansion contributes a coefficient that gets multiplied by 6. Therefore, the total coefficient is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nI think that makes sense. Let me just confirm with another example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). The coefficient of \\(a^2\\) in \\((a + b)^2\\) is 1. The sum of coefficients in \\((c + 1/c)\\) is 2. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) in the product should be 1 * 2 = 2. Let's check: \\((a + b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2\\). Multiply by \\((c + 1/c)\\): \\(a^2c + a^2/c + 2abc + 2ab/c + b^2c + b^2/c\\). The coefficient of \\(a^2\\) is 1 (from \\(a^2c\\)) + 1 (from \\(a^2/c\\)) = 2, which matches. So, the approach works here too. \n\nTherefore, applying the same logic, in the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not missing anything. The problem is \\((a + b)^4 \\times (c + 1/c)^6\\). The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, and the coefficient of any term in the second part is part of the expansion. So, when you multiply, each term in the second expansion contributes a coefficient that scales the 6, and since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), it's the sum of all those scaled coefficients, which is 6 * sum of coefficients in the second part. \n\nYes, I think that's correct. So, the final answer is 384.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break down the problem into two parts using the binomial theorem.\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\):**\n   Using the binomial theorem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is given by \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n\n2. **Sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   The sum of the coefficients is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), resulting in \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\).\n\n3. **Combine the results:**\n   Multiply the coefficient from the first part by the sum of the coefficients from the second part: \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n**Answer:** \\(\\boxed{384}\\)"

    "text": " So, the coefficient is 6. \n\nNow, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). That means I don't need to worry about the \\(c\\) terms because they won't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. So, maybe I can just consider the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) separately and then multiply it by the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), perhaps the other terms involving \\(c\\) won't matter. Wait, but actually, when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first polynomial gets multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), that would come from the product of the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in \\((a + b)^4\\) and the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because any other term involving \\(c\\) would introduce a \\(c\\) term, which would make the product have a \\(c\\) component, but the problem is only asking for \\(a^2b^2\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and the constant term in the second part. \n\nWait, is that right? Let me think again. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, when you expand this, each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second part. But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term without any \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), that would only come from the product of \\(a^2b^2\\) and the constant term (the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero) in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) and then multiply it by 6 (the coefficient from \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part). \n\nOkay, so let's work on finding the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Again, using the binomial theorem, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(1/c\\right)^m\\). Simplifying each term, that becomes \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\times c^{-m} = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, each term has an exponent of \\(c\\) equal to \\(6 - 2m\\). We need the term where the exponent is zero because that's the constant term. So, set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). So, the constant term is when \\(m = 3\\). The coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\), which is \\(\\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). \n\nSo, the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 20. Now, going back to the original expression, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the constant term in the second part is 20. Therefore, when we multiply these together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nWait, let me double-check that. So, the coefficient from the first part is 6, and the constant term from the second part is 20, so 6*20 is indeed 120. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120. \n\nBut just to be thorough, let me consider if there's any other way this could be affected. For example, if there were cross terms where \\(c\\) terms multiplied with \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms, but since we're only looking for the term that has \\(a^2b^2\\), any term that includes \\(c\\) would not contribute to that specific term. So, only the constant term in the second part would affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). \n\nSo, I think that makes sense. So, the coefficient is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is found using the binomial coefficient \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). The constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by setting the exponent of \\(c\\) to zero, which occurs at \\(m = 3\\), giving the coefficient \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying these together gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\boxed{120}."

    "text": " So, the coefficient from the first part is 6.\n\nNow, the second part of the expression is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I'm a bit confused because the problem is asking about \\(a^2b^2\\), but this part involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). Wait, does this part affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)? Hmm, I think it does because the entire expression is the product of \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when we multiply these two expansions, each term from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term from the second expansion. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term in the first part, maybe the second part doesn't affect it? Wait, no, that can't be right because when you multiply the two expressions, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. But \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), so when we multiply it by any term from the second expression, it would have to involve \\(c^0\\) to stay as \\(a^2b^2\\). So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part. So, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nLet me work on that. The expression is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Again, using the binomial theorem, this is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying that, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m} = \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We want the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\).\n\nSo, now I have the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part as 6 and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part as 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Wait, does that make sense? Let me check again. When you multiply the two expressions, each term from \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by every term in the second part. But only the term with \\(c^0\\) in the second part will result in a term that is just \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\). So, yes, the coefficient is 6 * 20, which is 120.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't miss anything. Is there a possibility that other terms from the second expansion could contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)? For example, if there's a term like \\(c^1\\) and another term like \\(c^{-1}\\), would multiplying them give \\(c^0\\)? But in the product, each term is a product of a term from the first expansion and a term from the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is only multiplied by terms from the second expansion, which are all in the form of \\(c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the only way to get \\(c^0\\) is when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which is when \\(m = 3\\), as I found earlier. So, that's the only term contributing to the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. Therefore, the coefficient is indeed 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Is the entire expression \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, when I expand this, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is present in \\((a + b)^4\\) with coefficient 6, and in the second part, the term \\(c^0\\) is present with coefficient 20. So, when you multiply these two, you get \\(6 \\times 20 \\times a^2b^2c^0\\), which is \\(120a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient is 120.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because the original expression has both \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) and \\(c\\). So, does that mean that \\(a^2b^2\\) is independent of \\(c\\), so the coefficient is just 6 times 20? Or is there another way to approach this problem?\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider the entire expansion as a product of two separate expansions and find the coefficient accordingly. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the product of the coefficients of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part, as I thought before. So, yes, 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but let me think if there's any other term that could contribute to \\(a^2b^2\\). For example, if in the second expansion, there are terms with \\(c^1\\) and \\(c^{-1}\\), but when multiplied together, they give \\(c^0\\). But in the product, each term from the first expansion is multiplied by each term from the second expansion. So, if I take \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part and multiply it by \\(c^1\\) from the second part, I get \\(a^2b^2c^1\\), which is a different term, not \\(a^2b^2\\). Similarly, multiplying by \\(c^{-1}\\) gives \\(a^2b^2c^{-1}\\), which is also different. So, only the term where the second part is \\(c^0\\) will result in the term \\(a^2b^2\\). So, I think my earlier conclusion is correct.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me compute both expansions separately and see.\n\nFirst, \\((a + b)^4\\): The expansion is \\(a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6.\n\nNext, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\): The expansion is \\(c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15c^{-2} + 6c^{-4} + c^{-6}\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20.\n\nNow, when we multiply these two expansions together, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. The only term in the second expansion that doesn't involve \\(c\\) is the constant term 20. So, multiplying \\(6a^2b^2\\) by 20 gives \\(120a^2b^2\\). All other terms from the second expansion will introduce a power of \\(c\\), so they won't contribute to the \\(a^2b^2\\) term.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120.\n\nWait, but just to be thorough, let me consider the entire product. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, when you expand this, each term will be of the form \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}a^{4 - k}b^k \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) occurs when \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\), as we saw before. So, the coefficient from the first part is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Then, for the second part, we need \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which gives \\(m = 3\\), so the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, the combined coefficient is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nYes, that seems correct. I think I've double-checked it enough times. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem for both parts of the expression.\n\n1. **Expanding \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\):\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\n   \\]\n   So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\n2. **Expanding \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n   \\]\n   We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0:\n   \\[\n   6 - 2m = 0 \\implies m = 3\n   \\]\n   The coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\n   \\]\n\n3. **Combining the results:**\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficients from the two parts:\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 20 = 120\n   \\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}."

Wait, no, that doesn't make sense because \\(a^2b^2\\) is only from the first part, and when multiplied by the second part, it would be \\(a^2b^2\\) times each term in the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would just be the coefficient from the first part, 6, multiplied by the entire second part. Wait, but that can't be right because the second part isn't a single term; it's a sum of terms. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But wait, that's not correct either because each term in the second expansion would multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term, so the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 multiplied by each term in the second expansion, but the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would actually be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in the second expansion. Wait, no, that's not quite right. Let me think again. When you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum of the products of the coefficients of terms that multiply together to give that specific term. In this case, since \\(a^2b^2\\) is only from the first part, and the second part is in terms of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), which don't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in the second expansion. But actually, the second expansion is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), and each term in this expansion is of the form \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} (1/c)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, each term in the second expansion is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\), where \\(k\\) goes from 0 to 6. Now, when you multiply this by \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term from the first expansion, you get terms like \\(6 \\times \\dbinom{6}{k} a^2b^2 c^{6 - 2k}\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in the second expansion. Wait, but the sum of all the coefficients in the second expansion is obtained by setting \\(c = 1\\), because that would make each term just the coefficient times \\(1\\). So, \\(\\left(1 + 1/1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times 64, which is 384. But wait, that seems too straightforward. Let me check again. Alternatively, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without considering the \\(c\\) terms, meaning that the coefficient is 6, and the rest is multiplied by \\(c\\) terms. But that doesn't seem right because the entire expression is a product, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, giving 384. But let me think differently. Maybe I'm overcomplicating it. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product. So, in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the first part, and when multiplied by the second part, it will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Since the sum of coefficients in the second part is when \\(c = 1\\), which is \\(2^6 = 64\\), so the total coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384. But wait, is that correct? Alternatively, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, so it's 6 times the entire second expansion, but that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. Therefore, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by any power of \\(c\\), so the coefficient would be 6 times the entire second expansion, but that would make the coefficient a sum involving \\(c\\), which isn't a number. Therefore, perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, but the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would have a coefficient that includes the entire second expansion. But that doesn't seem right because the problem is asking for a coefficient, which is a number, not an expression. Therefore, maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some specific \\(k\\), but the problem statement just says \\(a^2b^2\\), so perhaps it's considering all terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. But that would mean the coefficient is 6 times the entire second expansion, which would be a sum of terms, not a single coefficient. Therefore, perhaps the problem is misworded, and it's actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) times the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), meaning that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), treating the entire second part as a constant, which would be incorrect. Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it, and the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and the second part is irrelevant because it's multiplied by terms in \\(c\\). But that seems unlikely because the problem includes both parts. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, meaning that it's the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the entire second expansion. But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, which doesn't make sense. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, meaning that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, so 384. But let me think again. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, meaning that it's 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, because each term in the second expansion is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. So, I think that's the correct approach. Let me verify. The expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) gives \\(a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^6 \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). The sum of all coefficients is obtained by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\(2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 * 64 = 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.

Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n\\(\\boxed{384}\\)"

    "text": " So, the coefficient is 6.\n\nWait a second, but the original expression is \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I think I need to consider the entire expression. But the term we're looking for is \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\). That means, in the product, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will come from the term in \\((a + b)^4\\) that is \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by any term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) must be 1. Wait, no, that might not be correct. Let me think again.\n\nActually, when you multiply two expressions together, each term from the first expression is multiplied by each term from the second expression. But since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that only has \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and no \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), that means the term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) must be the constant term, i.e., the term where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out, so that when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), it doesn't introduce any \\(c\\) terms. So, I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), and then multiply it by the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) from \\((a + b)^4\\), which we found to be 6.\n\nSo, first, let's find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Again, I can use the binomial theorem for this. The expansion is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be zero for the term to be constant. So, set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} c^{0} = \\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\).\n\nSo, the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Now, going back to the original expression, \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from multiplying \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part by the constant term 20 from the second part. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 (from the first expansion) multiplied by 20 (from the second expansion). So, 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. Is there any other term that could contribute to \\(a^2b^2\\) when multiplied by a term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)? For example, if there was a term in \\((a + b)^4\\) with different exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and a term in the other expansion that could combine to give \\(a^2b^2\\). But actually, since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a specific term, and the other expansion only contributes a scalar multiple (the constant term) when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), there's no other combination. So, the only contribution comes from multiplying the \\(a^2b^2\\) term by the constant term 20. Therefore, the coefficient is indeed 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me think again. If I have \\((a + b)^4\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6a^2b^2. Then, when I multiply by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which has a constant term 20, so when I multiply 6a^2b^2 by 20, I get 120a^2b^2. So yes, the coefficient is 120. I think that's correct. I don't see any mistakes in the reasoning.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we first determine the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem, which is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Next, we find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which occurs when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. This term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying these coefficients together gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\boxed{120}."

    "text": " So, the coefficient is 6. \n\nNow, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, so I think that the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), doesn't affect the coefficients of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), because it's only involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, when I multiply the two expressions together, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part will be multiplied by every term from the second part. But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I think the \\(c\\) terms won't affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, maybe I just need to consider the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, and that's it. \n\nWait, but let me make sure. Let me think again. So, when I multiply two polynomials, each term in the first polynomial gets multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. So, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first part is 6a\u00b2b\u00b2, and then when I multiply it by the second part, which is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in that expansion will be multiplied by 6a\u00b2b\u00b2. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 times whatever the sum of the coefficients in the second part is, because when you multiply 6a\u00b2b\u00b2 by each term in the second expansion, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^k\\) in the second part. But wait, the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. \n\nWait, no, actually, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but it's in the entire expression. So, maybe I'm supposed to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times any power of \\(c\\). So, perhaps I need to consider that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, and when multiplied by the entire second part, which is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. But wait, the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion would be when \\(c = 1\\), so substituting \\(c = 1\\), we get \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, would the coefficient be 6 times 64, which is 384? But wait, that seems too high. Let me think again.\n\nWait, no, that's not correct. Because when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which is 64. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times any power of \\(c\\) would be 6 * 64 = 384. But wait, the problem just asks for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so maybe it's considering all possible terms, so the total coefficient is 384. But wait, let me check if that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), so the coefficient would indeed be 6 times the sum of the coefficients of the second part, which is 64, giving 384. But let me verify this by another approach.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can consider that the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), and when we expand this, each term is of the form \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}a^{4 - k}b^k \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - m}(1/c)^m\\), which simplifies to \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}\\dbinom{6}{m}a^{4 - k}b^k c^{6 - 2m}\\). Now, we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so we need \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). So, for each \\(m\\) from 0 to 6, the term will have \\(a^2b^2c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the coefficient for each such term would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\dbinom{6}{m}\\). So, to find the total coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), we need to sum over all possible \\(m\\) from 0 to 6, so it's \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\sum_{m=0}^{6}\\dbinom{6}{m}\\). But \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6}\\dbinom{6}{m} = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the total coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} \\times 64 = 6 \\times 64 = 384\\). So, that seems consistent.\n\nWait, but that seems like a lot. Let me check if that makes sense. Because in the first part, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, and in the second part, the sum of all coefficients is 64, so when you multiply, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times any term from the second part would be 6 * 64. So, yeah, 384.\n\nWait, but another way to think about it is that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, and when you multiply by the entire second expression, which is a polynomial in \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. So, that seems correct.\n\nWait, but let me check if I'm interpreting the problem correctly. The problem says, \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\" in the entire expression. So, that would mean that in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, yes, that would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which is 64, so 384.\n\nWait, but let me check with specific terms. Let's expand \\((a + b)^4\\) to get \\(a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6. Now, the second part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), can be expanded as \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6}\\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - m}(1/c)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6}\\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, each term in this expansion is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\), where \\(m\\) ranges from 0 to 6.\n\nNow, when I multiply the two expansions together, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part, which is 6a\u00b2b\u00b2, will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, each term will be 6a\u00b2b\u00b2 multiplied by \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\), resulting in terms like 6\\dbinom{6}{m}a\u00b2b\u00b2c^{6 - 2m}. So, the coefficient for each of these terms is 6\\dbinom{6}{m}, and the variable part is \\(a^2b^2c^{6 - 2m}\\).\n\nSince the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), we need to sum all the coefficients from each term where \\(a^2b^2\\) appears. So, that would be the sum over \\(m\\) from 0 to 6 of 6\\dbinom{6}{m}. So, that's 6 times the sum of \\dbinom{6}{m} from m=0 to 6. As I calculated earlier, the sum of \\dbinom{6}{m} from m=0 to 6 is 2^6 = 64. So, 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but another way to think about it is that when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each polynomial. But in this case, since the second polynomial doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), it's just a polynomial in \\(c\\), so when you multiply 6a\u00b2b\u00b2 by each term in the second polynomial, the coefficient for each \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) term is 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^k\\) in the second polynomial. But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), we need to sum all these coefficients across all possible \\(k\\), which is the same as multiplying 6 by the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 64, giving 384.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of it as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial. So, that's 6 * 64 = 384. So, that seems to confirm it.\n\nWait, but let me check if I'm not overcomplicating. Let me think of a simpler case. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, \\((a + b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2\\), and \\((c + 1/c)^1 = c + 1/c\\). So, the product would be \\(a^2(c + 1/c) + 2ab(c + 1/c) + b^2(c + 1/c)\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) would be 1 times (1 + 1) = 2, because the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) is 1 in the first part, and when multiplied by each term in the second part, which has coefficients 1 and 1, so 1*(1 + 1) = 2. Similarly, the coefficient of \\(ab\\) would be 2*(1 + 1) = 4, and the coefficient of \\(b^2\\) would be 1*(1 + 1) = 2.\n\nWait, so in this simpler case, the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) in the first part times the sum of coefficients in the second part. So, that's 1 * (1 + 1) = 2. Similarly, the coefficient of \\(ab\\) is 2 * 2 = 4, etc.\n\nSo, applying that logic to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6, and the sum of coefficients in the second part is 64, so the total coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, that seems consistent. So, I think that's the correct answer. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is 384.\n\nWait, but let me just confirm by another method. Let me compute the entire product step by step, but perhaps that's too time-consuming. Alternatively, I can compute the coefficient using generating functions.\n\nWait, another approach: The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, as we found. Now, when we multiply by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term, which is 6a\u00b2b\u00b2, is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, which is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, each term in the product is 6a\u00b2b\u00b2 * \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^{6 - 2m}\\) is 6\\dbinom{6}{m}. \n\nBut since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), we need to sum all the coefficients where the exponent of \\(a\\) is 2 and \\(b\\) is 2, which occurs only when \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any term from the second polynomial. So, the coefficient would be the sum over all \\(m\\) of 6\\dbinom{6}{m}, which is 6 * sum_{m=0}^6 \\dbinom{6}{m} = 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nYes, that seems consistent. So, I think the answer is 384.\n\nWait, but let me check once more with specific terms. Let's compute \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) separately and then see how the coefficients combine.\n\nFirst, \\((a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\).\n\nSecond, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) can be expanded as \\(c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15/c^2 + 6/c^4 + 1/c^6\\).\n\nNow, when we multiply these two, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first expansion is 6a\u00b2b\u00b2. When we multiply this by each term in the second expansion, we get:\n\n6a\u00b2b\u00b2 * c^6 = 6a\u00b2b\u00b2c^6,\n\n6a\u00b2b\u00b2 * 6c^4 = 36a\u00b2b\u00b2c^4,\n\n6a\u00b2b\u00b2 * 15c^2 = 90a\u00b2b\u00b2c^2,\n\n6a\u00b2b\u00b2 * 20 = 120a\u00b2b\u00b2,\n\n6a\u00b2b\u00b2 * 15/c^2 = 90a\u00b2b\u00b2/c^2,\n\n6a\u00b2b\u00b2 * 6/c^4 = 36a\u00b2b\u00b2/c^4,\n\n6a\u00b2b\u00b2 * 1/c^6 = 6a\u00b2b\u00b2/c^6.\n\nSo, each of these terms has \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by different powers of \\(c\\). Now, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, we need to sum all the coefficients of these terms. That would be:\n\n6 + 36 + 90 + 120 + 90 + 36 + 6.\n\nLet me add these up:\n\n6 + 36 = 42,\n\n42 + 90 = 132,\n\n132 + 120 = 252,\n\n252 + 90 = 342,\n\n342 + 36 = 378,\n\n378 + 6 = 384.\n\nSo, the total coefficient is 384. That matches what I calculated earlier. So, that seems to confirm that the coefficient is indeed 384.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make any arithmetic errors. Let me add the coefficients again:\n\n6 (from c^6),\n\n36 (from c^4),\n\n90 (from c^2),\n\n120 (constant term),\n\n90 (from 1/c^2),\n\n36 (from 1/c^4),\n\n6 (from 1/c^6).\n\nAdding them up:\n\n6 + 36 = 42,\n\n42 + 90 = 132,\n\n132 + 120 = 252,\n\n252 + 90 = 342,\n\n342 + 36 = 378,\n\n378 + 6 = 384.\n\nYes, that's correct. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 384.\n\nWait, but let me think if there's another way to approach this problem, maybe using multinomial coefficients or something else. Hmm, perhaps not necessary, since the binomial approach worked.\n\nAlternatively, I could think of the entire expression as a product of two independent expansions, so the coefficients multiply. But in this case, since one part involves \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) and the other involves \\(c\\), they are independent variables, so the coefficients just multiply. But wait, no, because we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which only comes from the first part, and when multiplied by the entire second part, which is a polynomial in \\(c\\), the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) times any \\(c\\) term is 6 times the coefficient in the second part. So, when summing over all possible \\(c\\) terms, it's 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, that's another way to see it. So, I think I'm confident that 384 is the correct coefficient.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{384}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem.\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\), so the coefficient is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\n   \\]\n\n2. **Consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n   \\]\n   The sum of all coefficients in this expansion is found by substituting \\(c = 1\\):\n   \\[\n   \\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\n   \\]\n\n3. **Combine the results:**\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.

So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 multiplied by the sum of the coefficients of all terms in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that might not be correct because each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is a different power of \\(c\\), so when you multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) would give a term of the form \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some exponent \\(k\\). But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so perhaps it's the sum of all coefficients from the \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) expansion, because each term's coefficient would be multiplied by 6, and then added together. Wait, but no, that might not be right. Let me clarify: The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when you expand this, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\), and it's multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then perhaps the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that might not be the case. Let me think again. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is of the form \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\\), and when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), the term becomes \\(a^2b^2 \\times \\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be the sum over all \\(k\\) of \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\dbinom{6}{k}\\), because each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) contributes its own coefficient when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, but that seems a bit confusing. Let me try to structure it properly. The overall expression is the product of two expansions: \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When you multiply these two, each term from the first expansion is multiplied by each term from the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion has a coefficient of \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\), which is 6. Now, when you multiply this by each term in the second expansion, which is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\\), the coefficient for each term \\(a^2b^2c^{6 - 2k}\\) would be \\(6 \\times \\dbinom{6}{k}\\). However, the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). That means we're looking for the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion, because each term in the second expansion, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), gives a term with \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by some power of \\(c\\), each with their own coefficient. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be \\(6 \\times\\) the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Now, the sum of all coefficients in a polynomial is found by evaluating the polynomial at \\(c = 1\\). So, let me compute \\(\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = (1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). Wait, but that seems high. Let me double-check. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), perhaps it's simply the product of the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) and the sum of all coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, 6 times 64 is indeed 384. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only considering terms where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out, meaning \\(c^0\\), so that the term is a constant. In that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me check that. The term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero occurs when \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), so \\(k = 3\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times 20, which is 120. Hmm, now I'm confused because I'm getting two different answers depending on how I interpret the problem. Let me read the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, the problem is asking for the coefficient of the term \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). That is, it's asking for all terms in the expansion where \\(a^2b^2\\) appears, multiplied by any power of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient would indeed be the sum over all terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^k\\) for any \\(k\\). So, each such term would have a coefficient of \\(6 \\times \\dbinom{6}{k}\\), and the total coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the sum of these over all \\(k\\), which is 6 times the sum of \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}\\) for \\(k = 0\\) to \\(6\\). But the sum of \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}\\) from \\(k=0\\) to \\(6\\) is \\(2^6 = 64\\), as I calculated earlier. So, 6 times 64 is 384. However, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), then it would be 6 times 20, which is 120. But the problem didn't specify any restriction on the power of \\(c\\), so I think it's the first case, where we're just looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\)'s exponent. Therefore, the coefficient is 384. Wait, but let me think again. When you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in one polynomial is multiplied by all terms in the other polynomial. So, in this case, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is being multiplied by every term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, each term in the expansion will be \\(a^2b^2 \\times \\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the sum over all \\(k\\) of \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}\\), multiplied by 6. So, that sum is 64, as before, so 6 times 64 is 384. Therefore, the coefficient is 384. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to consider only the term where the exponents of \\(c\\) are zero, so that the entire term is \\(a^2b^2\\), but I think that's not the case unless specified. So, I think the correct answer is 384. But wait, let me confirm by another approach. Alternatively, perhaps I can consider that the entire expression is a product of two independent expansions, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Since the sum of coefficients in the second expression is 64, as calculated earlier, then 6 times 64 is indeed 384. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting me to treat \\(c\\) as a separate variable and to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in that case, yes, it's 384. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting me to consider that \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) are separate variables, and so the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would have a coefficient that's the product of the binomial coefficients from both expansions. Wait, but no, that's not quite right. Let me think again. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When you expand this, each term is of the form \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}a^{4 - k}b^k \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - m}\\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying the second part, it's \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, each term is \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}\\dbinom{6}{m}a^{4 - k}b^k c^{6 - 2m}\\). Now, we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, in the first part, \\(a^{4 - k}b^k\\), we set \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). So, \\(k = 2\\), and the coefficient from the first part is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Now, for each \\(m\\) in the second part, we have \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\) as the coefficient, and the term becomes \\(a^2b^2 \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the sum over all \\(m\\) of \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\dbinom{6}{m}\\), which is \\(6 \\times \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m}\\). But \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). Therefore, the answer is 384. But wait, let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. Another way to think about it is that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is equal to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, since the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and when you multiply by the entire expansion of the second part, each term in that expansion is multiplied by 6, so the total coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) across all terms involving \\(c\\) would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, giving 384. Alternatively, if the problem had asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion, which is 20, giving 120. But since it's just \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\), I think it's 384. Therefore, I believe the coefficient is 384.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{384}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem.\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\), so the coefficient is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\n   \\]\n\n2. **Consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n   \\]\n   Each term in this expansion is of the form \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\).\n\n3. **Multiply the term \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the sum of the products of the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) and each term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).

    "text": " So, the coefficient from the first part is 6. Now, the expression also has the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I wonder if this part affects the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, the second part is multiplied by the first part, so the entire expression is the product of the two expansions. But since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are different variables, the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) won't interact with the terms involving \\(c\\). So, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) will just be the product of the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) and the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), right? Wait, no, that doesn't seem right. Because when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term in the first polynomial, then in the product, it will be multiplied by every term in the second polynomial. But since the second polynomial is in terms of \\(c\\), and \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are different variables, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will actually be the same as the coefficient in the first polynomial times the entire second polynomial. Wait, but that doesn't make sense because the second polynomial has multiple terms. Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when I expand this, it's like each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are separate variables, the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) won't affect the terms involving \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems too big. Wait, no, actually, no. Because in the product, each term from the first expansion is multiplied by each term from the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Because when you multiply by each term in the second part, each term adds a coefficient to the product. So, the total coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 (from the first part) multiplied by the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but the sum of the coefficients in a polynomial is found by plugging in 1 for all variables. So, for \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), if I set \\(c = 1\\), then it becomes \\((1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of the coefficients is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 times 64, which is 384. Wait, but let me check this again. Let me think of it differently. Let me consider the entire expression as two separate expansions: one in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and one in \\(c\\). When you multiply them, each term in the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) expansion is multiplied by each term in the \\(c\\) expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because each term in the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) part is multiplied by every term in the \\(c\\) part, and since \\(c\\) terms don't affect \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), the coefficients just add up. So, as I thought earlier, the sum of coefficients in the \\(c\\) expansion is 64, so 6 times 64 is 384. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 384. Wait, but let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. Let me consider a simpler case. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^1 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, \\((a + b)(c + 1/c)\\) would expand to \\(ac + a/c + bc + b/c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a\\) is \\(c + 1/c\\), but if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a\\), it's actually the entire expression \\(c + 1/c\\), but that's not a constant. Wait, but in this case, since \\(a\\) and \\(c\\) are separate variables, the coefficient of \\(a\\) would actually be a polynomial in \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient of \\(a\\) is \\(c + 1/c\\), which is not a constant. So, maybe my earlier approach is wrong. Because in the problem, we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but in the product, the terms involving \\(c\\) would still be there. So, perhaps the coefficient isn't just 6 times 64, but instead, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that can't be right because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, not a polynomial. So, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question. Wait, maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in other words, when you multiply out the entire expression, you get terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for various \\(k\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually be the sum of all coefficients where the term is \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for any \\(k\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Because each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) is 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^k\\) in the second expansion. Therefore, the total coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\) is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, giving 384. So, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe I can approach it differently. Let me consider the entire expansion. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, as I found before. Then, when I multiply by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is multiplied by every term in the second part, which includes \\(c^6\\), \\(c^4\\), \\(c^2\\), \\(c^0\\), \\(c^{-2}\\), \\(c^{-4}\\), \\(c^{-6}\\), each with their own coefficients. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 64. So, 6 times 64 is 384. Therefore, the coefficient is 384. I think that makes sense. So, I'm confident that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 384.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. Let me compute the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) to make sure the sum of coefficients is indeed 64. Using the binomial theorem, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). The sum of the coefficients would be when \\(c = 1\\), so substituting \\(c = 1\\), we get \\((1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\), which matches. So, that's correct. Therefore, the sum of the coefficients is 64, and multiplying that by 6 gives 384. So, yes, I think the answer is 384.\n\nBut wait, another way to think about it is to consider that when you have two polynomials multiplied together, the coefficient of a specific term in one polynomial is multiplied by the entire other polynomial. So, in this case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial is 6, and when multiplied by the second polynomial, each term in the second polynomial adds to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\) is 6 times the sum of the coefficients of the second polynomial, which is 64, giving 384. So, that seems consistent.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem was asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then we would have to compute the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second polynomial and multiply by 6. But since the problem just says the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), without specifying \\(c\\), I think it's asking for the sum of all coefficients where the term is \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for any \\(k\\). So, that would be 6 times 64, which is 384.\n\nWait, but let me check if that's the standard interpretation. When someone asks for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in a product like this, do they mean considering all possible powers of \\(c\\), or just the constant term with respect to \\(c\\)? Hmm, I think it's the former. Because otherwise, if they wanted only the constant term in \\(c\\), they would specify \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). So, I think it's safe to assume that the coefficient is considering all powers of \\(c\\), so the answer is 384.\n\nWait, but to make sure, let me consider an example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^1 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, expanding, we have \\(ac + a/c + bc + b/c\\). The coefficient of \\(a\\) would be \\(c + 1/c\\), which is a polynomial in \\(c\\). So, if someone asks for the coefficient of \\(a\\), it's not a single number but a polynomial. So, in that case, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient as a polynomial in \\(c\\), but the problem didn't specify. Hmm, that's confusing. Wait, but in the problem statement, it just says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", without mentioning \\(c\\). So, perhaps it's considering all terms where the variables \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are squared, regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would indeed be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 64, giving 384. So, I think that's the correct approach.\n\nWait, another way to think about it: the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), because each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times 64, which is 384.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is expecting a different approach, where we treat \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) as separate variables and find the coefficient only considering \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which would be a polynomial. But since the problem just asks for the coefficient, perhaps it's expecting a numerical value, implying that it's considering all terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present, regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, that would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 64, giving 384.\n\nWait, but to make sure, let me think about the original expression: \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). When you expand this, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is multiplied by every term in the second part, which includes \\(c^6\\), \\(c^4\\), \\(c^2\\), \\(c^0\\), \\(c^{-2}\\), \\(c^{-4}\\), \\(c^{-6}\\), each with their own coefficients. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the sum of \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by each of these terms.

    "text": " So, the coefficient is 6. \n\nNow, the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but the term we're looking for is \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\). So, does that mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just 6 times whatever the coefficient is for \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)? Because when you multiply the two expansions together, the terms will multiply, and we're only interested in the terms where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2, and the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out, i.e., \\(c^0\\). \n\nWait, but actually, no. Because when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. So, in this case, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), that would mean that we're looking for the term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) that has \\(c^0\\), because then when we multiply it by \\(a^2b^2\\), the resulting term will still be \\(a^2b^2\\) times 1 (since \\(c^0 = 1\\)). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 (from the first part) multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nSo, now I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me expand that using the binomial theorem as well. \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying the exponents, that becomes \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m - m} = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, we're looking for the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, i.e., \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(6 = 2m\\), so \\(m = 3\\). \n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Let me compute that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient is 20. \n\nNow, going back to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficients from each part, because \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first part and \\(c^0\\) comes from the second part. So, that would be 6 (from \\((a + b)^4\\)) multiplied by 20 (from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)). \n\nCalculating that, 6 * 20 = 120. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120. \n\nWait a second, let me make sure I didn't miss anything. The problem is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, when we expand both, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second. But since we're only looking for the term that has \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), that means we need to find the term in the first expansion where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present, and in the second expansion, the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. So, yes, that would be correct. \n\nAlternatively, another way to think about it is that the entire expression is a product of two independent binomial expansions. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just the coefficient from the first part, and since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, the second part contributes 1 when \\(c^0\\) is considered, but since the coefficient is 20, we have to multiply 6 by 20, which gives 120. \n\nI think that makes sense. Let me just recap: \n\n1. Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using binomial theorem. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. \n2. Expand \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) using binomial theorem. The coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. \n3. Multiply these two coefficients together because when you multiply the two polynomials, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, but we only want the term where \\(c^0\\) is present to keep the term as \\(a^2b^2\\). \n\nSo, 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient is 120. \n\nI don't think I made any mistakes here. The logic seems solid. I considered both parts separately, found the required coefficients, and then multiplied them together because they're independent. Yeah, I think that's correct.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is found by expanding each part separately and then multiplying the relevant coefficients. \n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\):**\n   - The term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\) in the binomial expansion.\n   - Coefficient: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n\n2. **Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   - We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, which occurs when \\(m = 3\\).\n   - Coefficient: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n\n3. **Multiply the coefficients:**\n   - \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

    "text": " So, the coefficient is 6. Now, that's just the first part. The entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Hmm, so I think I need to consider how this multiplication affects the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, but the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms are separate from the \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) terms. So, when I multiply out the two expressions, each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).

Wait, is that correct? Let me think again. So, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). When I expand this, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\).

So, I need to find the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). How do I find that? Well, the sum of the coefficients in a polynomial is found by substituting \\(c = 1\\). So, if I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(1 + 1/1\\right)^6 = (2)^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of the coefficients in the second part is 64.

Alternatively, maybe I can think of it as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6, and since the second part is multiplied by it, every term in the second part will just scale the 6 by their respective coefficients. So, the total coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) times each term in the second expansion is 6 times each coefficient in the second expansion. But when we're just looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), that would mean we're summing all those scaled coefficients.

Wait, but since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and that term doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), maybe the coefficient is just 6 times whatever the coefficient is for the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by the constant term in the second expansion, that's the only term that would result in a term that's just \\(a^2b^2\\) times a constant.

So, I think I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), and then multiply it by 6 to get the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\). So, let me find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Again, using the binomial theorem: \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\).

Wait, but the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so maybe the second part doesn't affect this coefficient because \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). Let me think. Since the entire expression is the product of \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), when we multiply them, each term in the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), the coefficient should just be the coefficient from the first part, right? Because when you multiply by terms from the second expansion, you'll get terms that include \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), but \\(a^2b^2\\) is only from the first part. So, maybe the coefficient remains 6. \n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not missing anything. Let me write out the product more explicitly. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).

So, for example, \\(a^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, resulting in terms like \\(a^4c^6\\), \\(a^4 \\times 6c^4\\), etc. Similarly, \\(4a^3b\\) will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, and so on.\n\nBut since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion, we need to see what happens when this term is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. Specifically, we need to find all terms in the product where the result is \\(a^2b^2\\) times some power of \\(c\\), but since the problem doesn't specify any condition on \\(c\\), it's just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). Wait, no, actually, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term without any \\(c\\) terms. So, actually, in the entire product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, but the only way to get a term that is just \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) is if it's multiplied by the constant term in the second expansion. Let me check: the second expansion is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), and when expanded, the constant term is 20. So, when we multiply \\(6a^2b^2\\) by 20, we get \\(120a^2b^2\\). \n\nWait, but hold on, is that the only term that contributes to \\(a^2b^2\\)? Because if I multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by any other term in the second expansion, like \\(c^6\\), I would get \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), which is a different term. Similarly, multiplying by \\(c^4\\) gives \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), and so on. So, the only term that remains as \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms is when it's multiplied by the constant term 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the constant term in the second part), which is 120.\n\nWait, but let me double-check this because I might be making a mistake. Let me think again: the first expansion gives me terms in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the second expansion gives me terms in \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). When I multiply them, the product will have terms that are combinations of \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\), and \\(1/c\\). The term \\(a^2b^2\\) is only present in the first expansion, and when I multiply it by each term in the second expansion, the only way to get a term that's just \\(a^2b^2\\) is if I multiply it by the constant term in the second expansion, which is 20. So, the coefficient is indeed 6 times 20, which is 120.\n\nWait another thought: Is the problem asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), or only when there are no \\(c\\) terms? Because if it's regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then the coefficient would be 6 times the entire second expansion, but that doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a specific term. So, I think it's asking for the coefficient when considering all possible powers of \\(c\\). But no, actually, the problem is written as \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", which typically means the coefficient when considering all variables, but in this case, since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), it's more likely that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times any power of \\(c\\). Wait, but that would mean the coefficient is 6 times the entire second expansion, which is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But that can't be right because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, not a polynomial. So, perhaps the problem is intended to have \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by some power of \\(c\\), but the problem statement doesn't specify, so I think I might have misinterpreted it.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\), which is the constant term. So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times 20, which is 120. Alternatively, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then it would be 6 times the entire second expansion, but that's not a single number, so I think the former interpretation is correct. Therefore, the coefficient is 120.\n\nWait, but let me check again. Let me consider the entire expansion. The first part is \\((a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). The second part is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15/c^2 + 6/c^4 + 1/c^6\\). Now, when I multiply these two, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second part, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(6a^2b^2c^4\\), \\(15a^2b^2c^2\\), \\(20a^2b^2\\), \\(15a^2b^2/c^2\\), etc. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) is only present once, when it's multiplied by 20, giving \\(120a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient is 120.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem had asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^2\\), it would have been 6 times 15, which is 90, but that's not the case here. So, I think I'm confident that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120.\n\nWait, just to make sure, let me think about another approach. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the coefficient from the first part, multiplied by the entire second expansion. But that doesn't make sense because the coefficient would then be a polynomial in \\(c\\). Therefore, I think the correct interpretation is that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), which is the constant term in \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient is 6 (from \\(a^2b^2\\)) multiplied by 20 (from the constant term in the second expansion), giving 120.\n\nYes, I think that's correct. So, the coefficient is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplying it by the constant term (20) in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Thus, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\boxed{120}"

That means I don't need to consider the terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) because \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't have any \\(c\\) terms. So, maybe I just need the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) and then multiply it by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but actually, no, because when you multiply two expressions together, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression. However, since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), that means we only need the term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) that has \\(c^0\\), because \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\) would still be \\(a^2b^2\\). So, I need to find the term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) that has \\(c^0\\). Let me apply the binomial theorem again to \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The expansion is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying each term: \\(c^{6 - m} \\times c^{-m} = c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the exponent on \\(c\\) is \\(6 - 2m\\). We want the exponent to be 0, so we set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the term with \\(c^0\\) is when \\(m = 3\\), and the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\).

So, the key was to realize that since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), we only need the constant term (with respect to \\(c\\)) from the second part of the expression. And that term's coefficient is 20. Then, the coefficient from the first part for \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, so 6 times 20 is indeed 120. I think that's correct. Let me just check the binomial coefficients again to be sure. For \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\), that's correct. For \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term where \\(m = 3\\) gives the exponent 0, and \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\), that's also correct.

Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" Oh, perhaps I need to consider that the entire expression is a product of two polynomials, one in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the other in \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, when you multiply them together, the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from those involving \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the entire second part, because every term in the second part will multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term, but since they involve different variables, they don't affect the exponent of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). Wait, but that doesn't make sense because when you multiply, each term from the first expansion is multiplied by each term from the second expansion, but in this case, since the variables are different, the product will have terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2 \\cdot c^{-k}\\), but the term \\(a^2b^2\\) itself would only come from multiplying \\(a^2b^2\\) by the constant term in the second expansion, if there is one. \n\nWait, let me think again. The second expression is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me expand that using the binomial theorem as well. So, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, each term in this expansion is \\(c^{6 - 2m}\\), where \\(m\\) goes from 0 to 6. Now, when I multiply this by \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term from the first expansion, I get terms like \\(a^2b^2 \\cdot c^{6 - 2m}\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would mean the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2, but the exponent of \\(c\\) can be anything, right? Wait, no, that doesn't seem correct. Actually, I think I'm making a mistake here. Let me clarify: when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial will be multiplied by each term in the second polynomial, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^{6 - 2m}\\). However, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would require that the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, because otherwise, the term would have \\(c\\) raised to some power, making it \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), which is not just \\(a^2b^2\\). So, in order for the term to be exactly \\(a^2b^2\\), we need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be zero. That means we need to find the term in the second expansion where \\(c^{6 - 2m} = c^0\\), which implies that \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(m = 3\\). \n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second polynomial. So, the coefficient from the first part is 6, as I found earlier. Now, the coefficient from the second part when \\(m = 3\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Let me calculate that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). \n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). \n\nWait, let me double-check that.

So, I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me use the binomial theorem again for this. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\).

Because if I multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by \\(c^k\\), it would be \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), which isn't just \\(a^2b^2\\). So, to get a term that's just \\(a^2b^2\\), I need to multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by the constant term in the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient I'm looking for is 6 times the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). \n\nSo, now I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Let's expand this using the binomial theorem as well. The expansion is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(1/c\\right)^m\\). Simplifying each term, that's \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\times c^{-m}\\), which is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, each term has an exponent of \\(c\\) equal to \\(6 - 2m\\). We want the term where the exponent is zero because that's the constant term. So, set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). So, the constant term is the term when \\(m = 3\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). \n\nSo, the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the constant term in the second part). So, 6 times 20 is 120. \n\nWait, let me just make sure I didn't make any mistakes here. So, first, I found the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) correctly as 6. Then, I considered that when multiplying by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the only way to get a term without \\(c\\) is by multiplying by the constant term in the second expansion, which I found to be 20. So, 6 times 20 is indeed 120. I think that makes sense. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think about it another way to verify. Suppose I expand both parts separately and then multiply. The expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) gives terms up to \\(a^4\\) and \\(b^4\\), and the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) gives terms with different powers of \\(c\\). When I multiply these two expansions together, each term in the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) where \\(k\\) is from \\(-6\\) to \\(6\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, that is, when \\(k = 0\\), which as I found earlier, is 20. So, the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nI think that's correct. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning. So, the coefficient should be 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem.\n\nFirst, consider the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n\\]\nWe need the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2. This corresponds to \\(k = 2\\):\n\\[\n\\dbinom{4}{2} a^2 b^2 = 6 a^2 b^2\n\\]\nSo, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\nNext, consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem:\n\\[\n\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n\\]\nWe need the constant term, which occurs when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero:\n\\[\n6 - 2m = 0 \\implies m = 3\n\\]\nThe constant term is:\n\\[\n\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\n\\]\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, we multiply the coefficient from the first expansion by the constant term from the second expansion:\n\\[\n6 \\times 20 = 120\n\\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}."

    "text": " So, the term is \\(6a^2b^2\\). \n\nNow, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I need to consider how this multiplication affects the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, but \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are in the first part, and \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) are in the second part. So, when I multiply these two expressions together, the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) will multiply with the terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), maybe the terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) don't affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, that doesn't make sense because when you multiply, each term from the first expansion will multiply each term from the second expansion. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all the coefficients from the second part, because \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), so when multiplied by any term from the second expansion, it would just contribute to the overall coefficient. \n\nWait, let me think again. So, if I have \\((a + b)^4\\) times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), and I want the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), that would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the entire expansion of the second part, because \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), so when multiplied by any term from the second expansion, it's just \\(a^2b^2\\) times whatever comes from the second part. But wait, actually, no. Because when you multiply two polynomials, each term from the first is multiplied by each term from the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Because each term in the second part is a coefficient times some power of \\(c\\), but when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), it just becomes \\(a^2b^2\\) times that coefficient times \\(c^k\\), so the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all coefficients in the second part. \n\nWait, but is that correct? Let me check. If I have \\( (a + b)^4 \\times (c + 1/c)^6 \\), then the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by every term in the second expansion. So, for example, \\(a^2b^2 \\times c^6\\) would be a term, \\(a^2b^2 \\times c^5\\) times something, and so on, down to \\(a^2b^2 \\times c^{-6}\\). So, each of these terms would have the same \\(a^2b^2\\) part, but different powers of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Because each term in the second expansion contributes its own coefficient when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). \n\nSo, to find the total coefficient, I can compute the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiply it by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Now, the sum of all coefficients in a polynomial is found by plugging in 1 for all variables. So, in this case, the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) would be \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the total coefficient would be 6 times 64, which is 384. \n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. Alternatively, maybe I should think of it differently. Let me consider the entire expression as a product of two independent expansions. So, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6, as we found. Now, in the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the sum of all coefficients is indeed 64, as I calculated. So, when I multiply the two expansions together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times 64, which is 384. \n\nWait, but let me verify this another way. Maybe I can think of it as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial. So, in other words, because \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), when you multiply it by each term in the second expansion, it just gets multiplied by the coefficient of that term. So, the total contribution to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all coefficients in the second part. So, 6 times 64 is 384. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of it as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the product of the coefficients from each part. But that's not quite right because the second part isn't a single term, it's an entire expansion. So, actually, the coefficient would be the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all coefficients from the second part. \n\nWait, let me think again. If I have two polynomials, P(a, b) and Q(c), then the product P(a, b) * Q(c) will have terms where each term from P is multiplied by each term from Q. So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of a specific term in P(a, b), say \\(a^2b^2\\), then in the product, this term will be multiplied by every term in Q(c). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in P(a, b) times the sum of all coefficients in Q(c). Because each term in Q(c) contributes its coefficient when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). \n\nSo, in this case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in P(a, b) is 6, and the sum of all coefficients in Q(c) is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nWait, but let me make sure that this approach is correct. Let me take a simpler example. Suppose I have (a + b)^2 * (c + 1/c)^1. Then, the coefficient of a^2b^2 in the first part is \\(\\dbinom{2}{2} = 1\\), and the sum of coefficients in the second part is (1 + 1) = 2. So, the coefficient of a^2b^2 in the product would be 1 * 2 = 2. Let me check by expanding: (a + b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2. (c + 1/c)^1 = c + 1/c. So, the product is (a^2 + 2ab + b^2)(c + 1/c). The term a^2b^2 would only come from a^2 * (1/c) * b^2, but wait, that's not correct because a^2 is multiplied by c and 1/c, but b^2 is a separate term. Wait, actually, no, because in the product, each term from the first polynomial is multiplied by each term from the second. So, a^2 * c is a^2c, a^2 * (1/c) is a^2/c, 2ab * c is 2abc, 2ab * (1/c) is 2ab/c, b^2 * c is b^2c, and b^2 * (1/c) is b^2/c. So, there is no a^2b^2 term in the product because the terms from the first polynomial are a^2, 2ab, and b^2, and the terms from the second are c and 1/c. So, when you multiply, you get terms like a^2c, a^2/c, 2abc, 2ab/c, b^2c, b^2/c. There is no a^2b^2 term, so the coefficient is zero. But according to my earlier approach, I would have said the coefficient is 1 (from a^2b^2 in the first part) times 2 (sum of coefficients in the second part), which is 2. But that's not correct because the actual coefficient is zero. So, that means my earlier approach is wrong. \n\nHmm, so that approach doesn't work. So, I need to rethink this. Maybe I made a mistake in assuming that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient in the first part times the sum of coefficients in the second part. That seems to not hold in this simpler case. So, where did I go wrong? \n\nWait, perhaps I'm confusing how the terms combine. Let me consider that the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would only come from multiplying the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first part by the constant term in the second part. Because if I have \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part, and I multiply it by any term from the second part that has a power of \\(c\\), then the resulting term would have \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^k\\) for some k, which would not be a pure \\(a^2b^2\\) term unless \\(k = 0\\). But in the second part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the only term with \\(c^0\\) is the constant term, which is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\), because when k = 3, the exponent is 6 - 3*2 = 0. So, in that case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part. \n\nWait, that makes more sense. Because if I have \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part, and I multiply it by \\(c^0\\) from the second part, that would give me \\(a^2b^2\\), which is the term we're interested in. Any other term from the second part would have a power of \\(c\\), so when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), it would result in a term like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), which isn't just \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the only contribution to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product comes from the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first part multiplied by the constant term in the second part. \n\nSo, in the simpler example I had earlier, where I had \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part (which is 1, from \\(a^2\\)) times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part. But in the second part, \\((c + 1/c)^1 = c + 1/c\\), which has no constant term. So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is zero. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 1 * 0 = 0, which matches the actual expansion. \n\nSo, in our original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part. \n\nSo, let's calculate that. \n\nFirst, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\), as I found earlier. \n\nNow, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is the middle term when the exponent is even. The general term in the expansion is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\times (1/c)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We want the exponent of \\(c\\) to be zero, so we set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). \n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. \n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). \n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was 384, but that was based on a wrong assumption. Now, after correcting my mistake, I think it's 120. \n\nWait, let me confirm this with another approach. Let's consider the entire product as \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first part, and the constant term from the second part. So, the coefficient is 6 (from the first part) times 20 (from the second part), which is 120. \n\nTo make sure, let me compute the product more carefully. \n\nIn \\((a + b)^4\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6a^2b^2. \n\nIn \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). \n\nSo, when we multiply these two, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by 20 from the second part, giving \\(6 \\times 20 a^2b^2 = 120a^2b^2\\). \n\nTherefore, the coefficient is 120. \n\nI think that's correct. So, my initial approach was wrong because I thought that the coefficient would be multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part, but that's not the case. Instead, it's only multiplied by the coefficient of the constant term in the second part because that's the only term that doesn't introduce any \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\) factors. \n\nSo, the correct coefficient is 120. \n\nWait, but just to be thorough, let me consider another example to confirm. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^2\\). Then, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be \\(\\dbinom{2}{2} = 1\\) times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\((c + 1/c)^2\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{2}{1} = 2\\), so 1 * 2 = 2. Let's expand it: \\((a + b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2\\), and \\((c + 1/c)^2 = c^2 + 2 + 1/c^2\\). So, the product would be (a^2 + 2ab + b^2)(c^2 + 2 + 1/c^2). The term \\(a^2b^2\\) would come from \\(a^2 * 2\\) and \\(b^2 * 2\\), but wait, no. Wait, actually, when you multiply \\(a^2\\) by 2, you get \\(2a^2\\), and when you multiply \\(b^2\\) by 2, you get \\(2b^2\\). But \\(a^2b^2\\) would come from \\(a^2 * 2 * b^2\\), but that's not correct because in the product, each term from the first polynomial is multiplied by each term from the second. So, \\(a^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^2\\), 2, and \\(1/c^2\\), giving \\(a^2c^2\\), \\(2a^2\\), and \\(a^2/c^2\\). Similarly, \\(2ab\\) is multiplied by each term, giving \\(2ab c^2\\), \\(4ab\\), and \\(2ab / c^2\\). And \\(b^2\\) is multiplied by each term, giving \\(b^2c^2\\), \\(2b^2\\), and \\(b^2/c^2\\). \n\nSo, in this product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would come from \\(a^2 * 2 * b^2\\), but actually, that's not how it works. Each term is separate. So, the term \\(2a^2\\) is just \\(2a^2\\), and the term \\(2b^2\\) is just \\(2b^2\\). There's no \\(a^2b^2\\) term unless you multiply \\(a^2\\) by \\(b^2\\), but in the product, \\(a^2\\) is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial, and \\(b^2\\) is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. So, the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) is if there's a term in the second polynomial that is 1, so that \\(a^2\\) times 1 times \\(b^2\\) equals \\(a^2b^2\\). But in this case, the second polynomial has a constant term 2. So, when you multiply \\(a^2\\) by 2, you get \\(2a^2\\), and \\(b^2\\) by 2, you get \\(2b^2\\). But there's no term that is \\(a^2b^2\\) unless you have \\(a^2\\) times \\(b^2\\) times something. Wait, no, because in the product, each term from the first polynomial is multiplied by each term from the second. So, \\(a^2\\) is multiplied by each term in the second, giving \\(a^2c^2\\), \\(2a^2\\), and \\(a^2/c^2\\). Similarly, \\(2ab\\) is multiplied by each term, giving \\(2ab c^2\\), \\(4ab\\), and \\(2ab/c^2\\). And \\(b^2\\) is multiplied by each term, giving \\(b^2c^2\\), \\(2b^2\\), and \\(b^2/c^2\\). \n\nWait, so in this case, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't actually appear because none of the cross terms between \\(a^2\\) and \\(b^2\\) are present. The only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) is if there's a term that combines \\(a^2\\) and \\(b^2\\) from the first polynomial and a term that is 1 from the second polynomial. But in this case, the second polynomial doesn't have a 1 term; it has \\(c^2\\), 2, and \\(1/c^2\\). So, the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) is if you have \\(a^2\\) times 2 times \\(b^2\\), but that's not how polynomial multiplication works. Each term is separate, so \\(a^2\\) times 2 is \\(2a^2\\), and \\(b^2\\) times 2 is \\(2b^2\\). There's no \\(a^2b^2\\) term. So, in this case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be zero, not 2. \n\nWait, that contradicts my earlier approach where I thought the coefficient would be 1 (from the first part) times 2 (from the second part) equals 2. But in reality, the coefficient is zero. So, my approach is still wrong. \n\nHmm, so I must be misunderstanding how the terms interact. Let me try to clarify. \n\nIn the product \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) can only come from multiplying the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first polynomial by a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\) in the second polynomial. Because if you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by a term involving \\(c\\), you'll get a term like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), which isn't just \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is if you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by the constant term in the second polynomial. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second polynomial. \n\nIn the example I just did, \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^2\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial is 1, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second polynomial is 2. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product should be 1 * 2 = 2. But when I expanded it earlier, I didn't see any \\(a^2b^2\\) term. Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the expansion. Let me check again. \n\nWait, in \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^2\\), the first polynomial is \\(a^2 + 2ab + b^2\\), and the second is \\(c^2 + 2 + 1/c^2\\). So, when I multiply these, I get:\n\n- \\(a^2 \\times c^2 = a^2c^2\\)\n- \\(a^2 \\times 2 = 2a^2\\)\n- \\(a^2 \\times 1/c^2 = a^2/c^2\\)\n- \\(2ab \\times c^2 = 2ab c^2\\)\n- \\(2ab \\times 2 = 4ab\\)\n- \\(2ab \\times 1/c^2 = 4ab/c^2\\)\n- \\(b^2 \\times c^2 = b^2c^2\\)\n- \\(b^2 \\times 2 = 2b^2\\)\n- \\(b^2 \\times 1/c^2 = b^2/c^2\\)\n\nSo, looking at all these terms, I don't see an \\(a^2b^2\\) term. Therefore, the coefficient is indeed zero, which contradicts my earlier conclusion that it should be 2. So, where is the mistake here? \n\nWait, perhaps the confusion arises because \\(a^2b^2\\) isn't being formed by multiplying terms from the two polynomials. Instead, \\(a^2b^2\\) would require a term that combines \\(a^2\\) and \\(b^2\\) from the first polynomial and a term that is 1 from the second polynomial. But in reality, each term from the first polynomial is multiplied by each term from the second, so \\(a^2\\) is multiplied by each term in the second, and \\(b^2\\) is multiplied by each term in the second. So, there's no way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) unless you have a term that combines \\(a^2\\) and \\(b^2\\) from the first polynomial, but in the first polynomial, the terms are separate: \\(a^2\\), \\(2ab\\), and \\(b^2\\). So, when you multiply by the second polynomial, you can't combine \\(a^2\\) and \\(b^2\\) into \\(a^2b^2\\) because they are separate terms. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is indeed zero, not 2. \n\nWait, that means my initial approach was wrong. So, perhaps the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is if there's a term that combines \\(a^2\\) and \\(b^2\\) from the first polynomial and a term that is 1 from the second polynomial. But in reality, in the product, each term from the first polynomial is multiplied by each term from the second. So, unless there's a term in the first polynomial that is \\(a^2b^2\\), which there isn't unless you have a cross term, you can't get \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. \n\nWait, but in the original problem, \\((a + b)^4\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) does exist, with coefficient 6. So, when I multiply that by the constant term in the second polynomial, which is 20, I should get \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\) as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). \n\nWait, but in the example I just did, \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^2\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't exist in the product because there's no \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first polynomial. But in our original problem, \\((a + b)^4\\) does have an \\(a^2b^2\\) term, so when we multiply by the constant term in the second polynomial, we do get an \\(a^2b^2\\) term. \n\nSo, perhaps the key is that in the first polynomial, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) exists, so when you multiply it by the constant term in the second polynomial, you get \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. But in the example where the first polynomial is \\((a + b)^2\\), which doesn't have an \\(a^2b^2\\) term, the product doesn't have an \\(a^2b^2\\) term either. \n\nTherefore, in our original problem, since \\((a + b)^4\\) does have an \\(a^2b^2\\) term, and the second polynomial has a constant term, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is indeed 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nI think that makes sense now. So, the correct coefficient is 120. \n\nWait, but to make sure, let me try another example where the first polynomial has a term \\(a^2b^2\\) and the second has a constant term. Let's say \\((a + b)^4 \\times (c + 1/c)^2\\). Then, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 (from the first part) times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part, which is 2. So, 6 * 2 = 12. Let's see if that's correct. \n\nExpanding \\((a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). \n\nExpanding \\((c + 1/c)^2 = c^2 + 2 + 1/c^2\\). \n\nNow, multiplying these together, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) from the first polynomial will be multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. So, \\(6a^2b^2 \\times c^2 = 6a^2b^2c^2\\), \\(6a^2b^2 \\times 2 = 12a^2b^2\\), and \\(6a^2b^2 \\times 1/c^2 = 6a^2b^2/c^2\\). \n\nSo, in the product, the term \\(12a^2b^2\\) is present, which means the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 12, which is 6 * 2, as expected. \n\nTherefore, in our original problem, since the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part is 20, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nI think that's correct now. So, the final answer is 120. \n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem and consider the contributions from each part of the product.\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\):\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\n   \\]\n   So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\n2. **Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n   \\]\n   The constant term (where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0) occurs when \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\):\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\n   \\]\n   So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20.\n\n3. **Combine the results:**\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is the product of the coefficients from each part:\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 20 = 120\n   \\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}."

    "text": " Okay, so that part gives me a coefficient of 6 for \\(a^2b^2\\).\n\nNow, the expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I notice that this part only involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), so when I multiply the entire expression, the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms will combine with the \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) terms. But wait, the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so I might not need to consider the \\(c\\) terms unless they affect the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. Hmm, actually, when I multiply two expressions together, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression. But since I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I can consider the part of the second expression that doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), which is just a constant with respect to \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). Wait, no, that's not quite right. Let me think again.\n\nWait, actually, no. The second part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), so when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But since I'm only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), that term will only come from the product of the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first part and the constant term (with respect to \\(a\\) and \\(b\\)) in the second part. Wait, but actually, the second part doesn't have any \\(a\\) or \\(b\\) terms, so when I multiply, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will just be multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part, which is a sum of terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). But wait, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but without considering the \\(c\\) terms. Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the question. Let me check again.\n\nWait, the problem says: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, perhaps the question is treating the entire expression as a polynomial in \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\), and \\(1/c\\), and it's asking for the coefficient of the term \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, in other words, when you expand the entire expression, you'll have terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for various \\(k\\), and the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the sum of all the coefficients of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for any \\(k\\). Alternatively, maybe it's just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times some expression in \\(c\\), but perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient in the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) parts, treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable. Hmm, I'm a bit confused now.\n\nWait, maybe another approach. Let me think of the entire expression as the product of two separate expansions: one in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and one in \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, when I multiply them together, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, which is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. But that doesn't make sense because the coefficient would then be a polynomial in \\(c\\), not a single number. So, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when considering the entire expression as a polynomial, but only looking at the \\(a^2b^2\\) term regardless of the \\(c\\) exponents. So, in other words, the coefficient would be the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients from the second part. Wait, no, that's not correct either because the second part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which has its own expansion.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try to approach it step by step. First, I can expand \\((a + b)^4\\) as I did before, and find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is 6. Then, the second part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). If I expand this, each term will be of the form \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, each term in the expansion is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\) for \\(k = 0\\) to \\(6\\). Now, when I multiply the two expansions together, each term in the first expansion (like \\(a^2b^2\\)) will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second part, resulting in terms like \\(6 \\times \\dbinom{6}{k} a^2b^2 c^{6 - 2k}\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the sum over all \\(k\\) of \\(6 \\times \\dbinom{6}{k}\\), because each term contributes to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) with different powers of \\(c\\). Wait, but that would mean the coefficient is \\(6 \\times (1 + 6 + 15 + 20 + 15 + 6 + 1)\\) since the sum of binomial coefficients for \\(n = 6\\) is \\(2^6 = 64\\). So, 6 times 64 would be 384. But that seems too high. Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, meaning that it's just the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part, which would make the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) equal to 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, not an expression. So, maybe I'm approaching this wrong.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to consider that when multiplying the two expressions, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, but the problem is only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, in other words, the coefficient would be the sum of all the coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by 6. Because each term in the second expansion is a coefficient times a power of \\(c\\), and when you multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), each of those coefficients contributes to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. So, the total coefficient would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion. The sum of the coefficients in the second expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 * 64 = 384. But that seems really large, and I'm not sure if that's correct.\n\nWait, let me think again. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. So, when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each polynomial. But in this case, the first polynomial is in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the second is in \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial doesn't depend on \\(c\\), so when you multiply it by the entire second polynomial, each term in the second polynomial will be multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), resulting in terms like \\(6 \\times \\dbinom{6}{k} a^2b^2 c^{6 - 2k}\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is indeed 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial. The sum of coefficients in the second polynomial is found by substituting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1/1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, 6 * 64 = 384. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 384. But wait, that seems correct, but let me check with an example.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of it as the entire expression being \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, when expanding, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second part, each of which has a coefficient. So, the total coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part (which is 6) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part. The sum of coefficients in the second part is indeed 64, as calculated before. So, 6 * 64 = 384. Therefore, the coefficient is 384.\n\nWait, but maybe I'm missing something. Let me try to see if there's another way to approach this. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without considering the \\(c\\) terms, which would mean that the coefficient is just 6, because the \\(c\\) terms are separate. But that doesn't make sense because when you multiply, the coefficients do combine. I think the correct approach is that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 multiplied by the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, giving 384.\n\nWait, but let me think again: when you have two polynomials multiplied together, the coefficient of a specific term is the sum of the products of the coefficients of terms whose variables multiply to give that specific term. But in this case, the variables are different: \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) in the first polynomial, and \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) can only come from the product of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial and any term in the second polynomial, because the second polynomial doesn't have \\(a\\) or \\(b\\) terms. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial. Since the sum of coefficients in the second polynomial is 64, as before, the total coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me check this with a smaller example to see if this approach is correct. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, expanding, we have \\((a^2 + 2ab + b^2) \\times (c + 1/c)\\). The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be zero because there's no \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the product. Wait, but according to my previous approach, the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) in the first part is 1, and the sum of coefficients in the second part is 2, so 1 * 2 = 2, which would be the coefficient of \\(a^2\\), but that's not correct because the actual product has terms like \\(a^2c\\) and \\(a^2/c\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) is \\(c + 1/c\\), which is a polynomial, not a number. So, in this case, my approach would be incorrect because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, not a polynomial coefficient.\n\nWait, so perhaps I misunderstood the problem. Maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, considering all possible exponents of \\(c\\). But then, the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\), not a number. But the problem didn't specify, so maybe it's just asking for the coefficient in the first part, which is 6, and the second part is just a factor. Wait, but that doesn't make sense either because the second part is multiplied into the first.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is intended to have the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, so it's just 6 times the entire expansion of the second part, which would mean the coefficient is \\(6 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would be a polynomial, not a single number. So, maybe the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and the second part is just a factor that's multiplied in, but since it's not affecting the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) exponents, the coefficient remains 6. But that doesn't seem right because when you multiply by the second part, you're effectively scaling the entire first polynomial by the second polynomial, which would affect all coefficients.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to clarify: when you have two polynomials multiplied together, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum of the products of the coefficients of terms in the first polynomial that multiply together to form that specific term. But in this case, since the second polynomial doesn't have any \\(a\\) or \\(b\\) terms, the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is by multiplying the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first polynomial by any term from the second polynomial. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial. Because each term in the second polynomial contributes its coefficient to the product when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\).\n\nSo, in this case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial is 6, and the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial is \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 * 64 = 384. That seems to be the case. Let me verify this with another example to make sure.\n\nSuppose I have \\((a + b)^1 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, expanding, we have \\((a + b)(c + 1/c)\\). The coefficient of \\(a\\) would be the coefficient of \\(a\\) in the first polynomial (which is 1) multiplied by the sum of coefficients in the second polynomial (which is 2), so 1 * 2 = 2. But in reality, the coefficient of \\(a\\) in the product is \\(c + 1/c\\), which is a polynomial, not 2. So, in this case, my approach would be incorrect because I'm treating the sum of coefficients as a scalar, but in reality, each term in the second polynomial contributes a coefficient that's multiplied by the first polynomial's terms.\n\nWait, so perhaps my initial approach is wrong. Let me think again. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. So, when I expand the product, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part, which is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the sum over all \\(k\\) of \\(6 \\times \\dbinom{6}{k}\\). Because each term in the second expansion contributes its coefficient to the product when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient would be \\(6 \\times \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k}\\). But the sum of binomial coefficients for \\(n = 6\\) is \\(2^6 = 64\\). So, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 384.\n\nWait, but in my earlier example, that approach didn't work because it gave a scalar instead of a polynomial. But in that example, the problem was that the coefficient of \\(a\\) would be a polynomial, not a scalar. So, perhaps the problem here is different because the question is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, in other words, the coefficient is a scalar that's multiplied by any power of \\(c\\). But that doesn't make sense because the coefficient is a scalar, and the term would be \\(384 a^2b^2\\), but that's not correct because each term in the second expansion has a different power of \\(c\\). So, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, which would be the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by 6. Therefore, the coefficient is 384.\n\nWait, but I'm confused because in the smaller example, this approach didn't work. Let me try to see where I'm going wrong. In the smaller example, \\((a + b)^1 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\), the coefficient of \\(a\\) would be \\(c + 1/c\\), which is a polynomial, not a scalar. So, in that case, the coefficient isn't a single number but a polynomial. But in the problem at hand, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient as a polynomial, but the way it's phrased is \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", which might imply that it's considering \\(a^2b^2\\) as a term, regardless of the \\(c\\) exponents. So, in that case, the coefficient would indeed be 384, as I calculated before.\n\nWait, but let me think again: when you have the product of two polynomials, the coefficient of a term like \\(a^2b^2\\) is the sum of all products of coefficients from each polynomial whose variables multiply to give \\(a^2b^2\\). But in this case, the second polynomial doesn't have any \\(a\\) or \\(b\\) terms, so the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) is by multiplying the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first polynomial by any term from the second polynomial. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial multiplied by the entire second polynomial. But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, not a scalar. So, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient as a polynomial, but the way it's phrased is unclear.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is intended to have the coefficient as a scalar, so maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me try to see if there's another way. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when considering the entire expression as a product, which would involve considering the exponents of \\(c\\) as well. But that doesn't make sense because the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some \\(k\\).\n\nWait, maybe I'm misinterpreting the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, perhaps the problem is treating the entire expression as a polynomial in \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\), and \\(1/c\\), and it's asking for the coefficient of the term \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the exponents of \\(c\\). In that case, the coefficient would indeed be the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part, which would be a polynomial. But the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, so perhaps I'm misunderstanding.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\), which is 1. So, in that case, I would need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\) in the product. That would make sense because it's a specific term. So, let me try that approach.\n\nSo, to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), I need to consider how \\(a^2b^2\\) can be formed in the first part and how \\(c^0\\) can be formed in the second part. The first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), has the term \\(a^2b^2\\) with coefficient 6. The second part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), has a term \\(c^0\\) when the exponents from \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) cancel out. So, in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term with \\(c^0\\) is when the exponents of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) multiply to give \\(c^0\\). That occurs when the number of \\(c\\) terms minus the number of \\(1/c\\) terms equals zero. So, if we have \\(k\\) terms of \\(1/c\\), then the exponent is \\(6 - 2k\\). Setting \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), we get \\(k = 3\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product would be the product of the coefficients from each part: 6 (from the first part) times 20 (from the second part), which is 120. So, the coefficient is 120.\n\nWait, that makes more sense. So, the problem was asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but considering that the entire expression is a product, and perhaps the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is accompanied by \\(c^0\\). So, the coefficient is 120. Let me check this approach with my earlier example to see if it makes sense.\n\nIn the smaller example: \\((a + b)^1 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^1\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be zero because the first part only goes up to \\(a^1b^1\\). But if I were to look for the coefficient of \\(ab c^0\\), that would be the coefficient of \\(ab\\) in the first part (which is 1) times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part (which is 2, since \\(\\dbinom{1}{0} + \\dbinom{1}{1} = 2\\)), but wait, no, in the second part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^1\\), the term \\(c^0\\) is when \\(k = 1\\), because \\(1 - 2k = 0\\) implies \\(k = 0.5\\), which isn't an integer, so there is no \\(c^0\\) term. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(ab c^0\\) would be zero, which makes sense.\n\nWait, but in the problem at hand, the second part does have a \\(c^0\\) term, so the coefficient is 20, and the first part's coefficient is 6, so 6 * 20 = 120. That seems correct.\n\nSo, to summarize, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 120 because we're considering the term where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out to \\(c^0\\), giving a numerical coefficient.\n\nWait, but I'm still a bit confused because earlier I thought the problem was asking for the coefficient regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, but now I'm interpreting it as asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). Let me make sure that's the correct interpretation. The problem says: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, it's possible that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which would mean that it's a scalar multiplied by some expression in \\(c\\). But that doesn't make sense because the coefficient is a scalar, not a polynomial. Therefore, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is a specific term, and that would be 120.\n\nWait, let me think again. The problem is phrased as asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but in the context of the entire product, which includes \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, without specifying the \\(c\\) exponent, it's ambiguous. But in most problems like this, when they ask for the coefficient of a term without specifying other variables, they usually mean the coefficient when considering all possible exponents of the other variables. So, in this case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the sum of all coefficients from the second part multiplied by the coefficient from the first part. That would give 6 * 64 = 384, as I calculated earlier. But then, in that case, the coefficient is a scalar, but when you multiply by the second part, it's actually a polynomial. So, perhaps the problem is intended to have the coefficient as a scalar, and it's only considering the \\(a^2b^2\\) term, ignoring the \\(c\\) terms. But that doesn't make sense because the product includes \\(c\\) terms.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is only considering \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) and treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the entire second part. So, the coefficient would be \\(6 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that's a polynomial, not a number. So, perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient in the first part, which is 6, and the second part is just a factor. But that doesn't make sense either because the problem includes both parts.\n\nWait, I'm getting more confused. Let me try to approach this differently. Maybe I can treat the entire expression as a product and find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) exponents. So, when you expand the product, each term will be of the form \\(a^k b^{4 - k} \\times \\text{something with } c\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so \\(k = 2\\), which gives \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part. The coefficient from the first part is 6, as before. Now, when you multiply this by the second part, which is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in the second part will be multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), resulting in terms like \\(6 \\times \\dbinom{6}{k} a^2b^2 c^{6 - 2k}\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the sum over all \\(k\\) of \\(6 \\times \\dbinom{6}{k}\\). But the sum of \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}\\) for \\(k = 0\\) to \\(6\\) is \\(2^6 = 64\\). So, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\nWait, but in this case, the coefficient is a scalar, but each term in the product has a different power of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is actually a polynomial in \\(c\\), not a scalar. Therefore, the problem must be asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is a specific term where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out. So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part, which is 20, giving 120.\n\nSo, I think the correct interpretation is that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. Therefore, the final answer is 120.\n\nWait, but let me make sure. Let me think of the entire product as a polynomial in \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\), and \\(1/c\\). The term \\(a^2b^2\\) can be combined with any power of \\(c\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, so perhaps it's only considering the part that's independent of \\(c\\), i.e., the constant term with respect to \\(c\\). So, that would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So, the answer is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is found by considering the product of the coefficient from the first binomial expansion and the coefficient of the constant term in the second binomial expansion.\n\n1. Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n2. Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) and find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\), which occurs when \\(k = 3\\), giving \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n3. Multiply these coefficients: \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

I'm not sure if I need to expand this part as well, but wait, the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, maybe I don't need to consider the \\(c\\) terms because \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\). Let me think: since the expression is the product of two separate binomials, \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are multiplied by the terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), perhaps the \\(c\\) terms don't affect this coefficient. That is, when we multiply the two expressions together, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part will be multiplied by each term from the second part, but since we're only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), the \\(c\\) part can be anything because \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\). Wait, but that doesn't seem right. Let me think again. When we multiply two expressions, every term in the first expression is multiplied by every term in the second expression. So, if I have \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, it will be multiplied by each term in the second part, which is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually be multiplied by all the terms from the second expansion, each of which has some power of \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term without any \\(c\\)s. So, does that mean that only the constant term in the second expansion (i.e., the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero) would contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)? Because if we have any other term with \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), then the product would have \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2 \\cdot 1/c^k\\), which would not be just \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the only way to get a term that is exactly \\(a^2b^2\\) is when we multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by the constant term in the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the coefficient of the constant term in the second part. \n\nSo, I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me expand that using the binomial theorem as well. So, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, so we set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\), which is \\(\\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). \n\nNow, putting it all together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficients from each part. That is, 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the second part), which gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). \n\nWait, let me double-check that. So, the first part gives \\(a^2b^2\\) with coefficient 6, and the second part's constant term is 20. So, when we multiply these together, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is indeed \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). \n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of the entire expression as a product of two expansions. So, the first expansion gives terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the second gives terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). Since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are different variables, the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) don't interact with those of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just the product of the coefficients from each expansion for \\(a^2b^2\\) and the constant term in the second expansion. So, yes, that makes sense. \n\nI think I've got it right. So, the coefficient is 120.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break it down into two parts:\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\)** using the binomial theorem.

This occurs at \\(m = 3\\), giving a coefficient of \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n\nMultiplying these coefficients together: \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

Because each \\(m\\) contributes \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\) to the coefficient. So, that sum is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} = 2^6 = 64\\).

Solving \\(6 - 2m = 0\\) gives \\(m = 3\\). The constant term is:\n\\[\n\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\n\\]\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is the product of the coefficients from each part:\n\\[\n6 \\times 20 = 120\n\\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}."

    "text": " So, the coefficient is 6. \n\nNow, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But the problem is only asking about the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Hmm, does that mean I need to consider the entire expression, or just the part from \\((a + b)^4\\)? Wait, no, because the expression is a product of two parts. So, when you multiply two expressions, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and the second part involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), which don't have \\(a\\) or \\(b\\) in them, the terms from the second part won't affect the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would just be the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but actually, when you multiply, each term from the first part is multiplied by each term from the second part, but since we're only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and the second part doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the entire second part. But wait, that doesn't seem right because the second part is raised to the 6th power, which would have multiple terms. Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again.\n\nWait, no. Actually, when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficients of the terms in the product are the products of the coefficients of the terms from each polynomial. But in this case, the first polynomial is \\((a + b)^4\\), and the second is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\), and \\(1/c\\) are different variables, the only way \\(a^2b^2\\) can appear in the product is by taking \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part and any term from the second part, because \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Wait, no, that's not quite accurate. Because when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, if I have \\( (a^2b^2) \\times (c^6 + \\text{other terms}) \\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, but since the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), maybe I'm misunderstanding. Wait, no, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, when you expand this, the terms will be of the form \\(a^kb^{4 - k} \\times c^m \\times (1/c)^{6 - m}\\), right? Because each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is of the form \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\times (1/c)^m = \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). Wait, no, actually, when you expand \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\times (1/c)^m = \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\) where \\(m\\) ranges from 0 to 6.\n\nBut since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), I think that the only way for the product to have \\(a^2b^2\\) is if we take \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part and multiply it by a term in the second part that is \\(c^0\\), i.e., a constant term. Because if we take any other term from the second part, it will have a power of \\(c\\), which would make the product have \\(a^2b^2c^{something}\\), but the problem is only asking for \\(a^2b^2\\), so the exponent of \\(c\\) must be zero. Therefore, the coefficient would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part.\n\nWait, that makes sense. So, first, find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, as I found earlier. Then, find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is the constant term. Let me calculate that. So, in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\times (1/c)^m = \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We want the exponent of \\(c\\) to be zero, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nWait, but let me double-check. So, the coefficient from the first part is 6, and the coefficient from the second part is 20, so 6 times 20 is 120. That seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider that the entire expression is a product, so each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But since we're looking for the term \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) part, we can think of it as the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Wait, no, that's not correct because the second part isn't a constant; it's a polynomial in \\(c\\). So, when you multiply, each term in the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the sum of all coefficients in the second part. But that would be incorrect because the sum of all coefficients in the second part is \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\), which would make the coefficient 6 \u00d7 64 = 384, which is way too big. So, that approach is wrong.\n\nWait, no, I think the correct approach is that since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a specific term not involving \\(c\\), so in the product, the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) is to multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part by the constant term from the second part. Because if you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by any other term from the second part, you'll end up with \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some \\(k\\), which is not the term we're interested in. Therefore, the coefficient is indeed 6 \u00d7 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\), and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15/c^2 + 6/c^4 + 1/c^6\\). So, when I multiply these two, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second part, resulting in terms like \\(6a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(6a^2b^2c^4\\), etc. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). Wait, no, actually, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which implies that it's looking for the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2 each, but the exponent of \\(c\\) can be anything. Wait, no, that's not correct. Because in the product, each term is a combination of \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\). So, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), it's likely that it's looking for the coefficient of the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any term from the second part, regardless of the \\(c\\) exponent. But that doesn't make sense because the problem would then be asking for the sum of all coefficients where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any term in the second expansion, which would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 \u00d7 64 = 384, as I thought earlier. But that seems too large, and also, I think the problem is more likely asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, meaning that it's looking for the coefficient when \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\), i.e., the constant term. So, that would be 6 \u00d7 20 = 120.\n\nWait, perhaps I should clarify. The problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\". In the product \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term is of the form \\(a^kb^{4 - k} \\times c^{m} \\times (1/c)^{6 - m}\\), which simplifies to \\(a^kb^{4 - k}c^{2m - 6}\\). So, the exponent of \\(c\\) is \\(2m - 6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would have \\(k = 2\\), so the term is \\(6a^2b^2 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But wait, no, that's not right. Because when you multiply, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part, which includes \\(c^6\\), \\(6c^4\\), \\(15c^2\\), \\(20\\), \\(15/c^2\\), \\(6/c^4\\), and \\(1/c^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by all these terms, resulting in terms like \\(6a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(36a^2b^2c^4\\), etc., but none of these are \\(a^2b^2\\) alone. The only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms is if we multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by the constant term in the second part, which is 20. So, the coefficient would be 6 \u00d7 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but that would mean that in the entire product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is only present as \\(120a^2b^2\\), because all other terms would have \\(c\\) exponents. So, the coefficient is 120.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be 120. But if it's just asking for \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, then the coefficient would be 120, because that's the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) attached. So, I think that's the correct approach.\n\nSo, to summarize, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 20, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 \u00d7 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but let me check if I'm not missing something. Suppose I consider the entire expansion, then the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by all terms in the second expansion, but the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would include all those terms. But that can't be, because each of those would be separate terms with different exponents of \\(c\\). So, perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) exponent, meaning that it's looking for the sum of all coefficients where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present, regardless of the \\(c\\) part. But that would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 \u00d7 64 = 384, as I thought earlier. But that seems too high, and I think the problem is more likely asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by the constant term in the second expansion, which is 120. So, I think the correct answer is 120.\n\nWait, perhaps I should think about it differently. Let me consider that when you multiply two expressions, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each expression. But in this case, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is only present in the first expression, and the second expression doesn't have \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), so the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is by taking \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expression and multiplying it by any term from the second expression, regardless of the \\(c\\) exponent. Therefore, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expression. The sum of all coefficients in the second expression is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient would be 6 \u00d7 64 = 384. But that seems too large, and I'm not sure if that's what the problem is asking for. The problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", which might imply that it's looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times any term in the second expression, which would indeed be 384. But I'm a bit confused because the problem could be interpreted in two ways: either it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) exponent, or it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nWait, let me read the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, it's just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), without specifying anything about \\(c\\). Therefore, in the product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) can be multiplied by any term from the second expression, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), etc. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would include all those terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present, regardless of the power of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient would be the sum of all coefficients where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any term in the second expression. So, that would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expression, which is 6 \u00d7 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but that doesn't seem right because if you think about it, each term in the product would be \\(a^kb^{4 - k} \\times c^{m} \\times (1/c)^{6 - m}\\), so the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be present in the product as \\(6a^2b^2 \\times \\left(c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15/c^2 + 6/c^4 + 1/c^6\\right)\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 multiplied by each coefficient in the second expression, but since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), that would mean adding up all those terms. So, the coefficient would be 6 \u00d7 (sum of coefficients in the second expression). The sum of coefficients in the second expression is found by substituting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 \u00d7 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was 120. So, which is correct? Let me clarify. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. So, in the product, each term is a product of a term from the first expression and a term from the second. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expression is multiplied by each term in the second expression, resulting in terms like \\(6a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(36a^2b^2c^4\\), etc. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the sum of all coefficients from the second expression multiplied by 6. So, that would be 6 \u00d7 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but that seems to contradict my earlier reasoning where I thought it was 120. So, which is it? Let me think again. If the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then it's 384. If it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it's 120. But the problem doesn't specify anything about \\(c\\), so I think it's the former, 384. But I'm not entirely sure. Let me check an example.\n\nSuppose I have \\((a + b)^1 \\times (c + 1/c)^1 = (a + b)(c + 1/c)\\). The expansion would be \\(ac + a/c + bc + b/c\\). Now, the coefficient of \\(a\\) would be \\(c + 1/c\\), but if we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a\\) regardless of \\(c\\), it's not straightforward because each term has a different power of \\(c\\). So, perhaps in that case, the problem would be asking for the coefficient of \\(a c^k\\) for some \\(k\\), but since it's not specified, maybe it's not possible. Therefore, perhaps the problem is intended to ask for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be 120. Alternatively, maybe the problem is only considering the part \\((a + b)^4\\) and ignoring the second part, but that doesn't make sense because the entire expression is given.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. But in reality, each term in the product is a combination of \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\), so the term \\(a^2b^2\\) alone isn't present unless multiplied by a term that cancels out the \\(c\\) exponents. But in the product, the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) is by multiplying \\(a^2b^2\\) by the constant term in the second expression. Therefore, the coefficient is 6 \u00d7 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but that's only if we're looking for \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). If the problem is just asking for \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) exponent, then the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expression, which is 6 \u00d7 64 = 384. But I'm not sure which interpretation is correct.\n\nLet me try to find similar problems or think about how such problems are usually phrased. Typically, when a problem asks for the coefficient of a specific term in a product of expressions, it's referring to the term where the variables match exactly, meaning that any variables not present in the specified term should have zero exponents. So, in this case, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would imply that \\(c\\) should also have an exponent of zero, so we're looking for \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). Therefore, the coefficient would be 6 \u00d7 20 = 120.\n\nYes, that makes more sense. So, the correct coefficient is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by considering the binomial expansions of each part. \n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\):**  \n   Using the binomial theorem, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) has a coefficient of \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n\n2. **Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**  \n   The constant term (where \\(c^0\\)) is found when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), giving \\(m = 3\\).

    "text": " So, the coefficient is 6. \n\nNow, the expression also has another part: \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Hmm, I notice that this part involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), but since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), maybe I don't need to expand this part fully. Wait, but actually, the entire expression is the product of \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when we multiply them, each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), that means we need to find the term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) that has \\(c^0\\), because \\(c^0 = 1\\), and multiplying by that won't change the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. So, the term we need from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is the constant term, the one where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. \n\nLet me think about how to find that. Using the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying the exponents, that becomes \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m} = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, so we set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(6 = 2m\\) => \\(m = 3\\). So, the term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} c^{0} = \\dbinom{6}{3}\\).

Hmm, I think not directly, because \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, when you multiply two expressions, the coefficients multiply if you're looking for specific terms. But in this case, since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are in one part and \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) are in the other, maybe the coefficients are independent. Wait, but actually, the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of what happens with the \\(c\\) terms. So, does that mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just 6, and the rest of the terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) don't affect it? Hmm, let me think again. When you multiply two polynomials together, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. So, if I have \\((a + b)^4\\) times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\), and \\(1/c\\) are all different variables, the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from those involving \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, does that mean that the coefficient is just 6, and the \\(c\\) terms contribute a factor that's multiplied by 6, but since we're only interested in the \\(a^2b^2\\) term, the \\(c\\) part doesn't affect it? Hmm, that doesn't seem right because the entire expression is a product, so the coefficients would be multiplied. Wait, no, because \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term in the first part, and the second part is multiplied by it, so the coefficient would be 6 times whatever the entire second part is. But wait, no, because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, perhaps it's just 6, and the rest of the terms involving \\(c\\) are separate. Alternatively, maybe the problem is considering the entire expression as a polynomial in multiple variables, and it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), because otherwise, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by various powers of \\(c\\), and the coefficient would vary depending on the power of \\(c\\). Hmm, that makes more sense. So, maybe I need to consider the term \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by \\(c^0\\), which is the term where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out. So, in that case, I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, which would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, now I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me think about that. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) can be done using the binomial theorem as well. So, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so we set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the second part), which is 6 * 20 = 120. Wait, but let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. So, the original expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). When I expand both, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first expansion, and it's multiplied by every term in the second expansion. So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, then the coefficient would be 6 times the entire second expansion, which is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would include all the terms multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), but since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term in the first part, and the second part is a separate polynomial, the coefficient would actually be 6 times the entire second polynomial. But that doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a specific coefficient, not an expression. So, perhaps I misinterpreted the problem. Maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\). In that case, the coefficient would be 6 times 20, which is 120, as I calculated before. Alternatively, if the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, then the coefficient would be 6 times the entire second polynomial, but that seems unlikely because the problem is probably expecting a numerical coefficient. So, I think the intended interpretation is that we need the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. Let me check that again. So, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. In \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Therefore, when you multiply these two parts, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by the term \\(c^0\\), which has a coefficient of 20, so the total coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120. Yes, that makes sense. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Next, we find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying these coefficients together gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\boxed{120}."

    "text": " So, the term is \\(6a^2b^2\\). Okay, so that's the first part. Now, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I need to consider the product of these two expansions. But wait, since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which comes from the first part, and since the second part involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), which don't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), maybe the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. But wait, no, actually, the entire expression is a product of two polynomials. So, when you multiply them, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. However, since the second polynomial only involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), and the first part only involves \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) won't be affected by the \\(c\\) terms.

Wait, but that doesn't make sense because then the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\), not a constant. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term in the product. Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When we expand this, each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would be the sum of all the products where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any term from the second expansion. Wait, no, that's not right. Because \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term in the first part, and when you multiply it by the entire second part, it becomes \\(6a^2b^2 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so it's just 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that seems like a polynomial in \\(c\\), not a constant. Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). But that doesn't make much sense because the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, which would include all possible terms involving \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some \\(k\\). But that's not what the problem is asking. Wait, let me read the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" Hmm, so perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when considering the entire product, treating \\(c\\) as an independent variable. But that would mean that the coefficient is actually a polynomial in \\(c\\). But that seems odd because the problem is phrased as if it's a single coefficient. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). But that would mean adding up all the coefficients of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for all \\(k\\), which would be the same as multiplying the coefficient from the first part by the sum of the coefficients from the second part. Wait, but the second part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which when expanded, has terms with different powers of \\(c\\). So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), it would be 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that can't be right because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, not an expression in \\(c\\). So, perhaps I'm misinterpreting the problem. Maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), that is, the term where the exponents of \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are 2, 2, and 0, respectively. That would make sense because then the coefficient would be a number. So, perhaps the problem is implicitly asking for the coefficient where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\), meaning the constant term in the second expansion. So, to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, we need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). That makes sense. So, let's break it down. The first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), has a term \\(6a^2b^2\\). The second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), has a term that is \\(c^0\\), which is the constant term. So, we need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), and then multiply it by 6 to get the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is the same as \\(a^2b^2\\). So, first, let's find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). To do that, we can use the binomial theorem again. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, the general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, which means solving \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). So, \\(2k = 6\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\). So, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire product is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120.\n\nWait, let me double-check that. So, the first part gives us 6 for \\(a^2b^2\\), and the second part gives us 20 for the constant term. Multiplying them together gives 120. That seems correct. Alternatively, if I consider that the entire expression is a product, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would indeed be the product of the coefficients from each part where the exponents match, which in this case, since \\(c\\) is involved, we need the constant term from the second part. So, yes, 6 times 20 is 120. I think that's the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem.\n\nFirst, we expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n\\]\nThe term containing \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\):\n\\[\n\\dbinom{4}{2} a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\n\\]\nSo, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\nNext, we consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):\n\\[\n\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n\\]\nWe need the constant term, which occurs when the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0:\n\\[\n6 - 2k = 0 \\implies k = 3\n\\]\nThe constant term is:\n\\[\n\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\n\\]\n\nMultiplying the coefficient from the first part by the constant term from the second part gives:\n\\[\n6 \\times 20 = 120\n\\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me reread it: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, the entire expression is a product of two binomials, each raised to a power. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), and the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), would contribute terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), perhaps we need to consider all possible terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any term from the second expansion. Wait, but that would mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that can't be right because the problem is asking for a specific term, not the sum. Wait, no, perhaps not. Let me think again. When you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum of the products of the coefficients of terms whose variables multiply to give that specific term. So, in this case, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial is multiplied by every term in the second polynomial, which is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 (the coefficient from the first part) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. But wait, the second expansion, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), when expanded, has terms like \\(c^6\\), \\(6c^4\\), \\(15c^2\\), \\(20\\), \\(15c^{-2}\\), \\(6c^{-4}\\), \\(c^{-6}\\). So, the sum of all coefficients would be when \\(c = 1\\), which would give \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of all coefficients is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 * 64 = 384. But wait, that seems too straightforward. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), which would be 6 multiplied by each coefficient from the second expansion, but since we're considering all possible powers of \\(c\\), the total coefficient would be 6 * 64 = 384. But wait, let me check that again. Alternatively, perhaps I'm supposed to consider only the constant term in the second expansion, but no, the problem doesn't specify any condition on \\(c\\), so I think it's correct that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but actually, no. Let me clarify. When you have two polynomials multiplied together, the coefficient of a specific term is the sum of the products of the coefficients of terms whose variables multiply to give that term. In this case, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial is multiplied by every term in the second polynomial, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would indeed be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial. Since the second polynomial, when evaluated at \\(c = 1\\), gives the sum of its coefficients, which is \\(2^6 = 64\\), then yes, the coefficient would be 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nBut wait, let me make sure. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times the constant term, but no, the problem doesn't specify any condition on \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but another way to think about it is that since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term independent of \\(c\\), the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider that the second expansion has terms with different powers of \\(c\\), but since \\(a^2b^2\\) is independent of \\(c\\), the coefficient would just be 6 times the entire sum of coefficients from the second expansion. So, yes, 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me confirm this approach. Suppose I have two expressions, P(a, b) and Q(c). The coefficient of a specific term in P(a, b) * Q(c) is the coefficient of that term in P(a, b) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in Q(c). Because when you multiply P(a, b) by Q(c), each term in P(a, b) is multiplied by each term in Q(c). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in P(a, b) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in Q(c). So, in this case, that would be 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nBut let me check with an example. Suppose I have (a + b)^1 * (c + 1/c)^1. Then, the coefficient of a^2b^2 would be zero because in (a + b)^1, the highest power is a^1b^0 and a^0b^1. But wait, that's a bad example. Let me take (a + b)^2 * (c + 1/c)^1. The coefficient of a^2b^0 would be 1 (from (a + b)^2) multiplied by (c + 1/c), so the coefficient would be 1*(1 + 1) = 2. Similarly, the coefficient of a^0b^2 would also be 1*(1 + 1) = 2. So, in that case, the coefficient of a^2b^0 is 2, which is indeed 1 (from the first part) times 2 (sum of coefficients in the second part). So, yes, that seems to work.\n\nTherefore, applying the same logic, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) would be 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in calculating the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). The sum of coefficients is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), so \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\), which is correct. So, 6 * 64 = 384. Therefore, the coefficient is 384.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Is there another way to approach this problem? For example, maybe using multinomial coefficients or considering the entire expansion. But I think the approach I took is correct. The key is that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part because every term in the second part is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), so the coefficient accumulates all those contributions.\n\nSo, to recap: The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 64. Therefore, the coefficient in the product is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nI think that makes sense. I don't see any mistakes in the reasoning. So, the final answer should be 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is found using the binomial theorem, which gives 6. The sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 64. Multiplying these gives \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\boxed{384}."

However, since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), I think we need to find the term in the second expansion where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero because \\(c^0 = 1\\), which doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. So, I need to find the value of \\(m\\) such that \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Let me solve for \\(m\\): \\(6 - 2m = 0\\) \u2192 \\(2m = 6\\) \u2192 \\(m = 3\\). So, the term where \\(m = 3\\) in the second expansion will give me \\(c^0\\), which is 1. The coefficient for that term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion is 20. Therefore, when I multiply the two expansions together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) will be the product of the coefficients from each expansion. That is, 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the second part). So, 6 \u00d7 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120. Wait, let me just double-check that. So, in the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6. In the second part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term with \\(c^0\\) is when \\(m = 3\\), and the coefficient is 20. So, multiplying them together gives 6 \u00d7 20 = 120. Yeah, that seems right. I don't think I made a mistake here. So, the final answer should be 120.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\):\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} a^{2}b^{2} = 6a^2b^2\n   \\]\n   So, the coefficient is 6.\n\n2. **Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n   \\]\n   We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0:\n   \\[\n   6 - 2m = 0 \\implies m = 3\n   \\]\n   The coefficient is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\n   \\]\n\n3. **Multiply the coefficients from both expansions:**\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 20 = 120\n   \\]\n\n**Final Answer:** The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

    "text": " So, the term is \\(6a^2b^2\\). \n\nNow, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I need to consider both parts together. But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is part of the first binomial expansion. The second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), when expanded, will have terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), the \\(c\\) terms might not affect it, right? Because \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\) at all. So, maybe the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just the same as the coefficient from the first part, multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. But wait, that doesn't make sense because when you multiply two expressions, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient from the first part, \\(6\\), multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part, but since we're only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), maybe the second part contributes a factor that doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. So, perhaps the coefficient remains 6 regardless of the second part. Wait, but that seems too straightforward. Let me think again. \n\nWait, no, because the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), when expanded, will have terms with different powers of \\(c\\), but since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), perhaps we're only considering the constant term in the second expansion, which is when the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out. So, in the second part, the constant term is the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. Let me calculate that. \n\nSo, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) can be expanded using the binomial theorem as well: \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which implies \\(m = 3\\). So, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). \n\nTherefore, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), and when we multiply them, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the constant term from the second expansion. So, that would be \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). \n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not missing anything. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so in the product of the two expansions, each term from the first expansion is multiplied by each term from the second. However, since we're only interested in terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) appears, the \\(c\\) terms must be such that they don't affect \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). So, in other words, the coefficient is indeed the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and the constant term in the second part. So, 6 times 20 is 120. \n\nWait, but maybe I should check this more carefully. Let me write out the expansions more explicitly. \n\nFirst, \\((a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6. \n\nNow, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) expands to terms involving \\(c^6, c^4, c^2, 1, c^{-2}, c^{-4}, c^{-6}\\), etc., with coefficients given by the binomial coefficients. As calculated earlier, the constant term is when \\(m = 3\\), which gives \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). \n\nSo, when we multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, we need to consider all terms where the \\(c\\) exponents are zero because only then will the term contribute to \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the only term that contributes is \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by the constant term 20. Therefore, the coefficient is 6 times 20, which is 120. \n\nWait, but let me think again. If I have \\( (a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 \\), then when I expand it, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the first part, and it's multiplied by every term in the second part. However, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\). So, in the entire product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be present as \\(a^2b^2 \\times \\text{(some expression in c)}\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, that is, the coefficient when the \\(c\\) terms are multiplied, but actually, no, because the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\). Wait, but that's not possible because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by the entire second expression, you get \\(a^2b^2 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which includes terms with \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, the only way \\(a^2b^2\\) can be a standalone term is if it's multiplied by the constant term in the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6 times 20, which is 120. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, and since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the only way that term can appear is if it's multiplied by the constant term in the second expansion. So, the coefficient is 6 times 20, which is 120. \n\nWait, but another way to think about it is that when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term is the sum of the products of the coefficients of terms that multiply together to give that specific term. So, in this case, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) can only come from the product of \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part and the constant term from the second part because any other term from the second part would introduce a \\(c\\) term, which would make the overall term have \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), which isn't part of \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient is 6 times 20, which is 120. \n\nSo, after all that, I think the coefficient is 120. \n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem for both parts of the expression.\n\nFirst, we expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n\\]\nWe are interested in the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2.

But since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) has a coefficient, and when you multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), each of those coefficients becomes a coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) times that term. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, we can think of it as the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all coefficients from the second part. Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Maybe the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is just the coefficient from the first part times the entire expansion of the second part, but since the second part doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is simply the coefficient from the first part times the entire second polynomial. Wait, but that doesn't make sense because the second polynomial has terms with \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), which are separate variables. So, perhaps the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the same as in the first polynomial, multiplied by the entire expansion of the second, but since we're only looking for the coefficient, not the entire term, it's just the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all coefficients from the second part. Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me think again. \n\nThe original expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When you expand this, you'll have terms like \\(a^kb^{4 - k}\\) multiplied by terms like \\(c^m (1/c)^{6 - m}\\), which simplifies to \\(a^kb^{4 - k}c^{m - (6 - m)} = a^kb^{4 - k}c^{2m - 6}\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, in the product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will come from multiplying the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in \\((a + b)^4\\) by every term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) has a coefficient, say \\(C\\), and when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by \\(C\\), you get \\(C a^2b^2\\), so the total coefficient is the sum of all such \\(C\\). Therefore, I need to calculate the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and then multiply it by the sum of all coefficients in the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nNow, how do I find the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)? Well, the sum of coefficients in a polynomial is found by setting all variables to 1. So, if I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = (1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of all coefficients in the second part is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). \n\nWait, but let me verify that. Is the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) really 64? Let me think. When \\(c = 1\\), yes, because \\(c + 1/c = 2\\), so \\(2^6 = 64\\). So, that seems correct. Therefore, the coefficient is 6 times 64, which is 384. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I should approach it differently. Let me consider the entire expansion. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, as I found. Then, when I multiply by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is a coefficient times some power of \\(c\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) contributes its coefficient to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the total coefficient is 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nWait, but another way to think about it is that when you have two polynomials multiplied together, the coefficient of a specific term in one polynomial is multiplied by the entire other polynomial. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is indeed the coefficient from the first polynomial times the entire second polynomial, but since we're only interested in the coefficient, not the variables, we just take the coefficient times the sum of the coefficients of the second polynomial. So, that's consistent with what I did earlier. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of it as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the product of the coefficients from each part, but that doesn't seem right because the variables are separate. Wait, no, actually, when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a term is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each polynomial. But in this case, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the first polynomial, and the second polynomial doesn't have any \\(a\\) or \\(b\\) terms, so each term in the second polynomial is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), effectively making the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product equal to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial. \n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not missing something. Suppose I have two polynomials, P(a, b) and Q(c). Then, P(a, b) * Q(c) would have terms where each term in P is multiplied by each term in Q. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in P(a, b) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in Q(c), because each term in Q(c) is a coefficient times some power of c, and when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), it becomes \\(a^2b^2\\) times that coefficient. So, the total coefficient is indeed the product of the two coefficients. \n\nTherefore, I think my initial approach is correct. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 64, so the total coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nBut just to be thorough, let me consider expanding \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem. So, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). The sum of all coefficients is when we set \\(c = 1\\), which gives us \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\), as I found earlier. So, that's consistent. \n\nTherefore, I'm confident that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is found using the binomial theorem: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). The sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is calculated by setting \\(c = 1\\), giving \\(2^6 = 64\\). Multiplying these results gives the final coefficient: \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n\\boxed{384}"

So, I need to consider both parts. However, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\). That means, when multiplying the two parts together, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part will multiply with the constant term (if there is one) from the second part, or maybe it will multiply with other terms, but since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't have \\(c\\), the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would just be the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part. So, I think I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nLet me work on that. Using the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\).

So, set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), I get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20. \n\nNow, going back to the original expression. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20.

So, when you multiply these two parts together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by 20, giving a total coefficient of \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). \n\nI think that's correct. Let me just recap: The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6, and the constant term in the second part is 20.

But since we're only interested in \\(a^2b^2\\), which is independent of \\(c\\), the only relevant term from the second expansion is the constant term, which is 20.

    "text": " So, the coefficient is 6.\n\nBut wait, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I also need to consider the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But hold on, the problem is only asking about the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which are terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). The second part of the expression involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), so when I multiply the two expansions together, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will be multiplied by every term from the second expansion. However, since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and not any specific term involving \\(c\\), I think I might need to clarify if the question wants the coefficient considering all possible terms from the second expansion or just the part from the first expansion. Wait, maybe I misread the problem. Let me check again: it says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\" in the entire product. So, that means when I multiply the two expressions, I'm looking for all the terms where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2 each, regardless of the exponents of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient would be the coefficient from the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, multiplied by the sum of all coefficients from the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because when you multiply by each term in the second expansion, you're effectively scaling the \\(a^2b^2\\) term by each coefficient in the second expansion. But wait, that doesn't sound right. Because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\). So, actually, when you multiply the two expressions, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion will be multiplied by every term in the second expansion, which includes \\(c^6\\), \\(c^4\\), \\(c^2\\), \\(c^0\\), \\(c^{-2}\\), \\(c^{-4}\\), \\(c^{-6}\\), each with their own coefficients. However, the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would mean that it's just the coefficient from the first expansion, because when you multiply by the second expansion, which has terms with \\(c\\), the resulting term would have \\(a^2b^2\\) times each of those \\(c\\) terms. But since the problem is only interested in \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), the coefficient would be the coefficient from the first expansion multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. Because each term in the second expansion contributes a coefficient that scales the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. So, the total coefficient would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Now, to find the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, I can substitute \\(c = 1\\). Because substituting \\(c = 1\\) into \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) gives \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 multiplied by 64, which is 384. Wait, but let me think again. Is that correct? Because when I multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, each term is a coefficient times a power of \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\). So, actually, I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, which would be the coefficient from the first part times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part. Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by \\(c^0\\) (which is 1), you get \\(a^2b^2\\). All other terms would involve powers of \\(c\\), so they wouldn't contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, I think I made a mistake earlier. The correct approach is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion, which is 6, and then multiply it by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion, which is the middle term of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me calculate that. Using the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\). So, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion is 20. So, the total coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the second part), which equals 120. So, the final answer should be 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is found by multiplying the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\n1. From \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n2. From \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n3. Multiply these coefficients: \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

    "text": " So, that part is clear. Now, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but the question is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). That makes me think: does the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), affect the coefficients of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\)? Or does it only affect the coefficients of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\)? Hmm, I think it's the latter because when you multiply two expressions, the variables multiply as well. So, if I have \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part and then multiply it by something involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), the resulting term will have \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by some power of \\(c\\). But the question is only about the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). Wait, no, actually, no. Wait, no, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but in the entire expression. So, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. Let me read the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" Wait, so maybe the term \\(a^2b^2\\) can have any power of \\(c\\), but we're only interested in the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) part. Hmm, but that seems a bit odd because \\(a^2b^2\\) is a separate term from the \\(c\\) terms. Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, in that case, the coefficient would just be the same as in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but since we're only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), maybe it's just 6 times whatever the expansion of the second part is. Wait, no, that doesn't make sense because the second part is multiplied by the first part. So, when you expand the entire expression, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which comes from the first part, and when multiplied by the second part, which is in terms of \\(c\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by each term from the second expansion. So, perhaps the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all terms in the second part. Wait, but that doesn't seem right because each term in the second part is a different power of \\(c\\). So, maybe the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that can't be right because we're looking for a specific coefficient, not an expression. Hmm, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some \\(k\\), but the problem just says \\(a^2b^2\\), without any \\(c\\) terms. So, perhaps it's considering all possible terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present, regardless of the power of \\(c\\), and summing their coefficients. But that would mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) would be when we set \\(c = 1\\), so substituting \\(c = 1\\) into \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 * 64 = 384. But that seems high. Wait, let me think again. Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6, as from \\((a + b)^4\\), and since the other part is multiplied by that, the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of the second part, but that doesn't make sense because each term would have different powers of \\(c\\). Wait, perhaps the problem is only considering the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), so the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. But that would mean 6 * 64 = 384, as I thought before. But I'm not sure if that's the correct interpretation. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), meaning the term where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out. That would make more sense. So, if I'm looking for the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\), then I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), and then multiply that by the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6. So, let's see. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is given by the binomial theorem as \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which implies \\(k = 3\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire expression would be \\(6 * 20 = 120\\). So, that's probably the answer. Wait, but let me check again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. So, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). In \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term where \\(c^0\\) occurs is when \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), so \\(k = 3\\), and the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, when you multiply the two parts together, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by the term \\(c^0\\) from the second part, which has a coefficient of 20. So, the total coefficient for \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) would be 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120. Alternatively, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, meaning summing over all possible \\(c\\) exponents, then the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. But the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is when \\(c = 1\\), which is \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\), so 6 * 64 = 384. But I think the more likely scenario is that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be 120. Let me see if that makes sense. So, the problem is phrased as \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", without specifying any \\(c\\) terms, so perhaps it's considering the term where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out, i.e., \\(c^0\\), so that the term is just \\(a^2b^2\\). So, I think 120 is the correct answer. Let me just recap: \\((a + b)^4\\) gives \\(a^2b^2\\) with coefficient 6. \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) gives \\(c^0\\) with coefficient 20. Multiply them together, 6 * 20 = 120. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120.\n\nWait, but let me check once more to be sure. Another way to think about it is that when you multiply two polynomials, each term from the first polynomial is multiplied by each term from the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\), and when multiplied by any term from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), it would result in \\(a^2b^2\\) times some power of \\(c\\). So, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, then it's 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. But if it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it's 6 * 20 = 120. Since the problem didn't specify any \\(c\\) term, I think it's more likely that it's asking for \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), so 384. Wait, but that seems contradictory because in the expansion, each term would have a specific power of \\(c\\), so \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by \\(c^k\\) for various \\(k\\). So, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), i.e., the term where \\(c\\) cancels out. So, in that case, it's 120. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, meaning that for each term in the expansion, if it has \\(a^2b^2\\), then sum all their coefficients. But that would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. But I'm not sure which interpretation is correct. Let me try to look at the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, in the product, each term will be of the form \\(a^kb^{4 - k}c^m\\), where \\(k\\) is from 0 to 4 and \\(m\\) is some exponent from the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would have \\(k=2\\), so \\(a^2b^2\\), and then multiplied by some \\(c^m\\) term. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^m\\) would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} \\times \\dbinom{6}{k}\\) where \\(k\\) is such that \\(m = 6 - 2k\\). But the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), without specifying \\(c\\), which is a bit ambiguous. If it's asking for all terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present, regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. But if it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it's 6 * 20 = 120. I think the more likely intended interpretation is the latter, because otherwise, the problem would have specified that it's looking for the coefficient regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, I think the answer is 120. Let me just confirm with an example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). Then, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15/c^2 + 6/c^4 + 1/c^6\\). So, when I multiply these together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^6\\) would be 6 * 1 = 6, \\(a^2b^2c^4\\) would be 6 * 6 = 36, \\(a^2b^2c^2\\) would be 6 * 15 = 90, \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) would be 6 * 20 = 120, and so on. So, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), it's 120. If it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), then it's the sum of all coefficients when \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term, which would be 6*(1 + 6 + 15 + 20 + 15 + 6 + 1) = 6*64 = 384. But since the problem didn't specify, I think it's more likely that it's asking for the term where \\(c^0\\) is present, so the answer is 120.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break down the problem into two parts using the binomial theorem.\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\):**\n   Using the binomial theorem, the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is:\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\), so the coefficient is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\n   \\]\n\n2. **Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   Similarly, using the binomial theorem:\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n   \\]\n   We are interested in the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, i.e., \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\).

    "text": " So, the coefficient is 6, and the term is \\(6a^2b^2\\). \n\nNow, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I have to consider the product of two expansions: the first part we just dealt with, and the second part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression. Wait, but \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are variables separate from \\(c\\). So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part, because \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) don't appear in the second part. So, in other words, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is just the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times whatever constant factor comes from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nWait, is that right? Let me think again. So, when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each polynomial, but only when the variables multiply to give that term. But in this case, the first polynomial is in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the second is in \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, when you multiply them, the variables \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are all independent. Therefore, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) can only come from the product of the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first polynomial and any term in the second polynomial. But since the second polynomial doesn't have any \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), all the terms in the second polynomial are constants with respect to \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, no, that doesn't make sense because the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is a polynomial in \\(c\\), and when you multiply it by \\(a^2b^2\\), each term in the second expansion would multiply \\(a^2b^2\\), but since we're just looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term without \\(c\\), that would require the second expansion to contribute a constant term, right? Because otherwise, the product would have terms with \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), but we're only interested in the term where the variables are \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), which is just a constant. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is equal to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nSo, I need to find two things:\n1. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which I already found to be 6.\n2. The constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nThen, the final coefficient will be the product of these two numbers.\n\nAlright, let's tackle the second part: finding the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Again, I can use the binomial theorem here. The expansion is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k\\). Simplifying the exponents, that becomes \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k - k} = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). \n\nWe are looking for the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, because that's the constant term. So, set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is when \\(k = 3\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} c^{0} = \\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Let me compute that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20.\n\nNow, putting it all together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the second part). So, 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient is 120.\n\nWait, let me double-check to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. So, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). That seems correct. Then, in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the constant term is when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, which occurs at \\(k = 3\\), so \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying 6 and 20 gives 120. That seems right. I don't think I missed anything here. So, yeah, the coefficient should be 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Multiplying these gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\boxed{120}."

    "text": " So, the coefficient from the first part is 6.\n\nNow, the expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I suppose that part doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms, so maybe I just need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and then consider the entire expansion as a product. But wait, actually, since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are different variables, the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from those involving \\(c\\). So, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the expansion of the first part will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of the second part. However, since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I think that term would be the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and the constant term (i.e., the term with \\(c^0\\)) in the second part. Because if I take \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part and multiply it by some term in the second part, unless that term is a constant, it will introduce a \\(c\\) term, which would make the overall term have \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some \\(k\\), but the problem is only asking for \\(a^2b^2\\), which implies \\(c^0\\). So, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), and then multiply it by the coefficient from the first part, which is 6.\n\nAlright, so let me find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Again, I can use the binomial theorem here. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying that, each term becomes \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m} = \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, we need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be 0. So, \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Let's solve for \\(m\\): \\(6 - 2m = 0\\) implies \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). So, the term where \\(m = 3\\) will have \\(c^0\\). The coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Let me calculate that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\).\n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part is 20. Therefore, the overall coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficients from the two parts, which is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Wait, is that correct? Let me double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nFirst, in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). That seems right. Then, in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), I correctly identified that the term with \\(c^0\\) occurs when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), so \\(m = 3\\). The coefficient there is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\), which is correct. Then, multiplying these together gives 6 * 20 = 120. So, that should be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression. I think that's the right approach because when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficients multiply for the corresponding terms. Since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are independent variables, the only way to get a term with \\(a^2b^2\\) is to take the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first polynomial and the constant term from the second polynomial. Any other term from the second polynomial would introduce a power of \\(c\\), which we don't want in the term \\(a^2b^2\\). So, I think 120 is the correct answer.\n\nWait, just to make sure, let me think about whether there's another way to approach this problem. Maybe by expanding both parts fully and looking for the term, but that seems more complicated. Alternatively, perhaps using generating functions or considering the exponents more carefully. But I think the approach I took is solid because it's using the binomial theorem correctly for both parts and considering the necessary conditions to get the desired term. So, I feel confident that 120 is the correct coefficient.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is found by multiplying the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) and the constant term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\n1. In \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n2. In \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n3.

Wait, but the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Does that mean I don't need to consider the other part involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\)? Hmm, let me think. Since the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is only from the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), and when I multiply it by the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the expansion of the first part will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of the second part. But the problem is asking specifically for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, does that mean I need to consider all possible terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any term from the second expansion? Or is it only the term \\(a^2b^2\\) itself, regardless of what it's multiplied by? Hmm, I think it's the latter. Because when you multiply two expressions, each term from the first is multiplied by each term from the second, but the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would only come from the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by the term that has \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion, because otherwise, the exponent on \\(c\\) wouldn't be zero, and the term would have \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\). Wait, but the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. Or maybe I'm misunderstanding. Let me read the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, I think it's just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, considering all possible terms. But since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), the only way \\(a^2b^2\\) can appear is by taking the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part and multiplying it by the constant term (i.e., the term with \\(c^0\\)) from the second part. Because if you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by, say, \\(c^k\\) or \\(c^{-k}\\), then the resulting term would have \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2c^{-k}\\), but the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would be the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. So, I think I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and then multiply it by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), and that will give me the overall coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression. So, now I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let's expand that using the binomial theorem as well. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, we need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, which means \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(6 = 2m\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Now, going back to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficients from each part, which is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake. So, the first part gives 6 for \\(a^2b^2\\), and the second part gives 20 for \\(c^0\\), so when you multiply these together, you get 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120. Hmm, that seems right. Let me check my steps again. First, I expanded \\((a + b)^4\\) and found the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) as 6. Then, I considered that this term would be multiplied by the constant term from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which I found to be 20. Multiplying 6 and 20 gives 120.

But wait, the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). That means I don't need to consider the terms involving \\(c\\) because \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\).

Wait, no, that's not right. Actually, the entire expression is a product of two expansions, so maybe I need to consider how the terms multiply together. But hold on, \\(a^2b^2\\) is part of the first expansion, and the second expansion is in terms of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), which are separate variables. So, when I multiply these two expansions together, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part will be multiplied by every term from the second expansion. But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I think that term is just \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but that doesn't make sense because the sum of coefficients would be when \\(c = 1\\).

So, perhaps I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) and then multiply it by 6.\n\nWait, let me think again. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Since the entire expression is a product of two polynomials, one in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the other in \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be present in the product as \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by every term from the second expansion. But each term in the second expansion is of the form \\(c^k\\) or \\(c^{-k}\\), so when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), it becomes \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2c^{-k}\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would mean that the term must not have any \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\) factors. Therefore, the only term that contributes to \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) factors is when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, i.e., the constant term in the second expansion. So, I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) and then multiply it by the coefficient from the first part, which is 6.\n\nSo, how do I find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\)? Again, using the binomial theorem: \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(1/c\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be zero, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\), which is \\(\\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the constant term from the second part, which is 20. So, 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but let me double-check to make sure I didn't make a mistake. So, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). In \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the constant term is when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), so \\(m = 3\\), and \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying 6 and 20 gives 120.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is only considering the term \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms, which would mean that we need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and then multiply it by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because \\(c^0\\) is the term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), so that when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), it would give a term that's just \\(a^2b^2\\). That makes more sense. So, let me check that approach. First, find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which we already found as 6. Then, find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because when we multiply these two, the \\(c^0\\) term will give us \\(a^2b^2 \\times c^0 = a^2b^2\\), which is the term we're interested in. So, let's find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). To do that, we can use the binomial theorem again. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We want the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so we set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the two coefficients we found: 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the second part). So, 6 times 20 is 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120. Wait, but let me double-check that. So, in the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. In the second part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. When we multiply these two expressions together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part gets multiplied by each term in the second part. But since we're only interested in the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, which is 20, then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is indeed 6 * 20 = 120. That seems correct. Alternatively, if I were to consider the entire expansion, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by every term in the second expression, but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, then actually, the coefficient would be 6 times the entire sum of the coefficients in the second expression. But earlier, I thought that the sum of the coefficients in the second expression is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. But that contradicts the previous result. So, I must be making a mistake here. Let me clarify: the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but it's in the product of two expressions. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by every term in the second expression, which includes various powers of \\(c\\). However, when we talk about the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), we're referring to the coefficient of the term \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). But that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the entire sum of the coefficients in the second expression, because each term in the second expression would multiply \\(a^2b^2\\), contributing to the overall coefficient. But wait, no, that's not quite right. Because in the product, each term is a product of a term from the first expression and a term from the second expression. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is only multiplied by the term \\(c^0\\) in the second expression to give a term that's just \\(a^2b^2\\). All other terms would have additional factors of \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), making them \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2c^{-k}\\), which are different terms. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is only the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expression and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expression. So, that would be 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the correct coefficient is 120. I think I was confused earlier when I considered the sum of all coefficients in the second expression, but that's not necessary because we're only interested in the term where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out, leaving us with just \\(a^2b^2\\). So, to summarize, the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplying it by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20. Therefore, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\boxed{120}"

Wait, but that's not correct because each term in the second expansion has its own coefficient, so when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each of those, the total coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in the second expansion. But the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) would be found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, would the coefficient be 6 * 64 = 384? That seems high. Wait, but let me think again.\n\nWait, no, because when you multiply two expressions, the coefficients add up when terms combine. But in this case, since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, so each term would be \\(a^2b^2\\) times something involving \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. Wait, that can't be right because \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term in the product, but it's being multiplied by different powers of \\(c\\), so each of those would be separate terms. So, perhaps the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is just 6, and that's it. Because \\(a^2b^2\\) is only being multiplied by the 1 from the second expansion, but that doesn't make sense because the second expansion has many terms. I'm getting confused here.\n\nWait, maybe I need to clarify the problem. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but it's part of the product of two expressions. So, in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, each term in the second expansion is of the form \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, when I multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each of these, I get terms like \\(a^2b^2 \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, each of these terms is a separate term in the product, but the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, but \\(a^2b^2\\) is being multiplied by different powers of \\(c\\), so each of these would be a different term, not just \\(a^2b^2\\) by itself. So, does that mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is actually the sum of all the coefficients from the second expansion? Because each term in the second expansion, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), contributes to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^{6 - 2k}\\). But the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. Wait, that doesn't make sense because \\(a^2b^2\\) is being multiplied by different \\(c\\) terms, so each would be a separate term. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, and that's it. Because the second part is being multiplied, but since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is independent of the \\(c\\) terms. So, the coefficient is 6.\n\nWait, but that seems too simple, and I might be missing something. Let me try another approach. Let me consider the entire expansion. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When I expand this, each term will be of the form \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k \\times \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying the \\(c\\) terms, it becomes \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}\\dbinom{6}{m} a^{4 - k}b^k c^{6 - 2m}\\). Now, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, I need to find all terms where \\(a^{4 - k}b^k = a^2b^2\\), which implies \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). So, \\(k = 2\\), and the coefficient from the first part is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Now, for each such term, the coefficient from the second part is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\), but since we're only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, does that mean we have to sum all the coefficients from the second expansion? Because each term with \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by a different power of \\(c\\), but the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not considering the \\(c\\) terms. Wait, but in reality, each term would be \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by a coefficient and a power of \\(c\\), so each of those would be a separate term. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. But the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion is when \\(c = 1\\), so it's \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient would be 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but that seems high. Alternatively, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which would mean that it's just 6, because the \\(c\\) terms are separate. But that doesn't seem right because when you multiply, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually be 6 times the entire expansion of the second part. But that would mean that \\(a^2b^2\\) is being multiplied by all the terms in the second expansion, so the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. So, that would make the coefficient 384.\n\nWait, but let me check this again. If I have \\((a + b)^4\\) expanded as \\(a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\), and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) expanded as \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, when I multiply these two, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion would be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. So, the coefficient is 384.\n\nBut wait, is that correct? Because each term in the second expansion has a coefficient, and when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each of those, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times each coefficient, but that's not quite right. Wait, no, because each term in the second expansion is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\), so when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each of those, you get terms like \\(6 \\dbinom{6}{m} a^2b^2 c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the sum of \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\) for all \\(m\\), which is 6 * 2^6 = 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but that seems correct because the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion is 64, so 6 times that would be 384. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 384.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because I thought the coefficient would just be 6, but now I'm seeing that it's 384. Let me make sure. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but in the product, \\(a^2b^2\\) is being multiplied by each term in the second expansion, which includes different powers of \\(c\\). So, each of those would contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^{something}\\). But the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not considering the \\(c\\) terms. Wait, but that can't be right because \\(a^2b^2\\) is being multiplied by different \\(c\\) terms, so each of those would be a separate term. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think differently. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient from the first part times the entire second part, because when you multiply, each term in the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but I'm not entirely sure. Let me check with a simpler example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). So, expanding \\((a + b)^2\\) gives \\(a^2 + 2ab + b^2\\). Expanding \\((c + 1/c)^1\\) gives \\(c + 1/c\\). Now, multiplying these together, the term \\(a^2\\) would be multiplied by \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), giving \\(a^2c\\) and \\(a^2/c\\). Similarly, \\(2ab\\) would be multiplied by \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), giving \\(2abc\\) and \\(2ab/c\\), and \\(b^2\\) would be multiplied by \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), giving \\(b^2c\\) and \\(b^2/c\\). Now, if I were to look for the coefficient of \\(a^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, it would be 1 times the sum of coefficients in the second expansion, which is \\(1 + 1 = 2\\), so 1 * 2 = 2. Similarly, the coefficient of \\(ab\\) would be 2 * 2 = 4, and the coefficient of \\(b^2\\) would be 1 * 2 = 2. So, in this simpler case, the coefficient of a term in the first expansion is multiplied by the sum of coefficients in the second expansion. So, applying that to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nOkay, that makes sense now. So, the coefficient is 384.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{384}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem for both parts of the expression.\n\n1. **Expanding \\((a + b)^4\\)**:\n   Using the binomial theorem, we have:\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\), so the coefficient is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\n   \\]\n\n2. **Considering the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)**:\n   Each term in this expansion is of the form \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\).

Wait, but that can't be right because when you multiply two polynomials, each term from the first is multiplied by each term from the second. But since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term in the first polynomial, and the second polynomial is in terms of \\(c\\), maybe the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would just be the coefficient from the first part times the entire second polynomial.

Wait, but that doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would then be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. But that seems incorrect because the second expansion is in terms of \\(c\\), so when you multiply, \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, but \\(a^2b^2\\) itself is a term in the product. Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think differently. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, in the product, the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) come from the first part, and the terms involving \\(c\\) come from the second part. So, if we're looking for a term that is only \\(a^2b^2\\), without any \\(c\\) terms, that would mean that in the second part, the term must be a constant term, i.e., the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. Because if you have \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by a term with \\(c^k\\), then the entire term would have \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), which is not just \\(a^2b^2\\). So, to get a term that is exactly \\(a^2b^2\\), we need to multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part. So, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me calculate that. Using the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, so set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20.

That means the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), right? Wait, no, that's not quite right. Because when you multiply two polynomials, each term from the first polynomial is multiplied by each term from the second. But in this case, since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), the variables don't interfere. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually just be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, that doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a specific term, \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\). Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again. So, the expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). If I expand both separately, then when I multiply them together, each term from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term from the second. However, since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) don't appear in the second part, the only way to get a term with \\(a^2b^2\\) is to take the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part and multiply it by the entire second part. But wait, that would mean the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which would include terms with various powers of \\(c\\). But the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not considering \\(c\\). Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the question. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, perhaps they just want the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). That is, they're treating \\(c\\) as another variable, but since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate, the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that seems unlikely because the coefficient of a term in a product is usually considered with all variables, but here, maybe it's just considering the part with \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). Wait, no, I think I'm overcomplicating. Let me try to clarify: when you have a product of two expressions, say \\(P(a, b) \\times Q(c)\\), then the coefficient of a specific term in \\(P(a, b)\\), say \\(a^2b^2\\), would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(P(a, b)\\) multiplied by the entire expression \\(Q(c)\\). But if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without considering \\(c\\), that is, treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable, then perhaps the coefficient is just 6 times the entire \\(Q(c)\\). But that doesn't make much sense because coefficients are typically numerical factors. Alternatively, maybe the problem is considering only the part with \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the rest is separate. Hmm, perhaps I need to interpret the problem as finding the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, which would involve terms with various powers of \\(c\\). But since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but that seems too broad. Wait, no, that's not correct. Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term would have a different power of \\(c\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by each of those terms, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), etc. But the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would only come from the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), because only the constant term would multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) to give a term without any \\(c\\). Wait, but that might not be the case. Let me think carefully.\n\nWait, no, that's not right either. Because if you have \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by, say, \\(c^k\\), that would create a term \\(a^2b^2c^k\\). So, unless \\(k = 0\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by some power of \\(c\\). Therefore, the only term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) that would contribute to \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) is when \\(k = 0\\), i.e., the constant term. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Therefore, I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Let me compute that. Using the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(1/c\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). The constant term occurs when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which gives \\(m = 3\\). So, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Wait, that seems correct, but let me double-check. So, \\((a + b)^4\\) has \\(a^2b^2\\) with coefficient 6, and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) has a constant term of 20. When you multiply these two, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by 20, so the coefficient becomes 6 * 20 = 120. That makes sense. Alternatively, if I consider the entire product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but only the constant term would result in a term with just \\(a^2b^2\\). All other terms would have \\(c\\) raised to some power, so they wouldn't be pure \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient is indeed 120. I think that's the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is found using the binomial theorem, which gives us 6. The constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is also found using the binomial theorem and is 20. Multiplying these together gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\boxed{120}."

    "text": " So, that part is clear. Now, the expression also includes \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but the problem is asking about the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\). So, does that mean I can treat the two parts separately? I think so because the variables \\(a, b\\) and \\(c\\) are independent. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would just be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the coefficient from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) for any term, but since we're only interested in \\(a^2b^2\\), maybe the part involving \\(c\\) doesn't affect it? Wait, no, actually, the entire expression is the product of the two expansions. So, when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), you get a sum of terms where each term is a product of a term from the first expansion and a term from the second expansion. But since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, that can't be right because when you multiply two expressions, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\), then it would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't make sense because the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of what happens with \\(c\\). So, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When you expand this, each term will be of the form \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}a^{4 - k}b^k \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - m}\\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying that, it becomes \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}\\dbinom{6}{m} a^{4 - k}b^k c^{6 - 2m}\\). Now, since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), we need \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). So, that term is fixed with \\(k = 2\\). But what about \\(m\\)? Since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), the exponent of \\(c\\) doesn't affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that can't be right because that would make the coefficient depend on the sum of all coefficients in the second expression, which is not correct. Wait, no, actually, when you multiply two expressions, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't make sense because the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, perhaps the answer is simply the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that would mean the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. Wait, no, that's not correct because each term in the product is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But actually, the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), so that would be \\((1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 * 64 = 384. But wait, that seems too straightforward. Let me check again. Alternatively, maybe I'm supposed to consider that the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is independent of \\(c\\), so when you multiply by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384. But that feels a bit off because the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not considering any specific power of \\(c\\). So, perhaps the answer is indeed 384. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it, and the problem just wants the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which would be 6. But that seems too simple, so I think the correct approach is to consider that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 64, giving 384. Wait, but let me think again. When you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in one polynomial is multiplied by the entire second polynomial. So, in this case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and when you multiply by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which has terms involving \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Since the sum of coefficients is found by substituting \\(c = 1\\), which gives 2^6 = 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is found using the binomial coefficient \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). The entire expression also includes \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), we consider the sum of all coefficients in the second expression by setting \\(c = 1\\), yielding \\(2^6 = 64\\). Multiplying these results gives \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\(\\boxed{384}\\)."
