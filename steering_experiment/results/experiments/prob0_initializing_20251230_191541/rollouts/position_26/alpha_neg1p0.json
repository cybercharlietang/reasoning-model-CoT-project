In \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the constant term is when \\(m = 3\\), which gives 20. So, 6 * 20 is 120. That seems correct. I don't think I made a mistake here.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of the entire expression as the product of two independent expansions. Since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are different variables, the exponents don't interfere with each other. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is just the product of the coefficients from each part where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) match. So, yes, that's 6 from the first part and 20 from the second part, giving 120. I think that's right.\n\nSo, the final answer should be 120. Wait, but let me just make sure I didn't miss anything. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression. Since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are separate variables, when we multiply the two expansions, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will only come from the product of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and the \\(c^0\\) term in the second part. There are no other terms in the first expansion that would contribute to \\(a^2b^2\\) when multiplied by a term from the second expansion because any term from the second expansion would have a \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), which would add an exponent to \\(c\\), making it not a constant term. So, the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms is to multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term by the constant term from the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient is indeed 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nI think that's solid. So, I can confidently say the coefficient is 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem for both parts of the expression.\n\n1. **Expanding \\((a + b)^4\\):**\n   Using the binomial theorem, we have:\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\):\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\n   \\]\n   So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\n2. **Expanding \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   Using the binomial theorem, we have:\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n   \\]\n   We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0:\n   \\[\n   6 - 2m = 0 \\implies m = 3\n   \\]\n   The coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\n   \\]\n\n3. **Combining the coefficients:**\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficients from each part:\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 20 = 120\n   \\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

Alternatively, I can think about the entire expansion. When you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first expansion is multiplied by every term in the second expansion. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), we need to consider only the term in the second expansion that is \\(c^0\\), because any other term would introduce a \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\) factor, making the product have a term like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), which isn't what we're looking for. So, only the \\(c^0\\) term contributes to the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the product. Therefore, the coefficient is indeed 6 * 20 = 120. I think that's correct.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to consider the entire expression as a product of two independent binomial expansions. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first part, and the term \\(c^0\\) comes from the second part. Since these are independent, their coefficients multiply, giving the total coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. So, yes, 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, is there any chance I made a mistake in calculating the binomial coefficients? Let me check \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) again. 4! is 24, 2! is 2, so 24 / (2 * 2) = 6. That's correct. And \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\) is 20, because 6! is 720, 3! is 6, so 720 / (6 * 6) = 20. Yep, that's right. So, 6 * 20 is 120. I think that's solid.\n\nAlternatively, if I were to write out the entire expansion, it would be tedious, but let me consider a smaller example to see if the logic holds. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, expanding \\((a + b)^2\\) gives \\(a^2 + 2ab + b^2\\). Expanding \\((c + 1/c)^1\\) gives \\(c + 1/c\\). Now, multiplying these, the term \\(a^2\\) would be multiplied by \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), giving \\(a^2c\\) and \\(a^2/c\\). Similarly, the term \\(2ab\\) would give \\(2ab c\\) and \\(2ab / c\\), and \\(b^2\\) would give \\(b^2c\\) and \\(b^2/c\\). So, in this case, there is no constant term in \\(a^2b^2\\) because the second expansion only has degree 1 in \\(c\\), so the product can't have a term without \\(c\\). Wait, but in our original problem, the second expansion is to the 6th power, which allows for a constant term. So, in this smaller example, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be zero because there's no constant term. But in our problem, there is a constant term, so it's possible. So, that's consistent.\n\nWait, but in the smaller example, if I had \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^2\\), then the second expansion would have a constant term. Let's check that. \\((c + 1/c)^2 = c^2 + 2 + 1/c^2\\). So, the constant term is 2. Then, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{2}{1}\\) which is 2, because \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the middle term. Wait, no, \\((a + b)^2\\) is \\(a^2 + 2ab + b^2\\), so \\(a^2b^2\\) isn't a term here. Wait, so maybe that's a bad example. Let me try \\((a + b)^3\\). Then, \\((a + b)^3 = a^3 + 3a^2b + 3ab^2 + b^3\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b\\) is 3. Then, if I multiply by \\((c + 1/c)^2 = c^2 + 2 + 1/c^2\\), the constant term is 2. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b\\) in the product would be 3 * 2 = 6. That makes sense. So, in that case, the logic holds. So, in our original problem, the same approach works.\n\nSo, to recap: The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 20. Multiplying them gives 120, which is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression. I think that's correct.\n\nJust to make sure, let me think about the degrees. In \\((a + b)^4\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is of degree 4 in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). In \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term \\(c^0\\) is the constant term, which is degree 0 in \\(c\\). So, when we multiply these, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) remains as is, without any \\(c\\) terms, so it's just \\(a^2b^2\\) with coefficient 6 * 20 = 120. So, that's the term we're looking for. I don't think I missed anything here.\n\nI guess another way to see it is that the two parts of the expression are independent. So, the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) doesn't affect the \\(c\\) terms, and vice versa. So, when you're looking for a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), you only need to consider the part of the expansion that gives you a constant in \\(c\\), which is the \\(c^0\\) term. So, yeah, that makes sense.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me think about the entire product. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, when you multiply these out, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by every term in the second part, but only the term \\(c^0\\) from the second part will result in a term that's just \\(a^2b^2\\), without any \\(c\\) involved. All other terms from the second part will introduce a \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), so they won't contribute to the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. Therefore, the coefficient is indeed the product of the two coefficients: 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nI think that's thorough enough. I can't think of any mistakes in this reasoning. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem.\n\nFirst, consider the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n\\]\nThe term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\), so the coefficient is:\n\\[\n\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\n\\]\n\nNext, consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem:\n\\[\n\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n\\]\nWe need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, which occurs when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\).

So, we need to find the value of \\(m\\) such that the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0. That is, \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\): \\(6 - 2m = 0\\) \u21d2 \\(2m = 6\\) \u21d2 \\(m = 3\\). So, the term where \\(m = 3\\) is the one with \\(c^0\\). The coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Now, since the original expression is the product of \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be obtained by multiplying the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part by the \\(c^0\\) term from the second part. Therefore, the coefficient is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the second part). So, 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120.\n\nWait, let me just make sure I didn't make a mistake. So, \\((a + b)^4\\) gives \\(a^2b^2\\) with coefficient 6, and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) gives \\(c^0\\) with coefficient 20. Multiplying them gives 120. That seems correct. I don't think I missed anything because the \\(c\\) terms don't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms, so their coefficients just multiply together. Yeah, I think that's right.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is found by multiplying the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) (which is 6) by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) (which is 20). Thus, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\boxed{120}"

Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120.\n\nWait, let me double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake. First, expanding \\((a + b)^4\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed when \\(k = 2\\), giving \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). That seems right. Then, for \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), I used the binomial theorem and found that the term with \\(c^0\\) is when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), so \\(m = 3\\), and the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying 6 and 20 gives 120. Yeah, that seems correct. I don't think I made any mistakes here. So, I'm confident that the coefficient is 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem.\n\nFirst, consider the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n\\]\nWe need the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2.
