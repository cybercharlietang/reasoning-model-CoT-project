Let me work on the second part now. The expression is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Again, I can use the binomial theorem here. The expansion is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying that, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\times c^{-m} = \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the exponent of \\(c\\) in each term is \\(6 - 2m\\).

Let me work on the second part now. To find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), I can again use the binomial theorem. The expansion is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\).

So, 6 multiplied by 20 is 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120.\n\nWait a second, let me double-check that. So, I found that in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, and in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. So, when I multiply these two expressions together, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) gets multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part gets multiplied by the constant term (which is 20) from the second part, resulting in \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). That seems correct. But let me think again: is there a possibility that other terms could contribute to \\(a^2b^2\\) when multiplied by terms from the second expression? For example, if I have a term with \\(a^3b\\) in the first part, could it combine with a term in the second part to give \\(a^2b^2\\)? But wait, the second expression only has terms with \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), not with \\(a\\) or \\(b\\). So, when you multiply \\(a^3b\\) by any term from the second expression, you'll still have \\(a^3b\\) times some power of \\(c\\), which won't affect the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). So, the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) only come from the first expression, and the exponents of \\(c\\) come from the second. Therefore, the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is to take the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first expression and the \\(c^0\\) term from the second. So, my initial conclusion seems correct. Therefore, the coefficient is 120.\n\nWait another thing: maybe I should write out the entire product to make sure. Let me try that. The product is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Expanding \\((a + b)^4\\), we get terms like \\(a^4\\), \\(4a^3b\\), \\(6a^2b^2\\), \\(4ab^3\\), and \\(b^4\\). Expanding \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), we get terms like \\(c^6\\), \\(6c^5 \\times (1/c)\\), which is \\(6c^4\\), then \\(15c^3 \\times (1/c)^2 = 15c\\), \\(20c^2 \\times (1/c)^3 = 20 \\times c^{-1}\\), \\(15c \\times (1/c)^4 = 15 \\times c^{-3}\\), \\(6 \\times (1/c)^5 \\times c = 6 \\times c^{-4}\\), and finally \\( (1/c)^6 = c^{-6}\\). Wait, no, that's not quite right. Let me correct that. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\times (1/c)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the exponents are \\(6 - 2m\\). So, when \\(m=0\\), exponent is 6; \\(m=1\\), exponent is 4; \\(m=2\\), exponent is 2; \\(m=3\\), exponent is 0; \\(m=4\\), exponent is -2; \\(m=5\\), exponent is -4; \\(m=6\\), exponent is -6\\). So, the terms are:\n\n- \\(m=0\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{0} c^6 = 1 \\times c^6\\)\n- \\(m=1\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{1} c^4 = 6 c^4\\)\n- \\(m=2\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{2} c^2 = 15 c^2\\)\n- \\(m=3\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} c^0 = 20\\)\n- \\(m=4\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{4} c^{-2} = 15 c^{-2}\\)\n- \\(m=5\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{5} c^{-4} = 6 c^{-4}\\)\n- \\(m=6\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{6} c^{-6} = 1 c^{-6}\\)\n\nSo, when we multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion will multiply each term in the second expansion. So, for example, the \\(a^4\\) term in the first expansion will multiply each term in the second expansion, resulting in terms like \\(a^4 c^6\\), \\(6a^4 c^4\\), etc. Similarly, the \\(6a^2b^2\\) term in the first expansion will multiply each term in the second expansion, giving terms like \\(6a^2b^2 c^6\\), \\(36a^2b^2 c^4\\), etc., all the way down to \\(6a^2b^2 \\times 20\\), which is \\(120a^2b^2\\). So, in the product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will only appear when we take the \\(6a^2b^2\\) term from the first expansion and multiply it by the constant term (20) from the second expansion. All other terms from the second expansion will have a power of \\(c\\), so when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), they won't contribute to the \\(a^2b^2\\) term without any \\(c\\). Therefore, the only contribution to \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). So, that confirms my earlier conclusion. Therefore, the coefficient is indeed 120.\n\nWait, but just to be thorough, let me consider if there's any other way that \\(a^2b^2\\) could appear. Suppose I take a term from \\((a + b)^4\\) that has a higher power of \\(a\\) or \\(b\\) and then multiply it by a term from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) that has a negative exponent of \\(c\\). But that wouldn't affect the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), right? Because the \\(c\\) terms are separate variables. So, for example, if I take \\(a^3b\\) from \\((a + b)^4\\) and multiply it by \\(c^{-1}\\) from the second expansion, I get \\(a^3b c^{-1}\\), which isn't \\(a^2b^2\\). Similarly, taking \\(ab^3\\) and multiplying by \\(c^{-1}\\) gives \\(ab^3 c^{-1}\\), which also isn't \\(a^2b^2\\). So, no, there's no way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) without taking the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first expansion and the constant term from the second. Therefore, I can be confident that the coefficient is 120.\n\nJust to recap, the steps I took were:\n\n1. Recognize that I need the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product of two expansions.\n2. Use the binomial theorem to expand \\((a + b)^4\\) and find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is 6.\n3. Then, recognize that to get the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, it must be multiplied by a term from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) that doesn't affect the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), i.e., a constant term in \\(c\\).\n4. Use the binomial theorem again on \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\), which is 20.\n5. Multiply the two coefficients together to get the final coefficient: 6 * 20 = 120.\n6.

Wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake here. So, when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficients multiply when the variables match. But in this case, the variables are different; one is in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the other is in \\(c\\). So, when you take the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first polynomial and multiply it by the term \\(c^0\\) from the second polynomial, the variables don't interfere because one has \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the other has \\(c\\). So, the product would indeed be \\(6 \\times 20 a^2b^2 c^0\\), which is just \\(120 a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient is 120. Let me just check if there's any other term that could contribute to \\(a^2b^2\\). Since the second polynomial only contributes a constant term when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), there are no other terms in the second polynomial that would affect the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. So, I think 120 is the correct coefficient.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Next, we find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying these coefficients together gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\boxed{120}"

So, when we multiply the two parts, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by the constant term 20, so the total coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120. That seems correct. I don't think I made a mistake here. So, yeah, the coefficient should be 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem.\n\nFirst, consider the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\). Using the binomial theorem, we have:\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n\\]\nThe term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\), so the coefficient is:\n\\[\n\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\n\\]\n\nNext, consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem, we have:\n\\[\n\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n\\]\nWe need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, which occurs when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(m = 3\\). The coefficient is:\n\\[\n\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\n\\]\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficients from each part:\n\\[\n6 \\times 20 = 120\n\\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}."

Let me work on the second part. So, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) can be expanded using the binomial theorem as well. The general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k\\). Simplifying that, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} c^{-k} = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We want the exponent of \\(c\\) to be 0, so we set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Let me compute that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Now, since the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is multiplied by the entire second part, but we're only interested in the term where the \\(c\\) exponent is 0, which has a coefficient of 20, the total coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 * 20. Let me compute that: 6 * 20 = 120. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120. Wait, let me just double-check my reasoning. I considered that the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from multiplying the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial by the constant term in the second polynomial. That makes sense because any other term would introduce a \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), which would change the term we're looking for. So, yes, I think that's correct. Therefore, the coefficient is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is found by considering the relevant terms in each binomial expansion. From \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient is 6. From \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the constant term's coefficient is 20. Multiplying these gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\boxed{120}"
