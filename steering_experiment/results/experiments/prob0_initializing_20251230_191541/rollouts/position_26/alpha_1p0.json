Let me work on the second part now. The expression is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I can expand this using the binomial theorem as well. The binomial expansion would be \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\).

For example, could there be other terms in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) that, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), result in a term without \\(c\\)? Well, if you take any term other than the constant term from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), it would have a power of \\(c\\) either positive or negative. So, when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by, say, \\(c^k\\), you'd get \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), which would be a different term. So, the only way to get a term that's just \\(a^2b^2\\) (without any \\(c\\) terms) is to multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by the constant term \\(c^0\\). Therefore, my initial reasoning holds.

Let me write that out. \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying each term, that becomes \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m} = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, each term has an exponent of \\(c\\) equal to \\(6 - 2m\\). I need to find the term where the exponent is 0, because that's the constant term. So, set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), I get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Now, since the two parts are multiplied together, the total coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Let me just make sure I didn't make a mistake here. So, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6. In \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term where the exponent is 0 is when \\(m = 3\\), so the coefficient is 20. Multiplying these together gives 120. I think that's correct. Wait, let me double-check the exponents in the second expansion. Each term is \\(c^{6 - m} \\times (1/c)^m = c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, setting \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), \\(m = 3\\), so the term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} c^0 = 20\\). Yep, that's right. So, the coefficient is 120. So, the final answer should be 120.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me think again. The problem is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, when you multiply these two, each term in the first expansion gets multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is multiplied by every term in the second expansion. But since we only want the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), we need to find the term in the second expansion that is \\(c^0\\), because any other term would introduce a \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), making the product have \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), which isn't what we want. So, only the constant term in the second expansion will contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, that's why we multiply 6 by 20 to get 120. I think that makes sense. So, I'm confident that the coefficient is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Multiplying these together gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\boxed{120}"

Let me figure that out. So, again, using the binomial theorem, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying that, it becomes \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m} = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\).

Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient from the second part is 20. Now, since we're multiplying the two expansions together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part will multiply the constant term in the second part. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 multiplied by 20. Let me compute that: 6 * 20 = 120. So, the coefficient should be 120. Wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake. So, the first part: \\((a + b)^4\\) gives 6 for \\(a^2b^2\\). The second part: \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) gives 20 for the constant term. So, when you multiply, the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120. That seems right. Alternatively, maybe I can think of it as the entire product being \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), and when you expand it, each term from the first polynomial is multiplied by each term from the second. So, to get \\(a^2b^2\\), you need to pick the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first polynomial and the constant term from the second polynomial. So, yes, that's 6 * 20 = 120. I think that's correct.

So, when expanding this, each term from \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\).

Wait, no, that's not right. Because when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each polynomial. But in this case, since the term \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), it's only affected by the term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) that has \\(c^0\\), which is the constant term. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is indeed the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\).

Let me work on that next. To find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), I can again use the binomial theorem. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\).

Then, I can multiply these two coefficients together to get the final coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression.

Let me tackle the second part now. The expression is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Again, I can use the binomial theorem for this. The binomial expansion is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying each term, that becomes \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m} = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, each term has an exponent of \\(c\\) equal to \\(6 - 2m\\). I need the term where the exponent is 0, because that's the constant term. So, set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), I get \\(2m = 6\\) which means \\(m = 3\\). So, the term where \\(m = 3\\) is the constant term. The coefficient for that term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Let me compute that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\).

Now, going back to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the two coefficients I found. So, that would be 6 (from the \\(a^2b^2\\) term) multiplied by 20 (from the constant term in the \\(c\\) expansion). So, 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 120.\n\nWait, let me double-check my reasoning. I considered that the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from multiplying the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first polynomial by the constant term in the second polynomial. That makes sense because any other term in the second polynomial would introduce a \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\) term, which would make the product have a \\(c\\) component, which we don't want since we're only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, yes, I think that's correct. Also, checking the calculations: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\) and \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\), and 6 * 20 is indeed 120.
