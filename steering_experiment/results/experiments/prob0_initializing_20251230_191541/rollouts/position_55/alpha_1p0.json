So, as I did before, I just need the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part, and multiply them together. So, 6 * 20 = 120.

    "text": " Hmm, seems right. I think that's the correct answer.\n\nWait, but let me think again: when we have the product of two polynomials, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first polynomial, and to get a term without \\(c\\), we need to multiply it by the constant term from the second polynomial, which is 20. So, yes, 6 * 20 = 120. That makes sense. I don't think I missed anything here.\n\nAnother way to think about it: the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), the exponents don't interfere. So, the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) is to take the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part and multiply it by the constant term from the second part, which is 20.
