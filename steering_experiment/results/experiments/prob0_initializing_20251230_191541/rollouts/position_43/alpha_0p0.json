Another way to think about it is, the entire expression is the product of two expansions. So, when you multiply them, each term from the first expansion multiplies each term from the second. But since we're looking for a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), it has to come from the term in the first expansion that's \\(a^2b^2\\) and the term in the second expansion that's \\(c^0\\).

But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, but wait, no, actually, no. Wait, no, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by the entire \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) expansion. So, in the product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, leading to terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), etc., each with their own coefficients. But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not considering the \\(c\\) terms. Wait, that's a bit confusing. Wait, no, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, which includes all variables. So, actually, \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), so it's only present if there's a term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) that is \\(c^0\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) from the other expansion. So, yes, that's 6 * 20 = 120. So, I think that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of it as the product of two independent expansions. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part is 20, so when you multiply the two expressions, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is 6 * 20 = 120. But the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, but in reality, \\(a^2b^2\\) is only multiplied by \\(c^0\\), so the term is \\(120a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient is 120. So, yeah, I think that's the correct answer.\n\nWait, but let me check if I made a mistake in calculating the binomial coefficients. For \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\), that's 6, which is correct. For \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\), that's 20, which is also correct. So, 6 * 20 is indeed 120.
