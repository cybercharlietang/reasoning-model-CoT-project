    "text": " So, when we multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But since we only want the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, we only take the 20 from the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 * 20 = 120. That makes sense. Wait, but let me make sure I'm not missing anything. Let me think about how the multiplication works. When you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second. So, in this case, \\((a + b)^4\\) is a polynomial in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is a polynomial in \\(c\\). So, when you multiply them, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, for the term \\(a^2b^2\\), it's only multiplied by the constant term (the term with \\(c^0\\)) in the second polynomial, because any other term would introduce a \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\) factor, which would make the product have a term with \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), but the original problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. Wait, actually, no. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but in the entire product, which includes all possible combinations of \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) terms. Wait, hold on, maybe I'm misinterpreting the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\).\" So, does that mean we're looking for the coefficient of the term that has exactly \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\)? Or are we supposed to find the coefficient when considering all terms, including those with \\(c\\)? Hmm, that's a bit ambiguous. Wait, but in the original problem, it's written as \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", which in algebra usually refers to the coefficient when considering all variables. But in this case, the expression is a product of two polynomials, one in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the other in \\(c\\). So, when you multiply them, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second, resulting in terms like \\(a^kb^{4 - k}c^m\\) or \\(a^kb^{4 - k}c^{-m}\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would only appear when multiplied by the constant term in the second polynomial. Because if you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by a term with \\(c^m\\) or \\(c^{-m}\\), you'd get \\(a^2b^2c^m\\) or \\(a^2b^2c^{-m}\\), which are different terms. Therefore, the only term in the product that has exactly \\(a^2b^2\\) (without any \\(c\\) terms) is \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by the constant term from the second polynomial. So, that means the coefficient is indeed 6 * 20 = 120. Alternatively, if the problem had been asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), that would also be 120, but since it's just \\(a^2b^2\\), I think that's what they're asking for. So, I think my initial approach was correct. Therefore, the coefficient is 120. I can also think of it another way: the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Since the variables \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are independent, the coefficients for terms involving different variables multiply together. So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6, and the coefficient for \\(c^0\\) in the second part is 20, so the combined coefficient for \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is 6*20=120.
