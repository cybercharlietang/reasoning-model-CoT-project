Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is 120.\n\nWait, but just to be thorough, let me make sure I didn't miss anything. So, when we multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, for the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), it will be multiplied by every term in the second expansion. But since we're only interested in the terms where the product doesn't involve \\(c\\) (i.e., \\(c^0\\)), we only take the term from the second expansion that has \\(c^0\\). So, yes, that term is 20, so multiplying by 6 gives 120. Alternatively, if I think about it, the entire expression is a product of two polynomials, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the sum over all possible products of coefficients from each polynomial that result in \\(a^2b^2\\). But since the second polynomial doesn't have \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) is to take the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first polynomial and the constant term from the second polynomial. So, that's why we just multiply the two coefficients together. So, I think my reasoning is correct. Therefore, the coefficient is 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem.\n\nFirst, consider the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n\\]\nWe need the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which corresponds to \\(k = 2\\):\n\\[\n\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\n\\]\n\nNext, consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem:\n\\[\n\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n\\]\nWe need the coefficient of \\(c^0\\), which corresponds to \\(6 - 2m = 0\\).

Therefore, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by the constant term from the second part, which is 20. So, 6 times 20 is indeed 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120. Hmm, wait, let me think again. Is there a possibility that I'm missing something? For example, could there be other terms in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) that when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\) would still result in a term with \\(a^2b^2\\)? But no, because any term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) that isn't \\(c^0\\) would have a \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\) term, which would make the entire product have a \\(c\\) term, but the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term without any \\(c\\). So, only the constant term from the second polynomial would contribute to the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the product. Therefore, I think I'm correct. The coefficient is 120. Wait, just to make sure, let me try expanding both parts a bit more. For \\((a + b)^4\\), the expansion is \\(a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). So, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term is indeed 6a^2b^2. Now, for \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the expansion is \\(c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15/c^2 + 6/c^4 + 1/c^6\\). So, the constant term is 20, as I found earlier. Therefore, when I multiply these two expansions together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion will multiply each term in the second expansion. But only the 20 term will multiply it without introducing any \\(c\\) terms. So, the product term is \\(6a^2b^2 \\times 20 = 120a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient is indeed 120.

Let me make sure I'm not missing anything here. The problem is \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, when we expand both, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second. But since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), we only consider the terms where the \\(c\\) exponents cancel out, i.e., \\(c^0\\). So, yes, that makes sense. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from taking \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part and \\(c^0\\) from the second part, and multiplying them together. So, the coefficient is indeed 6*20=120. I think that's correct. Let me try another way to see if I get the same result. Alternatively, I can consider the entire expression as \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Since these are two separate variables, the coefficients for each term in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are independent of the coefficients in \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is exactly what I did earlier. So, that's consistent. Therefore, I'm confident that the coefficient is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is found by multiplying the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\n1.
