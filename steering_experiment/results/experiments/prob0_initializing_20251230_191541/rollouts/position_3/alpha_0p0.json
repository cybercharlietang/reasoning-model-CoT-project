    "text": " So, maybe I can apply that here.\n\nLet me start by expanding \\((a + b)^4\\). Using the binomial theorem, this would be \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\\). I need the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2, so that would be when \\(4 - k = 2\\), which means \\(k = 2\\). So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in this expansion is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\\). So, the coefficient is 6. That part seems straightforward.\n\nNow, the other part of the expression is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I'm not sure how this interacts with the first part. Since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), maybe I don't need to worry about the \\(c\\) terms? Wait, no, because the entire expression is multiplied together, so I might need to consider the expansion of both parts and then see how they combine.\n\nBut wait, the question is only about the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So perhaps I can treat the two parts separately and then multiply their coefficients? Let me think. If I have \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), when I multiply them together, each term from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term from the second expansion. However, since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), maybe I can ignore the \\(c\\) terms? Or perhaps, since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient would just be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the constant term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). That seems plausible.\n\nSo, let me check that idea. If I take the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part, which has a coefficient of 6, and multiply it by the constant term from the second part, then the result would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression. So, I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nTo find the constant term, I can again use the binomial theorem. Expanding \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) gives \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying each term, that becomes \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m} = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\).\n\nThe constant term occurs when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. So, set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20.\n\nNow, going back to the original expression, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the product of the coefficient from the first part and the constant term from the second part. So, that would be \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120.\n\nWait a second, let me make sure I didn't miss anything. The problem is \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), and we're looking for \\(a^2b^2\\). So, when we expand both parts, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part is multiplied by every term from the second part. But since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the only way it can contribute to the coefficient is if it's multiplied by the constant term in the second part, which is 20. So, yes, that makes sense. So, 6 times 20 is indeed 120. I think that's correct.\n\nI don't think I made any mistakes in the calculations. Let me just recap:\n\n1. Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n\n2. Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem. The constant term is when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, which happens at \\(m = 3\\). The coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n\n3. Multiply the two coefficients together: \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nSo, yes, the coefficient should be 120. I don't see any errors in this reasoning.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem for both parts of the expression.\n\n1. **Expanding \\((a + b)^4\\):**\n   Using the binomial theorem, we have:\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term with \\(a^2b^2\\) occurs when \\(k = 2\\).

    "text": " So, maybe I can apply that here.\n\nAlright, let me start by expanding \\((a + b)^4\\). Using the binomial theorem, each term in the expansion will be of the form \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}a^{4 - k}b^k\\) where \\(k\\) goes from 0 to 4. I need the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so I should find the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2. That would mean \\(4 - k = 2\\) for \\(a\\), so solving that gives \\(k = 2\\). So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\).\n\nWait, let me calculate that. \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) is \\(\\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. Got that part.\n\nNow, the original expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I need to consider the entire product. But wait, the problem only asks for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). That means I don't need to worry about the \\(c\\) terms when looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), right? Because \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), so the coefficient will just be the product of the coefficients from each part.\n\nWait, is that correct? Let me think. So, when you multiply two expressions together, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression. So, if I have a term \\(a^2b^2\\) from \\((a + b)^4\\), and I multiply it by any term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the resulting term will have \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by some \\(c\\) term. But since the question is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) part, that means we're looking for all possible ways that \\(a^2b^2\\) can appear when multiplied by any term from the second expression. But wait, no, that's not quite right. Because \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term in the first part, and when multiplied by any term in the second part, it will result in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2c^{-k}\\), but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, we need to consider how many times \\(a^2b^2\\) appears when multiplied by any term in the second expression.\n\nWait, but actually, in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term is of the form \\(a^kb^{4 - k}c^m\\) or \\(a^kb^{4 - k}c^{-m}\\), where \\(k\\) ranges from 0 to 4 and \\(m\\) ranges from 0 to 6. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) (since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\)), we need to find all the terms in the product where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out, i.e., where \\(m = 0\\). So, that would mean we're looking for the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), and then multiply that by the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) from \\((a + b)^4\\).\n\nWait, that makes sense. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nSo, let me first compute the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem again, each term in the expansion is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - m}\\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\). We want the exponent of \\(c\\) to be 0, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\).\n\nTherefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, 6! is 720, but 3! is 6, so 720 divided by (6 * 6) is 720 / 36, which is indeed 20. So, the constant term is 20.\n\nNow, earlier, we found that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. So, the total coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but hold on. Let me make sure I didn't make a mistake. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, and the constant term in the second part is 20, so when you multiply them, you get 120. That seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should think about it differently. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, when expanding, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the sum of all coefficients in the second part, but only considering the terms where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out, i.e., the constant term. So, yes, that's consistent with what I did earlier.\n\nWait, another way to think about it: the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) where the exponents of \\(c\\) are zero, which is just the constant term, which we found to be 20. So, 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but let me check if there's another approach. Maybe I can consider that the entire expression is a product of two independent binomial expansions, so the coefficients multiply when you're looking for specific terms. So, yes, that's the case here.\n\nWait, another check: Let me compute \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) and see what the constant term is. The expansion is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - m}(1/c)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\). As before, the constant term is when 6 - 2m = 0, so m=3, which gives \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, that's correct.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me consider if there's any possibility that I'm missing something. For example, could there be terms where \\(c\\) cancels out in a way that affects the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)? But no, because \\(a^2b^2\\) is independent of \\(c\\), so any term in the second expansion that has a non-zero power of \\(c\\) would result in a term like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2c^{-k}\\), but since we're only interested in \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\), we only consider the constant term in the second expansion, which is 20. So, that's correct.\n\nTherefore, the final coefficient is 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem.\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\):\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\n   \\]\n   So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\n2. **Find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n   \\]\n   The constant term occurs when the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0:\n   \\[\n   6 - 2m = 0 \\implies m = 3\n   \\]\n   The constant term is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\n   \\]\n\n3. **Multiply the coefficients:**\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) and the constant term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 20 = 120\n   \\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

    "text": " So, for \\((a + b)^4\\), the expansion would involve terms from \\(a^4\\) down to \\(b^4\\), each multiplied by a binomial coefficient.\n\nSince I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), that should correspond to the term where \\(a\\) is squared and \\(b\\) is squared. In the binomial expansion, the exponent on \\(a\\) is \\(4 - k\\) and the exponent on \\(b\\) is \\(k\\), right? So, if I set \\(4 - k = 2\\), then \\(k = 2\\). So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), should be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Let me calculate that: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\\). So, that part is straightforward; the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\nNow, the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I'm a bit confused here because the term I'm looking for is \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\). So, does that mean that the coefficient from the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), just needs to contribute a constant term? Because if I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and that term doesn't have any \\(c\\) in it, then the other part must be the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, i.e., \\(c^0 = 1\\). That way, when I multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by 1, it remains \\(a^2b^2\\).\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm thinking correctly. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product. So, the entire product is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When I expand this, I will have terms like \\(a^kb^{4 - k} \\times c^m \\times \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^n\\), where \\(m + n = 6\\), right? Because each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is of the form \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}c^m \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^{6 - m}\\), which simplifies to \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}c^{2m - 6}\\).\n\nWait, so each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}c^{2m - 6}\\), where \\(m\\) goes from 0 to 6. So, for the term to be a constant (i.e., \\(c^0\\)), we set \\(2m - 6 = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\).\n\nCalculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20. Therefore, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is multiplied by 20 from the second part, which gives me \\(20 \\times 6 = 120\\) as the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression.\n\nWait, but let me double-check that. So, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, and in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the coefficient for \\(c^0\\) is 20. Therefore, when I multiply these two parts together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by 20, so the total coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120. That seems right.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of it as the product of two independent expansions. Since the two parts are multiplied together, each term from the first expansion is multiplied by each term from the second expansion. But since I'm only interested in the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2 each, and the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, I don't need to consider any other terms. So, the coefficient is indeed 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make any calculation mistakes. Let's recalculate the binomial coefficients. For \\((a + b)^4\\), \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) is 6, correct. For \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term where the exponent is zero is when \\(m = 3\\), so \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\) is 20. So, 6 * 20 is 120. That seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can approach this problem by considering the entire expansion. Let me write out the expansions more formally.\n\nFirst, \\((a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\\). So, the term where \\(k = 2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} a^{2}b^{2} = 6a^2b^2\\).\n\nNext, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^{6 - m} = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{2m - 6}\\).\n\nNow, when I multiply these two expansions together, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. However, we only want the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero because that's the only term that won't introduce any \\(c\\) into the product, allowing \\(a^2b^2\\) to remain as is.\n\nAs we found earlier, the term where \\(2m - 6 = 0\\) is when \\(m = 3\\), and the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion gets multiplied by 20 from the second expansion, resulting in a coefficient of \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nWait a second, but just to make sure, maybe I should think about it differently. Let me consider the entire product and see if there's another way to approach it. Alternatively, perhaps using generating functions or considering the variables separately.\n\nBut I think the approach I took is solid. The key is recognizing that since the term \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the only way it can appear in the product is if it's multiplied by the constant term (with respect to \\(c\\)) from the second expansion. That way, the \\(c\\) terms cancel out, leaving just the constant, which allows \\(a^2b^2\\) to stand alone without any \\(c\\) factors.\n\nSo, to recap: the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Multiplying these together gives the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression as 120.\n\nI don't think I made any mistakes here. The logic seems sound. Both binomial coefficients were calculated correctly, and the reasoning about the exponents in the second expansion aligns with the requirement for the term to be constant. So, I'm confident that the coefficient is 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem.\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\), so the coefficient is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\n   \\]\n\n2. **Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^{6 - m} = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{2m - 6}\n   \\]\n   We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, which occurs when \\(2m - 6 = 0\\).

Since the two parts are multiplied together, the variables \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, when looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I can treat the two parts separately because \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are different variables.\n\nWait, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But actually, since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), perhaps we can consider that part separately. Let me clarify.\n\nWhen you have two expressions multiplied together, the terms from each are combined. But since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are different variables, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will come from the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by every term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, that would mean the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't sound right because each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) has different powers of \\(c\\), so when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), each would contribute a different term, but the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be the same as the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of the coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nWait, no, that's not correct. Because when you multiply two expressions, each term in the first expression is multiplied by each term in the second. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), the coefficient would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) has a coefficient, and when you multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), each of those coefficients would contribute to the overall coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product.\n\nWait, but that doesn't make sense because the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, actually, the coefficient would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each of those will contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times the respective power of \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not considering \\(c\\). So, perhaps I need to clarify: does the problem want the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), or does it want the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times some specific power of \\(c\\)? The problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", so I think it's regardless of \\(c\\). So, that would mean that the coefficient is the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nWait, but that seems a bit off. Let me think again. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, considering all variables. But since \\(c\\) is separate, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would have a coefficient that's multiplied by all the terms from the other part. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that can't be, because the coefficient would then be a polynomial in \\(c\\), not a single number.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me read the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), treating \\(c\\) as another variable. So, in the product, each term will be of the form \\(a^k b^m c^n\\) or \\(a^k b^m c^{-n}\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by every possible term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which are \\(c^6, 6c^4, 15c^2, 20, 15c^{-2}, 6c^{-4}, c^{-6}\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be \\(6 \\times (1 + 6 + 15 + 20 + 15 + 6 + 1)\\), because each of these coefficients from the \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) expansion would be multiplied by 6.\n\nWait, no, that's not correct. Because in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the sum of all coefficients is found by setting \\(c = 1\\). So, \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of all coefficients is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 times 64, which is 384. But wait, that seems high. Let me check that again.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just 6, and the rest of the expression is separate. But that doesn't make sense because when you multiply two expressions, each term in one is multiplied by each term in the other. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second part, which has coefficients. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second part.\n\nBut wait, the sum of all coefficients in the second part is when \\(c = 1\\), so \\(\\left(1 + 1/1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nBut let me think again. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would indeed be 6 times the sum of all coefficients from the second part, which is 64, so 6*64=384.\n\nBut wait, let me consider another approach. Maybe I'm supposed to treat \\(c\\) as a separate variable and find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, which would involve considering the coefficients from both parts. But I'm not sure if that's the case. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, meaning that the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of the second part. But that would make the coefficient a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a single coefficient.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, it's asking for the coefficient of the term \\(a^2b^2\\), which would be a term like \\(a^2b^2 \\times\\) [some expression involving \\(c\\)]. So, the coefficient would be an expression involving \\(c\\), not just a number. But the problem says \"the coefficient\", implying a numerical coefficient. So, perhaps I'm supposed to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), meaning that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients from the second part, which is 64, so 384.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), i.e., the term where the power of \\(c\\) is zero. That would make sense because then the coefficient would be a number. So, perhaps I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product.\n\nWait, the problem doesn't specify anything about \\(c\\), so maybe it's just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). But in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which would make it a polynomial in \\(c\\), but the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, so I think the intended interpretation is that it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\).\n\nSo, let's approach it that way. To find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). That makes more sense because then the coefficient would be a number.\n\nSo, first, find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6. Then, find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Then, multiply those two coefficients together to get the final coefficient.\n\nOkay, so let's find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem again, the expansion is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(1/c\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(k = 3\\). So, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 20. Now, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. So, multiplying these together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it might be 384, but that was when considering all coefficients. But if we're only considering the term where \\(c^0\\), then it's 20, so 6*20=120.\n\nBut let me make sure. The problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", not specifying anything about \\(c\\). So, if it's just \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\), then the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which is 64, so 6*64=384. But if it's \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it's 6*20=120.\n\nI think the problem is more likely asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), because otherwise, the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make much sense in this context. So, I think the correct approach is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nLet me double-check that. So, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). In \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying them together, 6*20=120. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is 120. Therefore, the answer should be 120.\n\nWait, but let me think again. If the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, regardless of \\(c\\), then it's 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which is 64, so 6*64=384. But I think that's not what the problem is asking. It's more likely that it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable, so the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which would make the coefficient a polynomial. But the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, so I think the intended answer is 120.\n\nWait, let me check with an example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^2\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{2}{2} = 1\\), times the sum of coefficients from \\((c + 1/c)^1\\), which is \\((1 + 1) = 2\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 1*2=2. But if I look at the product \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)\\), the expansion would include terms like \\(a^2b^2c\\) and \\(a^2b^2 \\times 1/c\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 2, which is the sum of coefficients from the second part.\n\nBut in that case, the coefficient is a number, but it's multiplied by \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), then it's 2, but if it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it's 0, because there's no \\(c^0\\) term in \\((c + 1/c)^1\\). Wait, that's not right because \\((c + 1/c)^1\\) has terms \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), so the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 0. So, in that case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) would be 1*0=0.\n\nBut in the original problem, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) does have a \\(c^0\\) term, which is 20. So, in that case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is 120, as I calculated earlier.\n\nSo, I think the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. Therefore, the final answer is 120.\n\nWait, but let me make sure. Let me look up similar problems to see how they interpret such questions. Typically, when a problem asks for the coefficient of a term in a product of expressions, it's referring to the term where the variables match exactly, including any other variables. So, in this case, since the term \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the problem is likely asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem had asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), it would have said something like \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating \\(c\\) as a variable,\" but it didn't specify that. So, I think the intended interpretation is that it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nTherefore, after carefully considering both interpretations and checking with a simpler example, I believe the correct answer is 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break down the problem into two parts using the binomial theorem.\n\n1. **Finding the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\):**\n   Using the binomial theorem, the general term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is given by:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   We need the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2. This occurs when \\(k = 2\\):\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\n   \\]\n   Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\n2. **Finding the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   Using the binomial theorem, the general term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is given by:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n   \\]\n   We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0. This occurs when \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\):\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{6}{3} c^0 = 20\n   \\]\n   Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20.\n\n3. **Combining the coefficients:**\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is the product of the coefficients found in the two parts:\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 20 = 120\n   \\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

    "text": " So, maybe I can apply that here.\n\nLet me start by focusing on the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\). I need to find the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) appears. So, in the expansion, each term is \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\\). I want the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) to both be 2, so that means \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). Let me check: if \\(k = 2\\), then the term is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} a^{2}b^{2}\\). The binomial coefficient \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) is 6, so the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in this part is 6.\n\nNow, the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I need to consider how this part affects the coefficient. Wait, but I'm only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\). That means, in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by every term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since I just need the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, I think I just need to multiply the coefficient from the first part by the entire expansion of the second part, because each term in the second expansion will be multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\).\n\nWait, no, that might not be right. Let me think again. Actually, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\), and when you multiply it by the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the product will be a combination of a term from the first expansion and a term from the second. But since I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and not any specific term involving \\(c\\), I think I need to consider that \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by the entire sum of the second expansion. But wait, no, because the second expansion is a polynomial in \\(c\\), so each term in the product will have both \\(a^2b^2\\) and some power of \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating this.\n\nWait, actually, when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficients multiply term by term. So, in this case, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part. But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, which includes all possible terms, but we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, in other words, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire sum of the coefficients in the second part. Because each term in the second expansion contributes a factor that, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), gives a term with \\(a^2b^2\\) and some power of \\(c\\). But since the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) part, I think that's correct.\n\nWait, but that might not be the case. Let me clarify: when you multiply two expressions, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each factor. So, if I have \\( (a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 \\), then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, each term contributes a coefficient, and all those contributions add up to the total coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product.\n\nWait, no, that's not quite right. Let me think again. Actually, in the product, each term is a combination of a term from the first polynomial and a term from the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second part, which is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. But since the second part is a separate variable, \\(c\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be present in the product with all possible powers of \\(c\\), each multiplied by their respective coefficients. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is simply the coefficient from the first part times the entire expansion of the second part. But that doesn't make sense because the second part is a polynomial in \\(c\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually be the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part.\n\nWait, but that would be the case if we were considering the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which is what the problem is asking. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Let me approach it differently. Let's consider that the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first part, and when you multiply it by the second part, it's as if you're multiplying \\(a^2b^2\\) by the entire expansion of the second part. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the sum of all coefficients in the second part.\n\nWait, but the sum of all coefficients in the second part is obtained by setting \\(c = 1\\). Because when you substitute \\(c = 1\\), you get the sum of the coefficients. So, \\(\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = (2)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 64, which is 384.\n\nBut wait, let me verify that. Alternatively, maybe I should consider that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is only affected by the coefficient from the first part, because the second part doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\). So, actually, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by every term in the second expansion, but since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, the coefficient is just 6 times the entire expansion of the second part. But that seems a bit off because the expansion of the second part includes terms with different powers of \\(c\\), so how does that affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)?\n\nWait, no, in the product, each term is a combination of a term from the first polynomial and a term from the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part, which is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, each term in the product will be \\(a^2b^2 \\times c^k\\) for some \\(k\\), and each of these will have a coefficient. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, in other words, it's asking for the sum of all coefficients of terms that have \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by any power of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part.\n\nSince the sum of all coefficients in the second part is obtained by setting \\(c = 1\\), as I thought earlier, which gives \\(2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. Let me think about it differently. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). If I want the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I can treat the second part as a separate variable. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part, because each term in the second expansion will be multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, it's equivalent to multiplying the coefficient from the first part by the sum of all coefficients in the second part.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can think of it as the product of two independent expansions. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first expansion with coefficient 6, and the second expansion, when multiplied, will contribute all its terms, each with their own coefficients. So, the total coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64. So, 6 \u00d7 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because sometimes when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficients combine differently, but in this case, since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), I think it's correct to say that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just 6 times the sum of coefficients in the second part.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider that each term in the product is \\(a^2b^2 \\times\\) (some term in the second expansion). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire second expansion, which is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which means we're effectively treating the second expansion as a scalar multiple. Therefore, the coefficient is 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, giving 384.\n\nWait, but let me check this with a smaller example to make sure. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). The expansion of \\((a + b)^2\\) is \\(a^2 + 2ab + b^2\\). The expansion of \\((c + 1/c)^1\\) is \\(c + 1/c\\). So, the product is \\(a^2(c + 1/c) + 2ab(c + 1/c) + b^2(c + 1/c)\\). The coefficient of \\(a^2\\) is 1 times (c + 1/c), which would mean the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) in the product is \\(c + 1/c\\). But if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), it's not a number but a polynomial. So, perhaps my initial approach is incorrect.\n\nWait, so maybe I need to clarify: the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\). Therefore, in the product, \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\). But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), it's actually zero because \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^k\\), not by 1. Wait, that can't be right because the problem is asking for the coefficient, so perhaps it's considering all terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present, regardless of the \\(c\\) part. So, in that case, the coefficient would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire second expansion, which is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, not a scalar.\n\nBut the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which suggests that it's looking for a scalar. Therefore, perhaps I misunderstood the problem. Maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, considering all terms, but that would require more steps.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which includes all possible terms, but since \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by terms involving \\(c\\), the coefficient would actually be a polynomial in \\(c\\). However, the problem is phrased as asking for the coefficient, which is usually a scalar, so perhaps I'm misinterpreting the problem.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, but it's possible that the problem wants the coefficient regardless of \\(c\\), which would mean summing over all possible \\(c\\) terms. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting a numerical coefficient, treating \\(c\\) as a variable and considering the term \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) part, which would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But that seems unlikely because the problem is phrased as asking for the coefficient, not the coefficient times a polynomial.\n\nWait, perhaps I should re-express the problem. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\), and it's multiplied by each term from the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the entire expansion of the second part. So, the coefficient is 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would make the coefficient a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't seem right because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, considering all possible terms, which would require more detailed calculation. Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it, and the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and since the second part is multiplied by it, the total coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of the second part. But that seems incorrect because the coefficient should be a scalar.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\). But that's impossible because the product includes terms with \\(c\\). Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), i.e., the constant term in \\(c\\). That would make more sense. So, the problem might be asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), which would be the term where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out.\n\nIn that case, I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product. That would require finding the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), then multiplying them together.\n\nSo, let's break it down:\n\n1. Coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, as we found earlier.\n\n2. Coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\): To find this, we can use the binomial theorem again. The expansion is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be 0, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nWait, that makes more sense because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and if we consider the term without any \\(c\\) (i.e., \\(c^0\\)), then it's 120. So, perhaps I misread the problem initially, and it's actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nBut let me make sure. The original problem says: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" It doesn't specify any particular power of \\(c\\), so maybe it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. In that case, as I thought earlier, the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, giving 384.\n\nBut now I'm confused because depending on the interpretation, the answer could be either 120 or 384. To resolve this, let me check the problem statement again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" It doesn't specify any particular power of \\(c\\), so perhaps it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times any power of \\(c\\), which would mean summing over all possible coefficients of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for any \\(k\\). In that case, the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, giving 384.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), then it's 120. Since the problem doesn't specify, I think the more likely interpretation is that it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which would be 384.\n\nWait, but let me think again. When you have a product of two polynomials, the coefficient of a term in one polynomial is multiplied by all terms in the other polynomial. So, if you're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, it's the same as multiplying the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part by the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Therefore, 6 \u00d7 64 = 384.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So, the coefficient is 384.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought that if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), it's 120. So, which is it? The problem is a bit ambiguous. But given that it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without specifying \\(c\\), I think it's more likely that it's asking for the sum over all coefficients where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. Therefore, the answer is 384.\n\nWait, but let me confirm with another approach. Let's consider that the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). If I set \\(a = 1\\), \\(b = 1\\), \\(c = 1\\), then the value of the expression would be \\((1 + 1)^4 \\times (1 + 1)^6 = 16 \\times 64 = 1024\\). But the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would contribute \\(1^2 \\times 1^2 = 1\\), and its coefficient is multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part, which when \\(c = 1\\) is 64. So, the total contribution is 6 \u00d7 64 = 384, which is part of the total 1024. Therefore, this suggests that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 384.\n\nAlternatively, if I set \\(a = 1\\), \\(b = 1\\), \\(c = 1\\), the entire expression evaluates to 1024, which is the sum of all coefficients. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 \u00d7 64 = 384, which is part of this sum. Therefore, I think the correct answer is 384.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought that if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), it's 120. So, perhaps the problem is phrased ambiguously, but given the way it's written, I think the intended answer is 384.\n\nWait, but to make sure, let me consider the problem again. It says: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" It doesn't mention \\(c\\) at all, so perhaps it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which would mean summing over all possible coefficients from the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient is 6 \u00d7 64 = 384.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So, I think the answer is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplying it by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is \\(2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{384}"

    "text": " So, for \\((a + b)^4\\), the expansion would involve terms from \\(a^4\\) down to \\(b^4\\), each multiplied by a binomial coefficient.\n\nSince I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I can focus on the term where the power of \\(a\\) is 2 and the power of \\(b\\) is 2. Using the binomial theorem, the general term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\\). So, I need \\(4 - k = 2\\), which means \\(k = 2\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Let me compute that: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\nNow, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Since I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and the other part of the expression involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), which don't affect the powers of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), I think I can treat these parts separately. That is, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will just be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, no, actually, that's not quite right because when you multiply two expressions together, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second. However, since I'm only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and the second expression \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), the entire coefficient from the second expression will just be a scalar multiplier. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, that doesn't make sense because the coefficient is a number, not an expression. I think I'm getting confused here.\n\nLet me try to clarify. The problem asks for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but in the entire expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). However, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), so when you multiply by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which expands to terms involving various powers of \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that can't be right either because the problem is asking for a specific coefficient, not a sum. Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem.\n\nWait, no. Let me think again. The expression is a product of two binomials: \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When you expand the product, each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), that term in the first part is \\(6a^2b^2\\). When I multiply this by each term in the second expansion, I'll get terms like \\(6a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(6a^2b^2c^4\\), etc. However, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but in the entire expression, which includes all the \\(c\\) terms. But that doesn't make sense because \\(a^2b^2\\) is not multiplied by any \\(c\\) terms; rather, each term in the product will have both \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) parts and \\(c\\) parts. So, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). But that would mean summing over all possible coefficients where the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) parts are \\(a^2b^2\\), which would involve multiplying \\(6a^2b^2\\) by the sum of all terms in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). However, that would result in a term that is \\(6a^2b^2\\) times a constant, but that doesn't make sense because the coefficient would then be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me read the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, the expression is a product of two expansions. When you multiply them, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, which are terms like \\(c^6\\), \\(6c^4\\), \\(15c^2\\), \\(20\\), \\(15c^{-2}\\), \\(6c^{-4}\\), and \\(c^{-6}\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would actually be the sum of the coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by 6. So, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, the sum of the coefficients in a binomial expansion \\((x + y)^n\\) is obtained by setting \\(x = 1\\) and \\(y = 1\\), so \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but that seems too straightforward. Let me check that again. If I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = (1 + 1)^6 = 64\\), which is the sum of all the coefficients. Therefore, when I multiply \\(6a^2b^2\\) by 64, I get \\(384a^2b^2\\), so the coefficient is 384. That makes sense.\n\nBut wait, let me make sure I'm not missing something. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6a\u00b2b\u00b2. The second part, when expanded, is a polynomial in c, and when multiplied by 6a\u00b2b\u00b2, each term becomes 6a\u00b2b\u00b2 multiplied by each term in the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient of a\u00b2b\u00b2 in the entire product is indeed 6 multiplied by the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6*64=384.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should think of it as the coefficient of a\u00b2b\u00b2 in the product is the coefficient from the first part (which is 6) multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. But since the second part is a polynomial in c, the coefficient of a\u00b2b\u00b2 would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients of the second expansion, which is 6*64=384. So, that seems correct.\n\nWait, but another way to look at it is that when you have two polynomials multiplied together, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum of the products of the coefficients of terms whose variables multiply to give that specific term. But in this case, the variables are separate: the first part has a and b, the second part has c and 1/c. So, the variables don't interfere with each other. Therefore, the coefficient of a\u00b2b\u00b2 in the product is just the coefficient of a\u00b2b\u00b2 in the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part, because each term in the second part will multiply the a\u00b2b\u00b2 term, contributing their coefficients to the total coefficient of a\u00b2b\u00b2.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So, the sum of the coefficients in the second part is 64, so 6*64=384. Therefore, the coefficient of a\u00b2b\u00b2 is 384.\n\nWait, but let me confirm this with another approach. Let's compute the product step by step. The first part, (a + b)^4, has the term 6a\u00b2b\u00b2. The second part, (c + 1/c)^6, when expanded, is a sum of terms like \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - k}(1/c)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\\) for k from 0 to 6.\n\nNow, when we multiply 6a\u00b2b\u00b2 by each of these terms, we get terms like 6a\u00b2b\u00b2 * \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, the coefficient of a\u00b2b\u00b2 in the entire product would be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients from the second expansion, because each term in the second expansion contributes its coefficient multiplied by 6 to the coefficient of a\u00b2b\u00b2. Therefore, the total coefficient is 6 * (sum of coefficients in the second expansion).\n\nAs before, the sum of coefficients in the second expansion is (1 + 1)^6 = 64. Therefore, 6 * 64 = 384. So, the coefficient is 384.\n\nAlternatively, if I didn't realize that, I might have tried to compute the expansion of (c + 1/c)^6 and then multiplied each term by 6a\u00b2b\u00b2 and summed the coefficients, but that would just give the same result. So, I think 384 is the correct answer.\n\nWait, but let me check if I'm interpreting the problem correctly. The problem is asking for the coefficient of a\u00b2b\u00b2 in the product. Since the product is (a + b)^4 times (c + 1/c)^6, the expansion will have terms like a^k b^{4 - k} times c^m / c^n, which simplifies to a^k b^{4 - k} c^{m - n}. But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of a\u00b2b\u00b2, which is a specific term, we need to find all terms in the product where the exponents of a and b are 2 and 2, respectively. However, since the second part doesn't involve a or b, the only way to get a\u00b2b\u00b2 is to take the a\u00b2b\u00b2 term from the first part and multiply it by every term from the second part. Therefore, the coefficient of a\u00b2b\u00b2 in the product is indeed 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6*64=384.\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, I think the answer is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n\\boxed{384}"

I'm looking for the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2, which would be \\(a^2b^2\\). That means I need to find the value of \\(k\\) such that \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\).\n\nLet me calculate that: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) part is 6.\n\nNow, the expression also has \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but the term I'm looking for is \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\). So, does that mean I just need to consider the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) and multiply it by whatever coefficient comes from the other part, but since it's multiplied by the entire expression, maybe I need to consider the expansion of both parts together? Hmm, maybe not. Let me think again.\n\nWait, actually, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product. So, when I expand both parts, each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but wait, that doesn't make sense because the product would have terms involving both \\(a, b\\) and \\(c, 1/c\\). So, actually, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by every possible term from the other expansion, but since we're only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), maybe I need to consider the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because \\(c^0 = 1\\), which is the constant term. That way, when I multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by 1, I just get \\(a^2b^2\\), and the coefficient would be the product of the coefficients from both expansions.\n\nSo, first, let me find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We want the exponent of \\(c\\) to be 0, so we set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). \n\nTherefore, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). So, the coefficient from the \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) part is 20.\n\nNow, since the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\) with coefficient 6 and from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) with coefficient 20, the overall coefficient when multiplying these terms together is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nWait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake here. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the term \\(c^0\\) in the other expansion is 20, so when I multiply these two, the term \\(a^2b^2 \\times c^0\\) would be \\(6 \\times 20 a^2b^2\\), which is \\(120 a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient is 120. That seems right.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of it as the entire product being the product of two expansions, so each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, to get the term \\(a^2b^2\\), I need to take the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion and multiply it by the constant term from the second expansion, which is 20. So, 6 times 20 is indeed 120. \n\nI don't think I made any mistakes here. Let me just double-check the binomial coefficients. For \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\), that's 6, correct. For \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\), that's 20, correct. So, 6 times 20 is 120. Yeah, that should be the coefficient.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is found by multiplying the binomial coefficients from each part of the product. From \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). From \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of the constant term \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying these gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\boxed{120}"

If I expand this using the binomial theorem, the general term will be \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\\) for \\(k\\) from 0 to 4. I'm looking for the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2, so \\(a^2b^2\\). That should correspond to \\(k = 2\\) in the expansion because \\(4 - k = 2\\) when \\(k = 2\\). \n\nSo, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Let me calculate that: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient is 6 for that part.\n\nNow, the expression also has another part: \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I'm not directly looking for a term here, but since the entire expression is a product of \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), I might need to consider if the terms involving \\(c\\) affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). \n\nWait, but the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). That means I don't need to worry about the terms involving \\(c\\) because \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would just be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and it doesn't involve \\(c\\), the part with \\(c\\) would contribute a factor of 1 when considering the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\). \n\nWait, that might not be right. Let me think again. When you multiply two expressions, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression. But since I'm only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), the only way that term can come about is if I multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from \\((a + b)^4\\) by the constant term (the term with \\(c^0\\)) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because if I multiply by any other term involving \\(c\\), the resulting term would have \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or something, which isn't what we want.\n\nSo, actually, I do need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) because that's the term that, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), will give me just \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression will be 6 (from the first part) multiplied by the constant term in the second part.\n\nAlright, so let me find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying that, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m} = \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\).\n\nI need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, because that's the constant term. So, set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Let me compute that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6*6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20.\n\nNow, going back to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficients from each part. That is, 6 (from \\((a + b)^4\\)) multiplied by 20 (from the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)). So, 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, let me double-check that. So, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. In \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the constant term is 20. Since we're multiplying these two expressions together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will come from 6 * 20, which is indeed 120. So, the coefficient is 120.\n\nI think that makes sense. I don't think I made any mistakes here. The key was realizing that to get the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I needed to consider both parts of the product and specifically find the constant term in the second part because \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\). So, multiplying the coefficients together gives the final answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem.\n\nFirst, consider the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem. The general term is given by:\n\\[\n\\binom{4}{k} a^{4 - k} b^k\n\\]\nWe are looking for the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2, which corresponds to \\(k = 2\\). The coefficient for this term is:\n\\[\n\\binom{4}{2} = \\frac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\n\\]\n\nNext, we need to consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem, the general term is:\n\\[\n\\binom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\binom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n\\]\nWe need the constant term, which occurs when the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0. Solving \\(6 - 2m = 0\\) gives \\(m = 3\\). The coefficient for this term is:\n\\[\n\\binom{6}{3} = \\frac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\n\\]\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficients from each part:\n\\[\n6 \\times 20 = 120\n\\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

I need the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\). So actually, the part involving \\(c\\) might not affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) because they are separate variables. Let me think about that.\n\nSo, if I expand \\((a + b)^4\\), the term with \\(a^2b^2\\) will be one of the middle terms. Let me write that out. The expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem would be:\n\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\dbinom{4}{0}a^4 + \\dbinom{4}{1}a^3b + \\dbinom{4}{2}a^2b^2 + \\dbinom{4}{3}ab^3 + \\dbinom{4}{4}b^4\n\\]\n\nCalculating the coefficients, \\(\\dbinom{4}{0} = 1\\), \\(\\dbinom{4}{1} = 4\\), \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\), \\(\\dbinom{4}{3} = 4\\), and \\(\\dbinom{4}{4} = 1\\). So the term with \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(6a^2b^2\\). That means the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\nNow, the original expression is \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\), and \\(1/c\\) are different variables, when I multiply these two expressions together, each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nBut wait, I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). That means I don't need to worry about the \\(c\\) terms because they won't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. In other words, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression will just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since I'm only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), the coefficient remains the same as in \\((a + b)^4\\). \n\nWait, is that correct? Let me think again. When I multiply two expressions, the coefficients multiply as well. But in this case, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is multiplied by every term in the second part. However, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would include all possible combinations where the exponent of \\(a\\) is 2 and the exponent of \\(b\\) is 2, regardless of the exponent of \\(c\\). \n\nBut hold on, actually, when you multiply two polynomials, the variables are combined. So, for example, a term like \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second part, which are terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I have to consider that each term in the second expansion will multiply \\(a^2b^2\\), so the coefficient will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part.\n\nWait, that seems a bit off. Let me clarify. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, each of those terms contributes a coefficient, and since \\(a^2b^2\\) is being multiplied by each of those, the total coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) across all possible \\(c\\) terms is the product of 6 (the coefficient from the first part) and the sum of the coefficients from the second part.\n\nSo, I need to compute the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). How do I do that? Well, the sum of the coefficients in a polynomial is found by substituting 1 for all the variables. So, if I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\dfrac{1}{c} = 1\\) as well. Therefore, substituting \\(c = 1\\) into \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) gives me \\((1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). \n\nSo, the sum of the coefficients in the second part is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\nWait, but let me verify that. Because when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficients of the product are the convolutions of the coefficients of the individual polynomials. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is not just 6 times 64. It's actually 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second polynomial because each term in the second polynomial will multiply \\(a^2b^2\\), effectively scaling it by each coefficient. So, yes, that would make the total coefficient 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, another way to think about it is that when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum of the products of the coefficients of terms whose variables multiply to give that specific term. In this case, since \\(a^2b^2\\) is only in the first polynomial and not in the second, every term in the second polynomial will multiply \\(a^2b^2\\), so the coefficient becomes 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial.\n\nLet me double-check by expanding \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So the coefficients are \\(\\dbinom{6}{0} = 1\\), \\(\\dbinom{6}{1} = 6\\), \\(\\dbinom{6}{2} = 15\\), \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\), \\(\\dbinom{6}{4} = 15\\), \\(\\dbinom{6}{5} = 6\\), and \\(\\dbinom{6}{6} = 1\\). Adding these up: 1 + 6 = 7, 7 + 15 = 22, 22 + 20 = 42, 42 + 15 = 57, 57 + 6 = 63, 63 + 1 = 64. So yes, the sum of coefficients is indeed 64.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Is that the correct approach? Because when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the variables are independent, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed the coefficient from the first part times the sum of coefficients from the second part. Because each term in the second part will contribute a coefficient when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), and since we are summing over all possible terms, it's equivalent to multiplying by the total sum of coefficients.\n\nAlternatively, if I wanted to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some specific \\(k\\), that would be different. But since the problem is just asking for \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), the coefficient is the product of the coefficient from the first part and the sum of coefficients from the second part.\n\nSo, yes, 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nLet me check if this makes sense. If I have two polynomials, P(a, b) and Q(c), then the coefficient of a specific term in P(a, b) multiplied by the sum of coefficients in Q(c) would indeed be the coefficient of that term in P(a, b) times the sum of coefficients in Q(c). Because when you multiply, each term in P is multiplied by each term in Q, so the coefficient for the term in P is scaled by each coefficient in Q, and then summed over all terms in Q.\n\nTherefore, I think my approach is correct.\n\nSo, to recap:\n\n1. Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6.\n\n2. The second part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), when expanded, has coefficients that sum to 64 (found by substituting c = 1).\n\n3. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nI don't see any mistakes in this reasoning, so I think the answer is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is found using the binomial theorem, which gives 6. The sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by substituting \\(c = 1\\), resulting in 64. Multiplying these together gives \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{384}\n\\]"

So, I need to consider how this multiplication affects the coefficient.\n\nI remember that when you multiply two expressions together, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression.

However, the second part of the expression, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), so when I multiply, the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) won't interact with the terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). That means the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nWait, but actually, no. Because when you multiply two polynomials, each term from the first polynomial is multiplied by each term from the second polynomial, but in this case, since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are different variables, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will only come from the product of \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part and any term from the second part, but since the second part doesn't have \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), those terms won't affect the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but since we're looking for the coefficient, it's just the product of the coefficients.\n\nWait, no, that's not quite right. Let me think again. If I have \\((a + b)^4\\) which gives me a polynomial in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) which gives me a polynomial in \\(c\\), then when I multiply them together, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. But the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will only come from the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). However, since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), each multiplication by a term from the second polynomial will just scale the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) by the coefficient of that term in the second polynomial.\n\nWait, but that would mean the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't seem right because when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in one polynomial is multiplied by the entire other polynomial. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that would make the coefficient a polynomial in \\(c\\), not a constant.\n\nWait, but the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so perhaps I'm misunderstanding. Let me read the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, it's the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product. Since \\(c\\) and \\(a\\), \\(b\\) are different variables, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\). However, the problem is likely expecting a numerical coefficient, so perhaps I'm overcomplicating it.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\), i.e., the constant term in \\(c\\). That would make sense because otherwise, the coefficient would be a polynomial, which isn't typical in such problems. So, perhaps I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nSo, breaking it down, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, as I found earlier. Then, I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The constant term is the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. Using the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\).\n\nWe want the exponent of \\(c\\) to be zero, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\).\n\nSo, the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the second part), which is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nWait, but let me double-check that. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6a\u00b2b\u00b2, and the constant term in the second expansion is 20, so when you multiply them, you get 6 * 20 * a\u00b2b\u00b2, which is 120a\u00b2b\u00b2. So yes, the coefficient is 120.\n\nAlternatively, if I were to consider the entire expansion, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but since I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then the coefficient would indeed be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. Wait, but that's not correct because the second expansion has terms with different powers of \\(c\\), and when you multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), each term would have a different power of \\(c\\). But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not considering \\(c\\). So, perhaps the problem is expecting the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), which would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of the second polynomial, but that would make the coefficient a polynomial, which doesn't make sense. Therefore, I think the correct interpretation is that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by the constant term in \\(c\\). So, that would make the coefficient 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So, the coefficient is 120.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break it down as follows:\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term with \\(a^2b^2\\) occurs when \\(k = 2\\):\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} a^{2}b^{2} = 6a^2b^2\n   \\]\n   So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\n2. **Find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n   \\]\n   The constant term occurs when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which gives \\(m = 3\\):\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\n   \\]\n   So, the constant term is 20.\n\n3. **Multiply the coefficients:**\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the two coefficients:\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 20 = 120\n   \\]\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

    "text": " So, in this case, for \\((a + b)^4\\), I can write it as the sum from \\(k = 0\\) to \\(4\\) of \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\\).\n\nNow, I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). That means I'm looking for the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2. Let me think about what \\(k\\) would be in this case. Since the exponent of \\(b\\) is \\(k\\), if I set \\(k = 2\\), then the exponent of \\(a\\) would be \\(4 - 2 = 2\\). Perfect, that's exactly what I need.\n\nSo, the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) for the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Let me calculate that. \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) is equal to \\(\\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient from the first part is 6.\n\nNow, the original expression is \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the entire expression is the product of these two binomials raised to their respective powers. But I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). That means I don't need to worry about the \\(c\\) terms because they won't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms when multiplying. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression will just be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but since we're only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and the \\(c\\) terms are separate, the coefficient remains 6, right?\n\nWait, no, that doesn't seem right. Let me think again. Actually, when you multiply two expressions together, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression. But in this case, we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which comes only from the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), because the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), only involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), so when multiplied, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will be multiplied by every term in the second expansion. But since the problem just asks for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, I think we just need to consider the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, and the second part doesn't affect it because it's multiplied by different variables. So, the coefficient remains 6.\n\nWait, but actually, that might not be the case. Let me clarify. When you have two separate variables, the coefficients for \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are independent of \\(c\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part will be multiplied by every term in the second part, but each of those terms will have different powers of \\(c\\). However, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not considering the \\(c\\) terms. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't make sense because the coefficient can't be a polynomial; it has to be a constant. Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question.\n\nWait, no, the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, which includes all terms from both expansions. But since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. However, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually be the coefficient from the first part, 6, multiplied by the sum of all coefficients from the second part, because each term in the second expansion will multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term, and we need to sum all those contributions.\n\nWait, but that's not correct either. Let me think again. Actually, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, but each of those terms has a coefficient. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. But that's not quite right because the second expansion has terms with different powers of \\(c\\), and we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is just 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because each term in the second expansion will multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term, contributing their coefficients to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product.\n\nBut wait, that doesn't sound right because the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, would the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) be 6 * 64 = 384? That seems high, but let me check.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\), the coefficient would indeed be 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but since each term in that expansion is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) across all possible \\(c\\) terms would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but that seems like the coefficient would be 384. But let me think again: when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum of the products of the coefficients of terms that multiply together to give that specific term. But in this case, since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial will be multiplied by every term in the second polynomial, each contributing their own coefficient. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is indeed the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial.\n\nBut let me confirm this by considering a simpler case. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^1 (c + 1/c)^1\\). The expansion is \\((a + b)(c + 1/c)\\). The coefficient of \\(a^1b^0\\) is 1, and the coefficient of \\(c^1\\) is 1, so the coefficient of \\(a c\\) would be 1*1=1, and similarly for other terms. But if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a\\), regardless of \\(c\\), it would be 1*(1 + 1) = 2, because the \\(a\\) term is multiplied by both \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, in this case, the coefficient of \\(a\\) is 2, which is 1 (from the first part) times the sum of coefficients in the second part (which is 2). So, that seems to support the idea that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the original problem would be 6 times 64, which is 384.\n\nBut wait, let me think again. The problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but in the entire expression, this term will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 (from the first part) multiplied by each coefficient from the second part, but since each term in the second part is a different power of \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which would indeed be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. So, 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nBut wait, another way to think about it is that since the variables \\(a, b, c\\) are independent, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is just the product of the coefficients from each part. So, the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the coefficient from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is... Wait, but \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) doesn't have a single coefficient; it's a sum of terms with different powers of \\(c\\). So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nBut wait, let me check this with a different approach. Let's expand \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem. The expansion is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(1/c\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). The sum of all coefficients in this expansion is when \\(c = 1\\), which is \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of coefficients is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but I'm not sure if that's correct because when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a term in the product is the sum of the products of coefficients of terms that multiply to give that term. But in this case, since \\(a^2b^2\\) is being multiplied by every term in the second expansion, each of those terms contributes their coefficient to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. So, yes, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Since \\(a, b, c\\) are independent variables, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is just the product of the coefficients from each part. But the second part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), when expanded, has terms with coefficients, but since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me think again. If I have \\((a + b)^4\\) times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), then the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part, each of which has a coefficient. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, without considering the \\(c\\) terms, which would indeed be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me think of it another way. Suppose I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = (1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). Then, the entire expression becomes \\((a + b)^4 * 64\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in this would be 6 * 64 = 384. So, that seems to confirm it.\n\nBut wait, another approach: Let's consider that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\) because when \\(c^k\\) and \\(c^{-k}\\) multiply, we get \\(c^0\\). So, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) would be 6 * 20 = 120. But wait, the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, if we're considering all possible powers of \\(c\\), then the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. But if we're only considering the term where \\(c^0\\), then it would be 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, now I'm confused because the problem didn't specify any condition on \\(c\\). It just says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\". So, in the product, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part, which has different powers of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the sum over all \\(m\\) of \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}\\), where \\(m\\) is the exponent for \\(1/c\\), but since we're only considering the coefficient, it's 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but another perspective: The problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which is a polynomial in \\(a, b, c\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) can be combined with any power of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by the coefficient from the first part. So, yes, 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to consider only the term where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out, i.e., \\(c^0\\), which would be the term where \\(m = 3\\), giving \\(c^{6 - 2*3} = c^0\\). In that case, the coefficient would be 6 * \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\) = 6 * 20 = 120. But the problem didn't specify anything about \\(c\\), so I think it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), which would be 384.\n\nWait, but let me check the problem statement again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" It doesn't specify any condition on \\(c\\), so it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, which includes all possible powers of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nBut wait, let me think again. If I expand \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) separately, then multiply them, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, which has coefficients \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\) for each \\(m\\) from 0 to 6. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 * (sum from m=0 to 6 of \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\)) = 6 * 2^6 = 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So, the coefficient is 384.\n\nWait, but another way to see it is that the entire expression is a product of two polynomials, and the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial and the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial. So, 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nSo, after all that, I think the coefficient is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is found using the binomial theorem: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). The entire expression includes \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), whose sum of coefficients is \\(2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n\\boxed{384}"

I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, which means I have to consider how this multiplication affects the term \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, actually, since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), the variables \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) won't affect the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). So, does that mean the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\n\nWait, no, that's not quite right. Because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\), but when you multiply it by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), you get terms involving \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) and \\(a^2b^2 \\cdot c^{-k}\\) for various \\(k\\).

That is, when you multiply out the entire expression, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by some combination of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), but the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the sum of all the coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) multiplied by 6.\n\nWait, that makes sense. Because when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) gets multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by every term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient, not the entire expression. So maybe I'm misunderstanding the question.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), meaning the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. That is, when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by terms from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), you only consider the term where the powers of \\(c\\) cancel out, resulting in \\(c^0\\). So, the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nAh, that makes more sense. So, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is the constant term with respect to \\(c\\). So, I need to compute two things: the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Then, multiply those two coefficients together to get the final answer.\n\nAlright, so let's compute the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Again, using the binomial theorem, this expansion is:\n\n\\[\n\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n\\]\n\nWe need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be zero, so we set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\):\n\n\\[\n6 - 2k = 0 \\\\\n2k = 6 \\\\\nk = 3\n\\]\n\nSo, the term where \\(k = 3\\) will be the constant term.

So, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). In \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the constant term is when the exponent is zero, which occurs at \\(k = 3\\), and \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, multiplying 6 and 20 gives 120. That seems correct.\n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we start by using the binomial theorem on \\((a + b)^4\\):\n\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n\\]\n\nThe term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2 is when \\(k = 2\\):\n\n\\[\n\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\n\\]\n\nNext, we consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):\n\n\\[\n\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n\\]\n\nWe need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, which occurs when \\(6 - 2k = 0\\):\n\n\\[\n6 - 2k = 0 \\implies k = 3\n\\]\n\nThe coefficient of this term is:\n\n\\[\n\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\n\\]\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the product of the coefficients from both expansions:\n\n\\[\n6 \\times 20 = 120\n\\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}."

Using the binomial theorem, the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) will have terms like \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\\) for \\(k = 0\\) to \\(4\\). So, when \\(k = 2\\), the term will be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} a^{2}b^{2}\\). Let me calculate that coefficient: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\nBut wait, the problem isn't just about \\((a + b)^4\\); it's multiplied by another expression, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I think I need to consider both expansions together. But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which only comes from the \\((a + b)^4\\) part. The other part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), so when I multiply the two expressions, the \\(c\\) terms won't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms, right? So, maybe the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just the same as in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6. But I'm not sure if I'm missing something here.\n\nWait, no, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think again. The expression is a product of two separate binomial expansions. So, when I multiply them together, each term in the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But since I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I don't need to worry about the \\(c\\) terms because \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be the same as in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, no, that doesn't make sense because the \\(c\\) terms would affect the overall expression. So, maybe I'm wrong.\n\nWait, actually, when you multiply two expressions together, each term from the first expression is multiplied by each term from the second. So, if I'm looking for a specific term, say \\(a^2b^2\\), then I have to consider all possible ways that \\(a^2b^2\\) can be formed by multiplying terms from both expressions. But in this case, the first expression is \\((a + b)^4\\), which only has terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the second expression is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which only has terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, when I multiply them, each term from the first will be multiplied by each term from the second, but the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first will be multiplied by each term in the second. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), those terms in the second expression don't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) exponents. So, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will just have a coefficient equal to the coefficient in the first expression multiplied by the entire second expression. Wait, no, that doesn't sound right because the second expression is being multiplied as a whole.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to clarify. Let me denote the first part as \\(A = (a + b)^4\\) and the second part as \\(B = \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Then, the product is \\(A \\times B\\). Now, \\(A\\) has a term \\(a^2b^2\\) with coefficient 6, and \\(B\\) has various terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, when I multiply \\(A\\) and \\(B\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(A\\) will be multiplied by every term in \\(B\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product. Wait, but \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term from \\(A\\), and when multiplied by \\(B\\), it becomes \\(a^2b^2 \\times\\) (each term in \\(B\\)). So, in the product \\(A \\times B\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in \\(B\\), resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), etc. But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not considering any \\(c\\) terms. Wait, that can't be right because \\(a^2b^2\\) would only be present if \\(B\\) contributes a term that is \\(c^0\\), which is 1, because otherwise, the term would have some power of \\(c\\).\n\nWait, so maybe I need to find the term in \\(B\\) that is \\(c^0\\), because when I multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by that term, it would result in \\(a^2b^2 \\times 1\\), which is just \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(B\\). So, first, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nAlright, let's work on that. The expression is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Again, using the binomial theorem, this expands to \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k\\). Simplifying each term, that becomes \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} c^{-k} = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\).\n\nWe need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} c^{0}\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(B\\) is 20.\n\nNow, going back to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(A \\times B\\) is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(A\\) multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(B\\), which is 6 times 20, so 120.\n\nWait, let me double-check that. So, in \\(A = (a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. In \\(B = \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. So, when I multiply \\(A\\) and \\(B\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from \\(A\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(B\\). But only the term with \\(c^0\\) in \\(B\\) will contribute to a term with \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, because any other term would have a power of \\(c\\), making it \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some \\(k\\), which isn't just \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient is indeed 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Suppose I have \\(A \\times B\\), and I'm looking for the term \\(a^2b^2\\). Since \\(A\\) has \\(a^2b^2\\) and \\(B\\) has \\(c^0\\), the product will have \\(a^2b^2 \\times c^0 = a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient is the product of the coefficients from \\(A\\) and \\(B\\), which is 6 * 20 = 120. That makes sense.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can approach it differently. Let me consider the entire expansion. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). When expanding this, each term will be of the form \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}a^{4 - k}b^{k} \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - m}(1/c)^m\\). Simplifying the \\(c\\) terms, it becomes \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}\\dbinom{6}{m} a^{4 - k}b^{k} c^{6 - 2m}\\).\n\nNow, we want the term where \\(a^2b^2\\), which implies that \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). So, \\(k = 2\\), which gives the coefficient \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Now, for the \\(c\\) terms, we want the exponent to be 0, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which gives \\(m = 3\\). The coefficient from \\(B\\) when \\(m = 3\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, the total coefficient is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nYes, that seems consistent. So, I think the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120.\n\nWait, but just to make sure I didn't make any calculation mistakes, let me verify the binomial coefficients again.\n\nFor \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). That's correct because 4 choose 2 is 6.\n\nFor \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is when \\(k = 3\\), so \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). That's correct because 6 choose 3 is 20.\n\nSo, multiplying them together, 6 * 20 = 120. That's correct.\n\nI think that's the right answer. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Multiplying these gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\boxed{120}"

But wait, the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I need to consider how this multiplication affects the coefficient.\n\nLet me denote \\(E = (a + b)^4\\) and \\(F = \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\(E \\times F\\). But since \\(E\\) and \\(F\\) don't share any common variables (E has a and b, F has c and 1/c), the multiplication of these two expressions will result in terms that are products of terms from E and terms from F. However, since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), we can consider the part of E that gives \\(a^2b^2\\) and then multiply it by the entire expansion of F, because F doesn't affect the a and b terms. \n\nWait, is that correct? Let me think. Since F is multiplied by every term in E, but we're only interested in the terms where the a and b parts are \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) from E, when multiplied by F, will contribute \\(6a^2b^2 \\times F\\). Since F is a polynomial in c and 1/c, it doesn't affect the a and b parts. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product will be 6 times the entire expansion of F, but since we're only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term independent of c, we can think of it as 6 multiplied by the constant term in F. Wait, no, because F is multiplied by each term in E, but we're only interested in the term where E contributes \\(a^2b^2\\), and F can contribute any term, but since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of c's exponent, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will just be 6 times the entire F, but since F is a separate variable, maybe I'm overcomplicating.\n\nWait, no, perhaps I should think differently. The product \\(E \\times F\\) will have terms like \\(a^kb^{4 - k} \\times c^m\\) or \\(a^kb^{4 - k} \\times c^{-m}\\), but since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of c, then the coefficient will be the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in E multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in F. Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in F, each term in F contributes a coefficient, and since \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term, the total coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) across all terms in the product will be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in F.\n\nWait, but that might not be correct because F has terms with different powers of c, but the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of c. So, in the product, each term in E is multiplied by each term in F, so the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) from E is multiplied by each term in F, which is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be 6 times the sum of the coefficients of all terms in F, because each term in F is a coefficient times some power of c, but since we're only interested in \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of c's exponent, the total coefficient will be 6 multiplied by the sum of the coefficients in F.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should think of it as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in E times the sum of all coefficients in F. Because when you multiply, each term in E is multiplied by each term in F, so the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) times any term in F will contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of c's power. Therefore, the total coefficient is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in F.\n\nBut wait, the sum of the coefficients in F is found by setting c = 1. So, let's compute F at c = 1: \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the sum of the coefficients in F is 64. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me check that again. Alternatively, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term in the product of E and F. Since E has terms with a and b, and F has terms with c and 1/c, the product will have terms like \\(a^kb^{4 - k}c^m\\) or \\(a^kb^{4 - k}c^{-m}\\). So, when we look for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), we're considering all terms where the a and b exponents are 2 each, regardless of the exponent on c. Therefore, the coefficient is indeed the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in E multiplied by the entire expansion of F, because each term in F will multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term, giving terms like \\(a^2b^2c^m\\) and \\(a^2b^2c^{-m}\\), each with coefficients. So, the total coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) across all powers of c is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in F.\n\nBut the sum of the coefficients in F is 64, as I calculated earlier. So, 6 * 64 = 384. Therefore, the coefficient is 384.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. Alternatively, maybe I should think about how the product works. Each term in E is multiplied by each term in F. So, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) in E is multiplied by each term in F, which is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^6 \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the product will have terms like \\(6a^2b^2 \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is indeed 6 times the sum of all coefficients in F, because each term in F contributes a coefficient when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), and since we're summing over all m, the total coefficient is 6 times the sum of F's coefficients.\n\nSo, the sum of F's coefficients is when c = 1, which is \\( (1 + 1/1)^6 = 2^6 = 64 \\). So, 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only considering terms where the exponents of a and b are 2 each, but the exponents of c can be anything, so the coefficient is just 6 times the entire F, but since F is a polynomial, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the entire F, but that doesn't make sense because F is a polynomial in c, so the coefficient would actually be 6 times each coefficient in F, but that would be if we're collecting like terms in c. But the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of c. So, in that case, the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in F, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me try another approach. Let me expand both expressions separately and then see how the coefficients multiply.\n\nFirst, as I did before, \\((a + b)^4\\) has a term \\(6a^2b^2\\). Now, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) can be expanded using the binomial theorem as well:\n\n\\[\n\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n\\]\n\nSo, the expansion is:\n\n\\[\nc^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15c^{-2} + 6c^{-4} + c^{-6}\n\\]\n\nNow, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the product will have terms like \\(6a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(6a^2b^2c^4\\), \\(6a^2b^2c^2\\), \\(6a^2b^2\\), \\(6a^2b^2c^{-2}\\), \\(6a^2b^2c^{-4}\\), and \\(6a^2b^2c^{-6}\\).\n\nNow, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, in the product, \\(a^2b^2\\) can be multiplied by any power of c, but the term \\(a^2b^2\\) itself (without any c) is when the exponent of c is 0, which occurs in the middle term of the expansion of F, which is 20. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, that contradicts my earlier conclusion of 384. Hmm, so where did I go wrong earlier? Let me check.\n\nI think the confusion arises from whether the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of c or just the term \\(a^2b^2\\) without any c. If it's the former, meaning the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for any k, then the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of F, which would be 6 * 64 = 384. But if it's the latter, meaning the coefficient of exactly \\(a^2b^2\\) (with c^0), then it's 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but the problem says: \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\". Typically, in such problems, unless specified otherwise, it refers to the term where the exponents of a and b are 2 each, regardless of other variables. However, in this case, since the expression includes c and 1/c, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would have to be multiplied by c^0 to be exactly \\(a^2b^2\\). So, perhaps the correct approach is to consider only the term where the exponent of c is 0.\n\nWait, but let me read the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, in the entire product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) can be multiplied by any power of c, but the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is the term where the exponents of a and b are 2 each, regardless of c's exponent. So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in F, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nBut wait, in my second approach, I considered that the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product must have c^0, which gives 120. So, which is correct?\n\nI think the confusion comes from whether the problem is considering \\(a^2b^2\\) as a term independent of c, or as a term with any power of c. If it's the former, then the coefficient is 120. If it's the latter, then it's 384.\n\nWait, perhaps I should look for an example. Let me consider a simpler case. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, expanding:\n\n\\((a + b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2\\).\n\n\\((c + 1/c)^1 = c + 1/c\\).\n\nMultiplying them together: \\(a^2c + a^2/c + 2abc + 2ab/c + b^2c + b^2/c\\).\n\nNow, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be zero because there is no \\(a^2b^2\\) term. But wait, in this case, \\((a + b)^2\\) only goes up to \\(b^2\\), so when multiplied by (c + 1/c), the terms are like \\(a^2c\\), \\(a^2/c\\), etc., but no \\(a^2b^2\\) term. So, in this case, the coefficient is zero.\n\nBut if I take \\((a + b)^4 \\times (c + 1/c)^6\\), and I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I think the problem is asking for the coefficient of the term where a is squared and b is squared, regardless of the power of c. So, in that case, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\((c + 1/c)^6\\), so the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) from \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\((c + 1/c)^6\\), resulting in terms like \\(6a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(6a^2b^2c^4\\), etc. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^6\\) is 6, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^4\\) is 6, and so on, up to \\(a^2b^2c^{-6}\\), each with coefficient 6. Therefore, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of c, then the total coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\((c + 1/c)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nHowever, if the problem is asking specifically for the term \\(a^2b^2\\) without any c, then we need to find the term where the exponent of c is zero. In \\((c + 1/c)^6\\), the term with c^0 is the middle term, which is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}c^{0} = 20\\). So, the coefficient would be 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nBut I'm not sure which interpretation is correct. Let me check the problem statement again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" It doesn't specify any particular power of c, so perhaps it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of c, which would mean summing over all possible c exponents, giving 384.\n\nWait, but in the example I did earlier with \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be zero, because there's no such term. But in our problem, \\((a + b)^4\\) has \\(a^2b^2\\), and when multiplied by \\((c + 1/c)^6\\), each term in F is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for any k is 6. So, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, meaning the sum of all coefficients where a^2b^2 is present, regardless of c, then it's 6 times the sum of coefficients in F, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nBut wait, another way to think about it is that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in E times the sum of all coefficients in F, because each term in F is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), so the total coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of the term \\(a^2b^2\\) without any c, then it's 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nI think I need to clarify this. Let me check an authoritative source or think about how such problems are typically interpreted.\n\nIn problems like this, when they ask for the coefficient of a specific term in a product of polynomials, they usually mean the coefficient of that exact term, considering all variables. So, if the term is \\(a^2b^2\\), it would imply that the exponents of a and b are 2 each, and the exponents of c are zero. Therefore, the coefficient would be 120.\n\nWait, but in the problem statement, the expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times (c + 1/c)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would have to be multiplied by \\(c^0\\) to be exactly \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nBut earlier, I thought that if you're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of c, then it's 384. But perhaps the standard interpretation is that the coefficient is for the term where all variables have the specified exponents, including any other variables present. But in this case, since the term \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve c, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times any power of c, which would be 384.\n\nWait, but in the product, each term in E is multiplied by each term in F, so the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term in F, resulting in terms like \\(6a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(6a^2b^2c^4\\), etc. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^6\\) is 6, and the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^4\\) is 6, etc. Therefore, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of c, then the total coefficient is 6 * (sum of coefficients in F) = 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nBut if the problem is asking for the coefficient of exactly \\(a^2b^2\\) (i.e., with c^0), then it's 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nI think I need to decide which interpretation is correct. In most cases, when a problem asks for the coefficient of a specific term in a product of polynomials, it's referring to the term where all variables have the specified exponents. So, in this case, since the term \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve c, the problem is probably asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nBut to be thorough, let me check both approaches.\n\nFirst approach: Coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of c.\n\n- Coefficient in E: 6\n- Sum of coefficients in F: 64\n- Total coefficient: 6 * 64 = 384\n\nSecond approach: Coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\).\n\n- Coefficient in E: 6\n- Coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in F: 20\n- Total coefficient: 6 * 20 = 120\n\nI think the problem is more likely asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), so the answer is 120. But I'm not entirely sure. Let me think of another way to approach this.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can consider that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, which would include all terms where a and b are squared, regardless of the power of c. So, that would mean that each term in F is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), so the total coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in F, which is 384.\n\nWait, but if that's the case, then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 384, but that seems high. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only considering terms where the exponents of a and b are 2, and the exponents of c are zero, making it 120.\n\nI think I need to look for a more precise interpretation. Let me think of the problem as: when you multiply the two expressions, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) can be paired with any term from F, which includes various powers of c. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the sum of all coefficients from F multiplied by 6. So, that would be 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but that would mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 384, which is the same as the sum of all coefficients in the product for \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by any c term.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without considering c, then it's 120.\n\nI think I need to decide based on standard problem conventions. Typically, when a problem asks for the coefficient of a term in a product, it's referring to the term with exactly those exponents in all variables. So, in this case, since the term \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve c, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is 120.\n\nWait, but let me confirm this with another example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, the expansion is:\n\n\\((a^2 + 2ab + b^2)(c + 1/c)\\) = \\(a^2c + a^2/c + 2abc + 2ab/c + b^2c + b^2/c\\).\n\nNow, if I'm asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), there is none, so it's zero. But if I'm asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), it's also zero because there's no such term.\n\nWait, but in our original problem, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is present in E, and when multiplied by F, it's multiplied by each term in F, giving terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), etc. So, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of c, then it's 384. But if it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), it's 120.\n\nI think the key is whether the problem is considering c as part of the term or not. Since the problem mentions only \\(a^2b^2\\), without specifying c, it's ambiguous. However, in most problems, unless specified, the coefficient is for the exact term, including all variables. So, in this case, since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve c, the coefficient would be 6 times the constant term in F, which is 20, giving 120.\n\nTherefore, I think the correct answer is 120.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the sum of coefficients of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for all k, which would be 6 * 64 = 384. But now I'm thinking that the problem is asking for \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nI need to resolve this confusion. Let me check the problem statement again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" It doesn't specify any exponent for c, so perhaps it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of c, meaning that we sum over all possible exponents of c. Therefore, the coefficient would be 6 * (sum of coefficients in F) = 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem had asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it would be 120. Since it's just asking for \\(a^2b^2\\), I think it's the former interpretation, so the answer is 384.\n\nWait, but in the example I did earlier, \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be zero, which aligns with the idea that if you don't specify c, you're looking for the term where a and b have those exponents regardless of c, but in that case, the term doesn't exist because E doesn't have \\(a^2b^2\\). So, perhaps in our problem, since E does have \\(a^2b^2\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of c would be 384.\n\nI think I need to stick with the interpretation that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of c, so the answer is 384.\n\nWait, but now I'm confused because earlier I thought it was 120. Let me try to approach this differently. Let me consider that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, meaning the sum of all coefficients where a is squared and b is squared, regardless of the power of c. Therefore, each term in F contributes a coefficient when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), so the total coefficient is 6 times the sum of coefficients in F, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nTherefore, I think the correct answer is 384.\n\nBut wait, let me check this with the example again. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^4 \\times (c + 1/c)^6\\). The term \\(a^2b^2\\) from E is multiplied by each term in F, which has coefficients 1, 6, 15, 20, 15, 6, 1. So, the total contribution to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6*(1 + 6 + 15 + 20 + 15 + 6 + 1) = 6*64 = 384.\n\nYes, that makes sense. Therefore, the coefficient is 384.\n\nWait, but in the earlier part of my thought process, I thought it was 120, but now I'm convinced it's 384. So, I think the correct answer is 384.\n\nBut wait, let me think again. If the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term in the product, then in the product, \\(a^2b^2\\) can be multiplied by any term from F, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), etc. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the sum of the coefficients of all such terms, which is 6*(sum of coefficients in F) = 384.\n\nTherefore, I conclude that the coefficient is 384.\n\nWait, but I'm now confused because I initially thought it was 120, but upon further reflection, it's 384. I think the key is whether the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of c or specifically \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). Since it's not specified, I think it's the former, so the answer is 384.\n\nBut to be absolutely sure, let me look up similar problems. Typically, when a problem asks for the coefficient of a term in a product of polynomials, it's referring to the coefficient of that exact term, considering all variables. So, in this case, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), it's likely referring to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nWait, but in the product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term in F, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the sum of coefficients of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for all k, which is 6*(sum of coefficients in F) = 384.\n\nI think I need to accept that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of c, so the answer is 384.\n\nBut I'm still not entirely confident. Let me try to compute it another way. Let me consider that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the product of the coefficients of \\(a^2b^2\\) in E and the sum of coefficients in F. Since E has 6 as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and F has a sum of coefficients equal to 64, then 6*64=384.\n\nYes, that makes sense. Therefore, the coefficient is 384.\n\nWait, but in the expansion of F, the sum of coefficients is when c=1, which is 2^6=64. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6*64=384.\n\nTherefore, I think the correct answer is 384.\n\nBut I'm still a bit unsure because I initially thought it was 120, but upon re-evaluating, I think 384 is correct.\n\nWait, let me try to compute it step by step again.\n\n1. Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using binomial theorem: \\(a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\).\n\n2. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6.\n\n3. Expand \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\): sum_{k=0}^6 \\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6-2k}.\n\n4. The sum of coefficients in F is when c=1: 2^6=64.\n\n5. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6*64=384.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by expanding each part separately and then combining the results.\n\n1. Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\n   \\]\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6.\n\n2. Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem:\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n   \\]\n   The sum of the coefficients is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), resulting in \\(2^6 = 64\\).\n\n3. Multiply the coefficient from step 1 by the sum from step 2:\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 64 = 384\n   \\]\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\boxed{384}."

    "text": " So, for \\((a + b)^4\\), I can write it as \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\\).\n\nNow, I'm specifically looking for the term where \\(a^2b^2\\). So, I need to find the value of \\(k\\) such that \\(a^{4 - k}b^k = a^2b^2\\). That means \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Let me calculate that: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient from the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), is 6.\n\nNext, I need to consider the second part of the expression, which is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I'm a bit confused here because I'm looking for a term involving \\(a^2b^2\\), but this part has \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). Wait, but maybe these two parts are multiplied together, so the entire expression is a product of two expansions. So, perhaps I need to consider the product of terms from both expansions.\n\nWait, but the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Hmm, that suggests that maybe the terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) don't affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), because \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\). So, maybe the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but since we're only interested in the \\(a^2b^2\\) term, perhaps the coefficient is just 6 times whatever the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is. Wait, no, that doesn't make sense because when you multiply two polynomials, each term from the first polynomial gets multiplied by each term from the second polynomial.\n\nWait, but in this case, the variables are different. The first part is in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the second part is in \\(c\\). So, when you multiply them together, the terms will involve products of \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\), and \\(1/c\\). But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, that means for each term in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is \\(a^2b^2\\) with coefficient 6, when multiplied by any term from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the resulting term will have \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by some power of \\(c\\). But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, maybe we just need to consider the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and then multiply it by the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Wait, that might not be correct because each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion.\n\nWait, but the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\). So, substituting \\(c = 1\\), we get \\((1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of all coefficients in the second part is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 times 64, which is 384. But wait, that seems too straightforward. Let me check if I'm making a mistake here.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are different variables, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, perhaps it's just 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me think again. When you multiply two polynomials, each term from the first is multiplied by each term from the second. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial because each term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by every term in the second polynomial, which has coefficients summing to 64. So, 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without considering any \\(c\\) terms, which would mean that the coefficient is just 6, but that doesn't seem right because when you multiply by the second polynomial, each term in the first gets multiplied by each term in the second, so the coefficient would indeed be 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me check by expanding both parts. Let's see, \\((a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. Now, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) can be expanded as \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(1/c\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). The sum of all coefficients is when \\(c = 1\\), so that's 2^6 = 64, as I thought earlier.\n\nSo, when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but that seems high. Let me think differently. Maybe I'm supposed to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where \\(c\\) cancels out to \\(c^0 = 1\\). In that case, I would need to find the term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, because then when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), it would give a term with \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). So, that might be a different approach.\n\nLet me try that. The term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0 in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) occurs when \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), so \\(k = 3\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire product would be 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, so which is it? The problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", without specifying anything about \\(c\\). So, does that mean it's considering all possible powers of \\(c\\), or just the constant term with respect to \\(c\\)? Hmm, that's ambiguous. Let me check the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)\". So, it's the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, that would mean that for each term in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is \\(a^2b^2\\) with coefficient 6, when multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 64, giving 384.\n\nBut wait, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\), then it's just 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part, so the coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it's 6 * 20 = 120. But the problem didn't specify anything about \\(c\\), so I think it's the first interpretation, that it's 384.\n\nWait, but let me think again. If the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\), then yes, it's 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, so 6*64=384.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me try to write the product as \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). When expanding this product, each term from \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by every term from the second part, which includes \\(c^6\\), \\(c^4\\), \\(c^2\\), \\(c^0\\), \\(c^{-2}\\), etc. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part (which is 6) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part (which is 64). So, 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but that seems correct because when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in one polynomial is multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the other polynomial. So, yes, I think 384 is the correct answer.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let me check with a different approach. Let's consider that \\((a + b)^4 = \\sum_{i=0}^4 \\dbinom{4}{i} a^{4 - i}b^i\\) and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = \\sum_{j=0}^6 \\dbinom{6}{j} c^{6 - j}(1/c)^j = \\sum_{j=0}^6 \\dbinom{6}{j} c^{6 - 2j}\\). Now, when we multiply these two, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\(i = 2\\) in the first sum, which gives \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\\). Then, when multiplied by each term in the second sum, which is \\(\\sum_{j=0}^6 \\dbinom{6}{j} c^{6 - 2j}\\), the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second sum, which is \\(\\sum_{j=0}^6 \\dbinom{6}{j} = 2^6 = 64\\). So, 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 384.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit uncertain because sometimes when variables are involved, people might interpret the problem differently. But in this case, since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are separate variables, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would indeed be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 64. So, 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nSo, after going through this step-by-step, I think the answer is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplying it by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 64. Thus, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n\\boxed{384}"

The term \\(a^2b^2\\) is just a term in the first part, and when multiplied by the entire second part, which is a polynomial in \\(c\\), the result will be a product where each term has \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by some term involving \\(c\\).

Find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nThen, multiply these two coefficients together to get the final coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression.\n\nAlright, let's tackle the second part: finding the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Again, I can use the binomial theorem for this. The binomial expansion is:\n\n\\[\n\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k\n\\]\n\nSimplifying each term, that becomes:\n\n\\[\n\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} c^{-k} = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n\\]\n\nWe need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero because that's the constant term. So, we set the exponent equal to zero:\n\n\\[\n6 - 2k = 0\n\\]\n\nSolving for \\(k\\):\n\n\\[\n6 = 2k \\implies k = 3\n\\]\n\nSo, the constant term is when \\(k = 3\\). The coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\), which is 20. Let me check that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). Yep, that's correct.\n\nSo, the constant term is 20. Now, going back to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6, and the constant term in the second part is 20. Since these two are multiplied together in the overall expression, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nWait, let me just make sure I didn't make a mistake here. So, when you multiply two expressions, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), we only consider the term in the second expansion that is constant (i.e., doesn't have any \\(c\\) in it). That makes sense because any term with \\(c\\) would introduce a \\(c\\) term into the product, which we don't want since we're only looking for \\(a^2b^2\\).\n\nTherefore, the coefficient is indeed the product of the two coefficients: 6 and 20, giving 120. I think that's correct. Let me just recap to ensure I didn't skip any steps.\n\n1. Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is 6.\n2. Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem and find the constant term, which occurs when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. That happens at \\(k = 3\\), giving a coefficient of 20.\n3. Multiply the two coefficients together: 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem.\n\nFirst, we expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\dbinom{4}{0}a^4 + \\dbinom{4}{1}a^3b + \\dbinom{4}{2}a^2b^2 + \\dbinom{4}{3}ab^3 + \\dbinom{4}{4}b^4\n\\]\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n\nNext, we expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem:\n\\[\n\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n\\]\nWe need the constant term, which occurs when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero:\n\\[\n6 - 2k = 0 \\implies k = 3\n\\]\nThe coefficient of the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n\nFinally, we multiply the coefficients from both expansions:\n\\[\n6 \\times 20 = 120\n\\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

    "text": " So, maybe I can apply that here.\n\nLet me start with the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\). Using the binomial theorem, the expansion will be:\n\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\dbinom{4}{0}a^4 + \\dbinom{4}{1}a^3b + \\dbinom{4}{2}a^2b^2 + \\dbinom{4}{3}ab^3 + \\dbinom{4}{4}b^4\n\\]\n\nCalculating the coefficients, I know that \\(\\dbinom{4}{0} = 1\\), \\(\\dbinom{4}{1} = 4\\), \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\), \\(\\dbinom{4}{3} = 4\\), and \\(\\dbinom{4}{4} = 1\\). So, the expansion becomes:\n\n\\[\na^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\n\\]\n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) here is 6. But wait, the problem is asking for the coefficient in the product of two expressions: \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). That means I need to consider the entire product, not just \\((a + b)^4\\) alone.\n\nHmm, so maybe I should first find the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) as well, and then see how the multiplication affects the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). But wait, \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are variables separate from \\(c\\), so when I multiply the two expressions, the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) won't interact with the terms involving \\(c\\). That is, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables, their exponents won't affect the \\(c\\) terms. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product will just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nWait, is that right? Let me think. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6a\u00b2b\u00b2, and when I multiply this by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) will be multiplied by 6a\u00b2b\u00b2. So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product will be 6 multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nBut wait, is that correct? Because each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is of the form \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - k}\\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, each term has a coefficient of \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}\\) and a power of \\(c\\) as \\(6 - 2k\\). But when I multiply 6a\u00b2b\u00b2 by each of these terms, the \\(c\\) terms will just tag along, but the \\(a^2b^2\\) term's coefficient will be multiplied by each \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}\\).\n\nWait, but the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, in the entire product, every term that has \\(a^2b^2\\) will have a coefficient of 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Therefore, I need to compute the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is found by setting \\(c = 1\\). Because substituting \\(c = 1\\) into the expression will make each term equal to its coefficient.\n\nSo, let's compute that. If I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = (2)^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 64.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). So, the answer should be 384.\n\nWait, let me double-check that. So, \\((a + b)^4\\) gives a term \\(6a^2b^2\\), and when multiplied by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which has a total coefficient sum of 64, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in the expansion, each with their own coefficients. But since the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, then yes, it's 6 multiplied by 64.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of it as the product of the two expansions. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion is 6a\u00b2b\u00b2, and when multiplied by each term in the second expansion, which is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in the second expansion is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, when I multiply 6a\u00b2b\u00b2 by each of these, I get terms like \\(6 \\dbinom{6}{k} a^2b^2 c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, every such term will have \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by some coefficient. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) across all terms will be the sum of all the coefficients from the second expansion, which is 64, multiplied by 6. So, 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, I think the coefficient is 384.\n\nWait, just to make sure, let me consider an alternative approach. Maybe using generating functions or considering the product directly.\n\nAlternatively, since the variables are independent, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 64. So, 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nYes, that seems consistent.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think about it as the product of two polynomials: one in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and another in \\(c\\). So, when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in one polynomial is multiplied by the sum of coefficients in the other polynomial. So, since \\(a^2b^2\\) is in the first polynomial, its coefficient is 6, and the sum of coefficients in the second polynomial is 64, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nYes, that makes sense.\n\nWait, but let me check if I'm not missing anything. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression. So, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the \\(6a^2b^2\\) term in \\((a + b)^4\\), and when multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), it gives \\(6a^2b^2\\) multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, so 6*64=384.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think about specific terms. Let me expand \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem:\n\n\\[\n\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n\\]\n\nSo, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, when I multiply this by \\(6a^2b^2\\), I get:\n\n\\[\n6a^2b^2 \\times \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k} = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} 6 \\dbinom{6}{k} a^2b^2 c^{6 - 2k}\n\\]\n\nSo, every term in this sum has \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by some coefficient and some power of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the sum of all the coefficients from the second expansion, which is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} 6 \\dbinom{6}{k}\\). But \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} = 2^6 = 64\\), so the total coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nYes, that's consistent with what I thought earlier.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me compute \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k}\\). That's equal to \\(2^6 = 64\\), which is correct because the sum of binomial coefficients for a given n is \\(2^n\\).\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nSo, I think that's the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{384}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem and properties of polynomial multiplication.\n\nFirst, we expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\dbinom{4}{0}a^4 + \\dbinom{4}{1}a^3b + \\dbinom{4}{2}a^2b^2 + \\dbinom{4}{3}ab^3 + \\dbinom{4}{4}b^4\n\\]\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in this expansion is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n\nNext, we consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem, we have:\n\\[\n\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n\\]\nThe sum of the coefficients in this expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives:\n\\[\n\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\n\\]\n\nWhen we multiply the two expansions, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient is:\n\\[\n6 \\times 64 = 384\n\\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is \\(\\boxed{384}\\)."

    "text": " So, maybe I can apply that here.\n\nWait, but the expression isn't just \\((a + b)^4\\); it's multiplied by another binomial \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I guess I need to expand both parts separately and then find the product. But actually, since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which only involves \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), maybe the other part with \\(c\\) doesn't affect that term? Let me think.\n\nNo, actually, when you multiply two expressions together, each term in the first expansion gets multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) won't interact with the terms involving \\(c\\).

Wait, but that doesn't make sense because when you multiply, each term from the first is multiplied by each term from the second. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of the second part. But that seems off because the second part isn't a constant. Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating it.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" Oh, maybe it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, in other words, when you multiply everything out, collect like terms, and find the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\), which can have any power of \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems too broad. Wait, no, because when you multiply, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part would be multiplied by every term in the second part, which includes various powers of \\(c\\). So, the overall expression will have terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), etc., depending on how the second expansion goes. But the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), without specifying any particular power of \\(c\\). So, does that mean we need to sum all the coefficients from the second expansion and then multiply by the coefficient from the first part? Or maybe I'm misunderstanding.\n\nWait, actually, no. Let me clarify: the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, in other words, when you expand the entire expression, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) can be multiplied by any power of \\(c\\), so the coefficient would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times each coefficient in the second expansion would contribute to the overall coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for different \\(k\\). But since the problem just asks for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\), that would mean we need to consider all the coefficients from the second expansion and sum them up, then multiply by the coefficient from the first part.\n\nWait, but that might not be correct because in the original expression, each term is a product of terms from both expansions. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\), and when multiplied by any term from the second expansion, which is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), it would result in a term \\(a^2b^2 \\times \\text{something}\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the sum of all coefficients in the second part, because each term in the second expansion contributes its own coefficient to the product. Wait, but the second part isn't just a polynomial in \\(c\\); it's a Laurent polynomial, with positive and negative powers. So, when we talk about the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), we need to consider all terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any power of \\(c\\), so the coefficient would be the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all coefficients in the second part, because each term in the second expansion has a coefficient that, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), contributes to the overall coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times that power of \\(c\\). But since the problem doesn't specify a particular power of \\(c\\), I think it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) irrespective of the power of \\(c\\), which would be the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all coefficients in the second part.\n\nWait, but that might not be accurate. Let me think again. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so in the entire expansion, every term that has \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by any power of \\(c\\) would contribute to that coefficient. So, the coefficient would be the coefficient from the first part, which is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because each term in the second expansion is a coefficient times a power of \\(c\\), and when you multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), each such term contributes its coefficient to the overall coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times that power of \\(c\\). But since the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), we can sum all those contributions by multiplying the coefficient from the first part by the sum of all coefficients in the second part.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) as a term in the product, regardless of the \\(c\\) part, so we can think of the entire expression as a product of two polynomials, one in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the other in \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that seems not quite right because the expansion of the second part is in terms of \\(c\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me try to approach this differently. Let's first find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\). Using the binomial theorem, the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\\). So, the term where \\(k=2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} a^{2}b^{2}\\), which is \\(6a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient is 6.\n\nNow, the entire expression is this multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when we multiply \\(6a^2b^2\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we get \\(6a^2b^2 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is now multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because each term in the expansion of the second part has a coefficient, and when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), each of those coefficients contributes to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times the corresponding power of \\(c\\). But since the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), we need to sum all these contributions. So, the total coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nWait, but how do we find the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)? The sum of coefficients in a polynomial is found by setting the variable to 1. So, if we set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = (2)^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of all coefficients in the expansion is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\nWait, but let me verify that. Because when you set \\(c = 1\\), you're effectively summing all the coefficients, yes. So, that seems correct. Alternatively, I can think of it as the sum of the coefficients being equal to evaluating the expression at \\(c = 1\\), which gives 2^6 = 64. So, yes, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should approach it differently. Let me expand both parts separately and see. The first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), as we saw, has a coefficient of 6 for \\(a^2b^2\\). The second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), can be expanded using the binomial theorem as \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, each term in the second expansion has a coefficient \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\) and a power of \\(c^{6 - 2m}\\).\n\nNow, when we multiply the two expansions together, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, which gives us \\(6a^2b^2 \\times \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion, which is 64, as calculated before. So, 6 \u00d7 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me check if that's correct. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^k\\) for some specific \\(k\\), but the problem doesn't specify. It just says the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so I think it's correct to consider the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion, leading to 384.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating, and the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, so the answer is 6 times the sum of coefficients in the second part, which is 64, so 384.\n\nWait, but let me think again: when you multiply two expressions, the coefficient of a specific term in one variable is the product of the coefficients of the respective terms in each expression. But in this case, since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) can be multiplied by any term in the \\(c\\) expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would indeed be the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all coefficients from the second part. So, that's 6 \u00d7 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me check with another approach. Let's consider that the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). If I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), then I can treat the \\(c\\) part as a separate variable. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't make sense because the coefficient should be a number, not a polynomial. Therefore, I must have made a mistake in my earlier reasoning.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Maybe it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) can be multiplied by any power of \\(c\\), so the coefficient would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, as each term in the second expansion contributes its coefficient to the product when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the total coefficient is 6 \u00d7 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which would be the coefficient from the first part times the entire expansion of the second part. But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, which doesn't make sense. So, I think the correct approach is to consider that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, giving 384.\n\nWait, but let me check with an example. Suppose we have \\((a + b)^1 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, expanding, we get \\((a + b)(c + 1/c)\\). The coefficient of \\(a^1b^0\\) is 1, and the coefficient of \\(a^0b^1\\) is 1. The sum of coefficients in the second part is (1 + 1) = 2. So, the coefficient of \\(a^1b^0\\) in the product would be 1 \u00d7 2 = 2, which is correct because when you expand, you get \\(a(c + 1/c) + b(c + 1/c)\\), so the coefficient of \\(a\\) times \\(c\\) is 1, and \\(a\\) times \\(1/c\\) is 1, so the coefficient of \\(a\\) is 1 \u00d7 (1 + 1) = 2, same with \\(b\\). So, yes, that approach works.\n\nTherefore, applying that to our problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 \u00d7 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not missing anything. Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the product of the coefficients from each part, but that doesn't make sense because the second part isn't a single term. So, the only way is to consider the coefficient from the first part times the sum of coefficients from the second part, which gives 384.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is considering only the constant term in the second expansion. Wait, but the problem doesn't specify that. It just asks for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so I think it's correct to include all terms. So, I think 384 is the correct answer.\n\nWait, but let me check the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) to see what the sum of coefficients is. When \\(c = 1\\), it's \\(2^6 = 64\\), which is correct. So, the sum of coefficients is 64, so 6 \u00d7 64 = 384.\n\nTherefore, I think the coefficient is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplying it by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 64. Thus, the total coefficient is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n$\\boxed{384}$"

    "text": " So, maybe I can apply that here.\n\nLooking at the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), I think I can expand this to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Let me write that out. The general term in the expansion would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\\). I need the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2, so \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). That means the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. \n\nWait, but the problem is asking for the coefficient in the entire expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Hmm, so does that mean I need to consider the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), as well? Or is it just about the \\(a^2b^2\\) term?\n\nI think I need to consider both parts because the entire expression is the product of these two expansions. So, when we multiply the two expansions together, the terms will combine. But since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first part won't be affected by the second part's terms, right? Because when you multiply, the variables have to match to combine. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression should just be the same as the coefficient in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6. \n\nWait, but I'm not entirely sure. Let me think again. So, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When you expand both, you'll have terms like \\(a^kb^{4 - k}\\) multiplied by terms like \\(c^mc^{6 - m}\\) or something. But since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), the only way \\(a^2b^2\\) can appear in the product is if we take the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part and multiply it by any term from the second part. But wait, no, because \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term with only \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the second part has only \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), so when you multiply, you'll have terms like \\(a^2b^2 \\times c^m \\times (1/c)^n\\), which would be \\(a^2b^2 c^{m - n}\\). But the original problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. \n\nWait, that might not be right. Maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me clarify: when you multiply two polynomials, the variables are combined. So, in this case, the variables are \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\), and \\(1/c\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part would be multiplied by every term in the second part, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^5 \\times (1/c)\\), and so on, down to \\(a^2b^2 \\times (1/c)^6\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, does that mean we're just looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, irrespective of what happens with \\(c\\)?\n\nWait, but that doesn't make much sense because the entire expression is a product, so the \\(a^2b^2\\) term would be multiplied by different powers of \\(c\\). So, maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times some power of \\(c\\). But the problem statement just says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", which is a bit ambiguous. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only concerned with the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, but since it's a product, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients from the second expansion. Hmm, that might be it.\n\nWait, let me think again. If I have two polynomials, say \\(P(a, b)\\) and \\(Q(c)\\), then the product \\(P(a, b) \\times Q(c)\\) would have terms where each term in \\(P\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(Q\\). So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), that would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(P(a, b)\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(Q(c)\\). But is that the case here? Wait, no, because \\(Q(c)\\) is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which when expanded, has terms with different powers of \\(c\\), but the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, in that case, the coefficient would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(P(a, b)\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(Q(c)\\), because each term in \\(Q(c)\\) would multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term, contributing to the overall coefficient.\n\nWait, but I'm not sure if that's correct. Let me try to approach it differently. Maybe the problem is intended to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by terms from \\(Q(c)\\), you might get terms where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, i.e., constant terms. So, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), which would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero.\n\nIf that's the case, then I need to compute the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, let's compute each part separately.\n\nFirst, as before, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n\nNext, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Let me expand this using the binomial theorem. The general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\times (1/c)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be zero, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\). So, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire expression is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nWait, but the problem just says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", without specifying any \\(c\\) terms. So, maybe I'm overcomplicating it by considering \\(c\\). Perhaps the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. But that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which would make the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) equal to 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which doesn't make much sense because the coefficient should be a number, not a polynomial.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is only concerned with the \\(a^2b^2\\) term and ignores the \\(c\\) terms, which would mean the coefficient is just 6. But that seems unlikely because the problem includes both parts of the product.\n\nWait, maybe I should look at the problem again. It says, \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\).\" So, perhaps the problem is indeed asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, meaning that the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would make the coefficient a polynomial in \\(c\\), which isn't a constant. So, maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\), which is 1. So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times 20, which is 120, as I calculated earlier.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is only concerned with the \\(a^2b^2\\) term and doesn't care about the \\(c\\) terms, so the coefficient is just 6. But that seems inconsistent because the entire expression includes both parts.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when the entire expression is expanded, which would include all possible combinations of \\(c\\) terms. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 times \\(2^6 = 64\\), because the sum of coefficients in a binomial expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), so \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). So, the coefficient would be 6 * 64 = 384. But that seems too high, and I'm not sure if that's the correct approach.\n\nWait, but that approach would be correct if the problem was asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, meaning that every term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), so the total coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. But I'm not sure if that's what the problem is asking.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable, so the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but that would make the coefficient a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me go back to the problem statement: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\).\" So, perhaps the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, ignoring the \\(c\\) terms, which would be 6, as found earlier. But that seems too straightforward, and I think the problem is expecting me to consider the entire product, including the \\(c\\) terms.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is intended to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but that would make the coefficient a polynomial, which doesn't make sense. So, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where the exponents of \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are 2, 2, and 0, respectively.\n\nIf that's the case, then the coefficient would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 20, as calculated earlier, so 6 * 20 = 120. That seems more plausible.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to have the \\(a^2b^2\\) term multiplied by any power of \\(c\\), so the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384. But that seems high, and I'm not sure if that's the case.\n\nWait, let me think about it differently. When you have two separate variables, \\(a, b\\) and \\(c\\), the terms in the product would be the product of terms from each expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part would be multiplied by every term from the second part, which includes different powers of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, because each term in the second expansion contributes to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). \n\nWait, but the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), so \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 * 64 = 384. But that seems like a lot, and I'm not sure if that's what the problem is asking for.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by the constant term in the second expansion. As calculated earlier, the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 20, so the coefficient would be 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, I think I need to clarify the problem. The problem says, \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\)\". So, in the entire expansion, each term would be of the form \\(a^kb^{4 - k}c^mc^{6 - m}\\), which simplifies to \\(a^kb^{4 - k}c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would correspond to \\(k=2\\), and for each \\(m\\), we'd have \\(c^{6 - 2m}\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 64, as before. So, 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nBut wait, that would mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 384, which is a constant, but when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, you get terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), etc. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion would actually be the sum of all the coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by 6. But that would make the coefficient a number, not a polynomial. So, perhaps that's the correct approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable, so the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but that doesn't make sense because the coefficient should be a number, not a polynomial.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is only considering the \\(a^2b^2\\) term and ignoring the \\(c\\) terms, so the coefficient is just 6. But that seems too simplistic, especially since the problem includes both parts of the product.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is intended to have the \\(a^2b^2\\) term multiplied by the constant term in the second expansion, so the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120. That seems plausible because then the term would be \\(a^2b^2\\), and the \\(c\\) terms would cancel out to give a constant.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of the second part, which would be a polynomial in \\(c\\). But that doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try to approach it differently. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so in the entire expansion, each term is a product of a term from \\((a + b)^4\\) and a term from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) can only come from the term in \\((a + b)^4\\) and then multiplying by any term from the second expansion, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 64. So, 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nBut that seems high, and I'm not sure if that's the correct interpretation. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and the rest is irrelevant because the problem is only about \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). But that seems inconsistent with the problem statement, which includes both parts.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is intended to have the \\(a^2b^2\\) term multiplied by the constant term in the second expansion, so the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120. That would make sense if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), which is the constant term.\n\nI think that's the most plausible interpretation. So, to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, considering only the constant term in \\(c\\), the coefficient is 120.\n\nWait, let me confirm that. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\) with coefficient 6. The term that gives \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, which happens when \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), so \\(k = 3\\), and the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, the combined coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, considering only the constant term in \\(c\\), is 120.\n\nWait, but the problem didn't specify anything about \\(c\\), so maybe it's just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), which would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but that would make the coefficient a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient.\n\nTherefore, I think the correct interpretation is that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nSo, to summarize:\n\n1. Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is 6.\n2. Expand \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\), which is 20.\n3. Multiply these two coefficients together to get 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, considering only the constant term in \\(c\\), is 120.\n\nI think that's the correct approach.

That means the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression will just be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but since we're only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is independent of \\(c\\), maybe I don't need to consider the \\(c\\) terms at all?\n\nWait, no, that doesn't sound right. Because when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the entire second part, plus any other terms that could contribute to \\(a^2b^2\\) when multiplied by terms from the second part. But since the second part is in terms of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), and \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't have any \\(c\\) terms, the only way \\(a^2b^2\\) can appear in the product is by multiplying the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part with the constant term (the term with \\(c^0\\)) from the second part.\n\nWait, that makes sense. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is equal to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nAlright, let's work on that. Using the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k\\). Simplifying the exponents, that becomes \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k - k} = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\).\n\nWe need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0 because that's the constant term. So, set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20.\n\nNow, putting it all together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the two coefficients we found. That is, 6 (from \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\)) multiplied by 20 (the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)). So, 6 times 20 is 120.\n\nWait, let me double-check that. So, the first part gives me 6, the second part gives me 20, and when I multiply them, it's 120. That seems right. But just to make sure I didn't make a mistake in my reasoning. So, the key idea is that when you have a product of two expressions, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each expression that multiply together to give that specific term. In this case, since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is by taking the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part and the constant term from the second part. So, yes, that makes sense.\n\nAlternatively, if I were to think about expanding the entire product, I would have terms like \\(a^2b^2 \\times c^k \\times (1/c)^m\\), but since \\(a^2b^2\\) is independent of \\(c\\), the only term that contributes to \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) factors is when \\(k = m\\), which gives the constant term. So, that again leads me to the same conclusion.\n\nI think that's solid. So, the coefficient is 120. Let me just write that down.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem for both parts of the expression.\n\nFirst, consider the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\). Using the binomial theorem, we have:\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n\\]\nWe need the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2. This occurs when \\(k = 2\\), so the coefficient is:\n\\[\n\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\n\\]\n\nNext, consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem, we have:\n\\[\n\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n\\]\nWe need the constant term, which occurs when the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0. This happens when \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), so \\(k = 3\\). The coefficient is:\n\\[\n\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\n\\]\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficients from the two parts:\n\\[\n6 \\times 20 = 120\n\\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}."

The expansion would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{0}a^4 + \\dbinom{4}{1}a^3b + \\dbinom{4}{2}a^2b^2 + \\dbinom{4}{3}ab^3 + \\dbinom{4}{4}b^4\\). Calculating the coefficients, that's \\(1a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + 1b^4\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) here is 6. But wait, that's just the first part of the original expression. The whole expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), so I can't stop here.\n\nNow, I need to consider the entire expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, maybe I can think about how multiplying by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) affects the terms in \\((a + b)^4\\). Since I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), that term comes from the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\), which is \\(6a^2b^2\\), and then multiplied by whatever comes from the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nWait, but actually, when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by every term in the second expansion. But since the second expansion is in terms of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), and I'm only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I don't need to worry about the \\(c\\) terms, right? Because \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\). So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't make sense because the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) would introduce terms with \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), which aren't present in \\(a^2b^2\\). So, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). That is, in the entire expansion, I need to find all the terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) appears, and sum their coefficients. So, the coefficient would be \\(6\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that's not correct either because each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) has different powers of \\(c\\), so when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), each term would be \\(6 \\times \\text{coefficient from the second expansion} \\times a^2b^2 c^k\\) or something like that. But the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not considering \\(c\\). So, does that mean I can treat the two parts separately?\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again. The expression is a product of two polynomials: one in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the other in \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). Since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are different variables, the terms in the product will have terms like \\(a^kb^m c^n\\) or \\(a^kb^m c^{-n}\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would only come from the product of the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first polynomial and the constant term (i.e., the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero) in the second polynomial. Because if I multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by any term with \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), it would result in a term like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), which isn't just \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nSo, now I need to find two things:\n\n1. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which I already found as 6.\n\n2. The coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nLet me work on the second part. The expression \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) can also be expanded using the binomial theorem. The general term in the expansion is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be zero, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\).\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\).\n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20.\n\nNow, going back to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficients from the two parts, which is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nWait, but let me double-check to make sure I didn't make a mistake. So, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6, because \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). And in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero occurs when \\(k = 3\\), and the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, multiplying 6 and 20 gives 120. That seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, another way to think about it is that when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each polynomial. Since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), it's only affected by the constant term in the second polynomial. So, yeah, I think 120 is the right answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem for both parts of the expression.\n\nFirst, we expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n\\]\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in this expansion is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n\nNext, we consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem:\n\\[\n\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n\\]\nWe need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, which occurs when \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(k = 3\\). The coefficient of this term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficients from the two parts:\n\\[\n6 \\times 20 = 120\n\\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}."

Wait, is that correct?\n\nWait, no. Let me clarify. When you have two polynomials multiplied together, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum of the products of the coefficients of terms whose variables multiply to give that specific term. In this case, we're looking for \\(a^2b^2\\). Since the second polynomial only has terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), which are different variables, the variables \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) don't interact with \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). Therefore, when multiplying, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will be multiplied by every term in the second polynomial. However, since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, perhaps we can think of it as the coefficient in the first part times the sum of all coefficients in the second part.\n\nWait, but actually, that's not quite right. Let me think again. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first polynomial, and when you multiply it by each term in the second polynomial, each of those will contribute to the overall coefficient. But since the question is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and the second polynomial is multiplied by it, the coefficient will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial multiplied by the entire second polynomial. But that can't be, because then it would be a polynomial in \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this.\n\nWait, actually, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, which includes both parts. So, if I consider the entire product, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part will be multiplied by every term in the second part. But since the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, perhaps we can treat the second polynomial as a scalar when considering the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nWait, that makes sense because when you multiply a term by a polynomial, the coefficient of that term in the product is the original coefficient multiplied by the sum of the coefficients of the polynomial.

The sum of the coefficients in a polynomial is found by setting all variables to 1.

Alternatively, if I were to expand both polynomials completely and multiply them, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would appear multiplied by each term from the second polynomial, but since the question only asks for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, the coefficient would be 6 times 64, which is 384.\n\nI think that makes sense.

Multiplying these together gives \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{384}\n\\]"

Using the binomial theorem, this should expand to the sum from \\(k = 0\\) to \\(4\\) of \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\\). I need the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which means I need the term where \\(a\\) is squared and \\(b\\) is squared.

But that would mean the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all terms in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which can't be right because then it would be a polynomial in \\(c\\), not a single coefficient.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)\". So, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of the term that has \\(a^2b^2\\) times any combination of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\).

So, first, find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, as I found earlier. Then, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).

Therefore, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\), which is \\(\\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\).\n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire expression is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nWait, but let me double-check that. So, the first part gives 6 for \\(a^2b^2\\), and the second part gives 20 for \\(c^0\\), so multiplying them gives 120. That seems right.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm supposed to consider all possible terms, but I think that's not necessary because the variables are independent. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but since the problem is asking for the coefficient, and not the entire expression, it's more likely that they want the coefficient when considering all terms, but that doesn't make sense because the variables are separate.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is actually written correctly, and I just need to consider the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. But that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial in \\(c\\), so the coefficient isn't a single number. Therefore, maybe the problem is intended to have the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), which is 120, as I found earlier.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating \\(c\\) as a variable, but then the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\). But that seems unlikely because the problem is asking for a coefficient, which is usually a number. Therefore, I think the intended interpretation is that we need the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nSo, to summarize: The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Multiplying these together gives 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in calculating the binomial coefficients. For \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). For \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term with \\(c^0\\) is when \\(m = 3\\), so \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, 6 times 20 is 120. That seems correct.\n\nI think that's the answer. So, the coefficient is 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem.\n\nFirst, consider the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n\\]\nWe need the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which occurs when \\(k = 2\\). This coefficient is:\n\\[\n\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\n\\]\n\nNext, consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem:\n\\[\n\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n\\]\nWe need the coefficient of \\(c^0\\), which occurs when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(m = 3\\). This coefficient is:\n\\[\n\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\n\\]\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficients found above:\n\\[\n6 \\times 20 = 120\n\\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}."

    "text": " So maybe I can apply that here.\n\nAlright, looking at the first part of the expression, \\((a + b)^4\\). I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Using the binomial theorem, the general term in the expansion is \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}a^{4 - k}b^k\\). I need the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2. So, that would be when \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). Let me compute that coefficient.\n\nCalculating \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\), which is \\(\\dfrac{4!}{2!2!}\\). That's \\(\\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6.\n\nWait, but the expression isn't just \\((a + b)^4\\); it's multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Hmm, does that affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)? Let me think. Since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\) and \\(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\), when we multiply the two expansions together, the coefficients for terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) won't be affected by the terms involving \\(c\\). So, does that mean the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just the same as the coefficient in \\((a + b)^4\\)?\n\nWait, but hold on a second. Let me make sure I'm not missing something. The entire expression is the product of two expansions: one in terms of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and another in terms of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). When you multiply two polynomials together, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. However, since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\), and \\(1/c\\) are all different variables, the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) won't interact with those involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will indeed just be the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part, but wait, no, that's not quite right.\n\nWait, actually, no. Let me clarify. If I have two expressions, say \\(P(a, b)\\) and \\(Q(c)\\), then the product \\(P(a, b) \\times Q(c)\\) will have terms where each term in \\(P(a, b)\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(Q(c)\\). So, for example, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(P(a, b)\\) will be multiplied by every term in \\(Q(c)\\), which is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 multiplied by the sum of the coefficients of all terms in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nWait, but that doesn't seem right. Because if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\), then I don't need to consider the terms in \\(c\\); I just need to know that each term in \\(P(a, b)\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(Q(c)\\), but since I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), it would actually be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(Q(c)\\).\n\nBut wait, that seems a bit confusing. Let me think again. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product comes from multiplying \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part by each term in the second part. But \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), so it's just \\(a^2b^2\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, the sum of all coefficients in a polynomial is found by plugging in 1 for all variables. So, if I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) becomes \\((1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of all coefficients is 64.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 * 64 = 384. But wait, that seems high. Let me check if that's correct.\n\nWait, no, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me clarify. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is actually just the coefficient from the first part because the second part doesn't affect the variables \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). So, when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, it's just \\(a^2b^2\\) times something, so the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. But that seems too large, and I'm not sure if that's correct.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me approach it differently. The expression is \\((a + b)^4\\) times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). When you multiply these two, each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) has a coefficient of 6, and when you multiply it by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), you're effectively scaling that 6 by each coefficient in the second expansion. But since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is indeed 64, so 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nBut wait, that feels off because the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not considering any terms with \\(c\\). So, maybe the correct approach is that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is just the coefficient from the first part, because the second part's expansion doesn't affect \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). But that can't be right because when you multiply, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second, so the coefficient would be the product of the coefficients. Wait, but \\(a^2b^2\\) is only present in the first part, so when you multiply by the second part, you're effectively scaling that coefficient by the entire second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me check that again. Let me think of it as two separate expansions. The first expansion is \\((a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). The second expansion is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). When I multiply these two, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, resulting in \\(6a^2b^2 \\times \\left(c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15/c^2 + 6/c^4 + 1/c^6\\right)\\). So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times each of the coefficients in the second expansion, but since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), it's actually 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. The sum of coefficients in the second expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\(2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but that seems too large. Let me confirm by considering a simpler case. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, expanding, \\((a^2 + 2ab + b^2) \\times (c + 1/c)\\). The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 1 (from \\(a^2\\)) times 1 (from \\(c\\)) plus 1 (from \\(1/c\\)), so 1*(1 + 1) = 2. Similarly, the coefficient of \\(ab\\) would be 2 times (1 + 1) = 4. So, in this case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 1 * 2 = 2, which is the same as the sum of coefficients in the second expansion (2) times the coefficient in the first expansion (1). So, in our original problem, it's 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think of it as two independent expansions. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and since the second expansion doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is just 6 times the entire second expansion, but that doesn't make sense because the second expansion is in terms of \\(c\\), not \\(a\\) or \\(b\\). So, perhaps the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is just 6, because when you multiply by the second expansion, you're not changing the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\); you're just adding more terms with \\(c\\). Wait, that makes more sense.\n\nWait, so perhaps I was wrong earlier. Let me think: when you multiply two expressions, the coefficients of the variables in one don't affect the coefficients of the variables in the other. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will have the same coefficient as in the first expansion, which is 6, and then multiplied by each term in the second expansion, but since \\(a^2b^2\\) is separate from \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is just 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion. But that would mean 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but in my simpler example, I saw that the coefficient was 2, which was 1 (from the first expansion) times 2 (sum of coefficients in the second expansion). So, that seems to align. Therefore, in the original problem, it should be 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, so it's just 6. But that doesn't seem right because when you multiply by the second expansion, you're effectively scaling each term by all the terms in the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be present in the product as \\(6a^2b^2 \\times \\left(c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15/c^2 + 6/c^4 + 1/c^6\\right)\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 multiplied by each coefficient in the second expansion, but since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms, we need to consider only the constant term in the second expansion.\n\nWait, that makes more sense. Because \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term without \\(c\\), so to get \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, we need to multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion by the constant term (the term with \\(c^0\\)) in the second expansion. So, the coefficient would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\).\n\nAh, that's a better approach. So, first, find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6. Then, find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is the constant term. Then, multiply those two coefficients together to get the final coefficient in the product.\n\nOkay, so let me compute the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem, the general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - k} \\left(1/c\\right)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\\). We need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be 0, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\).\n\nTherefore, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, that makes more sense. So, I think I made a mistake earlier by considering the sum of all coefficients instead of just the constant term. Because when looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), we only need to consider the term in the second expansion that doesn't involve \\(c\\), which is the constant term. So, the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nLet me verify this with a smaller example to make sure. Let's take \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). The expansion of \\((a + b)^2\\) is \\(a^2 + 2ab + b^2\\). The expansion of \\((c + 1/c)^1\\) is \\(c + 1/c\\). Now, the product is \\((a^2 + 2ab + b^2)(c + 1/c)\\). The term \\(a^2b^2\\) isn't present because in the first expansion, the highest power is \\(a^2b^0\\) and \\(ab^1\\), etc. Wait, actually, in \\((a + b)^2\\), the term \\(a^2\\) is \\(a^2\\), \\(2ab\\), and \\(b^2\\). So, when multiplied by \\(c + 1/c\\), the term \\(a^2\\) becomes \\(a^2c + a^2/c\\), the term \\(2ab\\) becomes \\(2abc + 2ab/c\\), and the term \\(b^2\\) becomes \\(b^2c + b^2/c\\). So, there is no \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the product, which makes sense because the original expression doesn't have a \\(b^2\\) term multiplied by another \\(b^2\\) term. Wait, but in our original problem, we have \\((a + b)^4\\), which does have a \\(a^2b^2\\) term. So, in the product, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, but since we're only interested in the \\(a^2b^2\\) term without any \\(c\\) terms, we only consider the constant term in the second expansion.\n\nSo, in the smaller example, if I take \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^2\\), then the expansion of \\((c + 1/c)^2\\) is \\(c^2 + 2 + 1/c^2\\). The constant term is 2. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^2\\) is 1 (from \\(2ab\\), wait no, \\((a + b)^2\\) is \\(a^2 + 2ab + b^2\\), so there's no \\(a^2b^2\\) term. Wait, so maybe that's not a good example. Let me try with \\((a + b)^3\\). The expansion is \\(a^3 + 3a^2b + 3ab^2 + b^3\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b\\) is 3. If I multiply by \\((c + 1/c)^1\\), which is \\(c + 1/c\\), then the coefficient of \\(a^2b\\) in the product would be 3 times the sum of coefficients in the second expansion, but that's not the case. Actually, when you multiply \\(a^2b\\) by \\(c + 1/c\\), you get \\(a^2bc + a^2b/c\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b\\) without any \\(c\\) terms is zero because there's no constant term for \\(a^2b\\). Wait, but that's not right because the constant term in the second expansion is 0 in this case, but that's not the case for \\((c + 1/c)^6\\).\n\nWait, perhaps my confusion arises from mixing up the terms. Let me go back to the original problem. The key is that when you have two separate variables, the coefficients in one part don't affect the coefficients in the other part. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the product of the coefficients of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part.\n\nSo, in the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. In the second part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So, the final answer is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and the constant term in the second part, then multiplying them together.\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term with \\(a^2b^2\\) occurs when \\(k = 2\\), giving the coefficient:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\n   \\]\n\n2. **Find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   Using the binomial theorem:\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n   \\]\n   The constant term occurs when \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), so \\(k = 3\\), giving the coefficient:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\n   \\]\n\n3. **Multiply the coefficients:**\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 20 = 120\n   \\]\n\n**Final Answer:** The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

Let me read the problem again.\n\nThe problem says: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression. Since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by every term in the \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) expansion. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nBut wait, the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by substituting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, the coefficient would be 6 * 64 = 384. But I'm not sure if that's the intended interpretation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some specific \\(k\\), but since it's not specified, I think the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). That is, the coefficient would be the sum of all terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any power of \\(c\\). Therefore, it's 6 times the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion, which is 64, giving 384.\n\nBut wait, let me check another approach. Let me expand both parts separately and then multiply the terms.\n\nFirst, \\((a + b)^4\\) has the term \\(a^2b^2\\) with coefficient 6.\n\nThen, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) can be expanded using the binomial theorem as \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\).\n\nSo, each term in the second expansion is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\) for \\(k = 0\\) to \\(6\\).\n\nNow, when we multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, which is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\).\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be 6 times the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion. Because each term in the second expansion has a coefficient, and when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), it contributes to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product.\n\nBut wait, the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion is indeed when \\(c = 1\\), which is \\(2^6 = 64\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me think again. If I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then yes, it's 6 times the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion. So, 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem was asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for a specific \\(k\\), then it would be different. But since it's just \\(a^2b^2\\), without any restriction on \\(c\\), the coefficient would indeed be 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me make sure. Suppose I have two polynomials, P(a, b) and Q(c). When you multiply them, each term in P is multiplied by each term in Q. So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), it would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in P(a, b) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in Q(c). Because when you multiply, each term in P is multiplied by each term in Q, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in P times the sum of coefficients in Q.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So, since the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in P is 6, and the sum of coefficients in Q is 64, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me think of a simpler example to verify. Suppose P = (a + b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2, and Q = (c + 1/c)^1 = c + 1/c. Then, the product is (a^2 + 2ab + b^2)(c + 1/c) = a^2c + a^2/c + 2abc + 2ab/c + b^2c + b^2/c.\n\nNow, if I look for the coefficient of \\(a^2\\), it would be the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) in P times the sum of coefficients in Q. The coefficient of \\(a^2\\) in P is 1, and the sum of coefficients in Q is 2 (since when c=1, Q=2). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) in the product should be 1*2=2. Looking at the expanded product, the terms with \\(a^2\\) are \\(a^2c\\) and \\(a^2/c\\), each with coefficient 1. So, the total coefficient is 1 + 1 = 2, which matches 1*2=2.\n\nSimilarly, if I take another example where Q has more terms, like Q = (c + 1/c)^2 = c^2 + 2 + 1/c^2. The sum of coefficients is (1 + 1)^2 = 4. So, if P is (a + b)^2, then the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) in P is 1, and the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) in the product would be 1*4=4. Expanding, P*Q = (a^2 + 2ab + b^2)(c^2 + 2 + 1/c^2) = a^2c^2 + 2a^2 + a^2/c^2 + 2abc^2 + 4ab + 2ab/c^2 + b^2c^2 + 2b^2 + b^2/c^2. The terms with \\(a^2\\) are 2a^2, a^2c^2, and a^2/c^2, each with coefficients 2,1,1. So, total coefficient is 2 + 1 + 1 = 4, which is indeed 1*4=4.\n\nSo, this approach seems correct. Therefore, in the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me check another way. Suppose I consider the entire expansion:\n\n\\((a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\).\n\n\\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\).\n\nSo, when I multiply these, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion.\n\nBut the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion is when \\(c = 1\\), which is \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem had asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for a specific \\(k\\), then I would have to find the corresponding term in the second expansion and multiply by 6. But since it's just \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\), the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 384.\n\nI think that's the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n\\boxed{384}"

    "text": " So maybe I can apply that here.\n\nIn this case, the first part is \\((a + b)^4\\). Let me expand that. Using the binomial theorem, the expansion will have terms from \\(a^4\\) down to \\(b^4\\), each multiplied by a binomial coefficient. The general term is \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}a^{4 - k}b^k\\) where \\(k\\) goes from 0 to 4.\n\nNow, I specifically need the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, I should find the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2. That would correspond to \\(k = 2\\) in the binomial expansion. Let me compute that coefficient: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). I remember that \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\nBut wait, the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I need to consider the entire product. Now, the thing is, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), so when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). However, since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient will just be 6 multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nWait, no, that's not quite right. Because when you multiply by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in that expansion is a coefficient times some power of \\(c\\). But since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and that term doesn't have any \\(c\\) in it, we're effectively looking for the term where the power of \\(c\\) is zero, because otherwise, the term would have \\(c\\) raised to some power, and that would make it a different term when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\).\n\nSo, perhaps I need to find the term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) that has \\(c^0\\), because only that term will, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), result in a term that's just \\(a^2b^2\\). The other terms would have \\(c\\) raised to some power, so they would contribute to terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or similar, but we're only interested in \\(a^2b^2\\) itself, so the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is what I need.\n\nSo, let's find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Again, I can use the binomial theorem here. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying each term, that becomes \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\).\n\nWe need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be zero, so we set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(6 = 2m\\) so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the term where \\(m = 3\\) is the one with \\(c^0\\). The coefficient for this term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\).\n\nCalculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). Wait, actually, let me check that calculation again. \\(6! = 720\\), \\(3! = 6\\), so \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). Yeah, that's correct.\n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Therefore, when I multiply the two expansions together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) will be the product of the coefficients from each part. That is, 6 (from \\((a + b)^4\\)) multiplied by 20 (from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)), which gives 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6a^2b^2, and the term \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 20. So, when you multiply these together, you get 6 * 20 * a^2b^2 * c^0, which is 120a^2b^2. So, the coefficient is indeed 120.\n\nAlternatively, another way to think about it is that the entire expression is a product of two independent expansions. So, any term in the product will be a term from the first expansion multiplied by a term from the second expansion. Since we're looking for the term where the variables a and b are squared, and the variables c and 1/c are raised to zero, we only need to consider the specific terms from each expansion that contribute to those exponents.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient is the product of the individual coefficients, which is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nI think that makes sense. Let me just double-check my calculations. For the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). For the second part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term where the exponent of c is zero occurs at \\(m = 3\\), and \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem.\n\nFirst, consider the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\). Using the binomial theorem, the term with \\(a^2b^2\\) is given by:\n\\[\n\\binom{4}{2} a^2 b^2 = 6a^2b^2\n\\]\nSo, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\nNext, consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. Using the binomial theorem, the general term is:\n\\[\n\\binom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n\\]\nSetting the exponent equal to zero, we solve for \\(m\\):\n\\[\n6 - 2m = 0 \\implies m = 3\n\\]\nThe coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is:\n\\[\n\\binom{6}{3} = 20\n\\]\n\nMultiplying the coefficients from each expansion, we get:\n\\[\n6 \\times 20 = 120\n\\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

Because when you multiply two expressions, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), that term would come from taking the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in \\((a + b)^4\\) and multiplying it by every term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would actually be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the sum of all coefficients in the second part. But wait, that can't be right because each term in the second expansion has different powers of \\(c\\), so when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), they would create terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2c^{-k}\\), which are different from \\(a^2b^2\\). \n\nWait, so maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). That is, in the entire product, how many times does \\(a^2b^2\\) appear, multiplied by any combination of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\).

Because the problem might just be asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, in other words, it's the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nWait, but the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) can be found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of the coefficients is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nBut wait, let me double-check that. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\), then yes, it's just the coefficient from the first part times the sum of coefficients from the second part. So, 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nAlternatively, if the problem was asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some specific \\(k\\), then we would need to compute it differently, but since it's just \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\), then 384 is the answer. \n\nWait, but let me think again. When you multiply two expressions, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part, each of which has different powers of \\(c\\). So, in the product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, which means that in the product, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is actually the sum of all the coefficients in the second expansion multiplied by 6. \n\nSo, the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is indeed found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\(2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nWait, but let me confirm this approach. Alternatively, maybe I should consider that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, which would be the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because each term in the second expansion is a coefficient times some power of \\(c\\), and when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), they contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. \n\nYes, that makes sense. So, the coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. Another way to think about it is that when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in one polynomial is multiplied by the entire other polynomial. So, in this case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and when you multiply it by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nAlternatively, if the problem had asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\) (i.e., the constant term), then we would need to compute it differently. In that case, we would need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\), and then multiply that by 6, giving 120. But since the problem just asks for \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, it's 384. \n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused now. Let me check with a smaller example to make sure. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, expanding, it's \\((a^2 + 2ab + b^2) \\times (c + 1/c)\\). The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be zero because there's no \\(a^2b^2\\) term. Wait, but that's a bad example because \\((a + b)^2\\) doesn't have \\(a^2b^2\\). Let me take \\((a + b)^3\\), which has \\(a^3 + 3a^2b + 3ab^2 + b^3\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b\\) is 3. Now, if I multiply by \\((c + 1/c)^1 = c + 1/c, then the coefficient of \\(a^2b\\) in the product would be 3*(1 + 1) = 6, because each term in \\((a + b)^3\\) is multiplied by each term in \\((c + 1/c)\\). But in reality, when you multiply, the coefficient of \\(a^2b\\) would be 3*(1 + 1) = 6, because each term in \\((a + b)^3\\) is multiplied by both \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b\\) in the product is indeed 6, which is 3 times the sum of the coefficients in \\((c + 1/c)\\), which is 2. \n\nSo, applying that logic to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 64, so the coefficient in the product is 6*64=384. \n\nWait, but let me check another example to be sure. Let's take \\((a + b)^1 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). The coefficient of \\(ab\\) would be zero because \\((a + b)^1\\) only has \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), no \\(ab\\). Wait, but that's not helpful. Let me take \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). The coefficient of \\(ab\\) in \\((a + b)^2\\) is 2, and the sum of coefficients in \\((c + 1/c)\\) is 2, so the coefficient of \\(ab\\) in the product would be 2*2=4. Let's see: \\((a^2 + 2ab + b^2)(c + 1/c)\\). The \\(ab\\) term is 2ab*c + 2ab*(1/c), which is 2abc + 2ab/c. So, the coefficient of \\(ab\\) is 2*(1 + 1) = 4, which matches. So, that seems correct. \n\nTherefore, applying the same logic, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nWait, but just to be absolutely sure, let me compute the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). The sum of coefficients is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, that's correct. \n\nAlternatively, if I didn't set \\(c = 1\\), I could expand \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem: \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\times (1/c)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). The sum of the coefficients is when \\(c = 1\\), so it's \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} = 2^6 = 64\\). \n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is indeed 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nWait, but let me think again. Is there another way to approach this problem? For example, maybe the problem is intended to be interpreted differently. Perhaps it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where the exponents of \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are 2, 2, and 0 respectively. If that's the case, then the approach would be different. \n\nIn that case, we would need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product. That would involve taking the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) from \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and multiplying it by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). \n\nThe coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is the middle term when the exponent is zero. Using the binomial theorem, the term where \\(c^{6 - 2k} = c^0\\) is when \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), so \\(k = 3\\). The coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). \n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) would be 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nBut wait, the problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", not \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). So, it's ambiguous whether it's asking for \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms or specifically \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). \n\nGiven that the problem includes \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) in the second part, it's possible that it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). Because if it's just asking for \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\), then the coefficient would be 6 * 64 = 384, as I thought earlier. \n\nBut perhaps the problem is intended to ask for \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). Let me check the problem statement again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" It doesn't specify anything about \\(c\\), so it's more likely that it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. Therefore, the answer would be 384. \n\nHowever, to be thorough, I should consider both interpretations. \n\nIf it's asking for \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), then the answer is 384. \n\nIf it's asking for \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), the answer is 120. \n\nBut given the way the problem is phrased, I think the first interpretation is correct. \n\nWait, but let me think again. When you have a product of two expressions, the terms in the product are combinations of terms from each expression. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by each term from the second part, which includes various powers of \\(c\\). So, in the product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is present multiplied by \\(c^k\\) and \\(c^{-k}\\) for different \\(k\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the sum of all the coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by 6. \n\nTherefore, the coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nWait, but to make sure, let me consider the entire expansion. \n\nThe expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is \\(a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). \n\nThe expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\times (1/c)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). \n\nSo, when you multiply these two, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, which are \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\) for \\(k = 0\\) to \\(6\\). \n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is \\(6 \\times \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k}\\). But \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} = 2^6 = 64\\). \n\nSo, the coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nTherefore, the final answer is 384.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can proceed as follows:\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term containing \\(a^2b^2\\) occurs when \\(k = 2\\):\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} a^{2}b^{2} = 6a^2b^2\n   \\]\n   So, the coefficient is 6.\n\n2. **Consider the second part \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   The sum of the coefficients in this expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\):\n   \\[\n   \\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\n   \\]\n\n3. **Multiply the coefficients:**\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of the coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 64 = 384\n   \\]\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{384}\\)."

Let me write out the expansion:\n\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\dbinom{4}{0}a^4b^0 + \\dbinom{4}{1}a^3b^1 + \\dbinom{4}{2}a^2b^2 + \\dbinom{4}{3}a^1b^3 + \\dbinom{4}{4}a^0b^4\n\\]\n\nCalculating the binomial coefficients:\n\n- \\(\\dbinom{4}{0} = 1\\)\n- \\(\\dbinom{4}{1} = 4\\)\n- \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\)\n- \\(\\dbinom{4}{3} = 4\\)\n- \\(\\dbinom{4}{4} = 1\\)\n\nSo, the expansion becomes:\n\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\n\\]\n\nOkay, so in this expansion, the term with \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(6a^2b^2\\), so the coefficient is 6. But wait, the problem is asking for the coefficient in the entire expression, which is \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I can't stop here; I need to consider the other part as well.\n\nSo, the entire expression is the product of two expansions: one in terms of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the other in terms of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). Let me denote them as \\(E = (a + b)^4\\) and \\(F = \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the entire expression is \\(E \\times F\\).\n\nNow, when I multiply two polynomials, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. So, each term in \\(E\\) will be multiplied by each term in \\(F\\). But the question is specifically about the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, in the product \\(E \\times F\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will only come from multiplying the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in \\(E\\) by every term in \\(F\\), right? Because any other term in \\(E\\) would have a different power of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), so when multiplied by terms in \\(F\\), they won't result in \\(a^2b^2\\).\n\nWait, let me think again. If I take a term from \\(E\\) that has \\(a^kb^m\\), and multiply it by a term from \\(F\\) that has \\(c^n\\), then the resulting term will be \\(a^kb^m c^n\\). Since the original problem is only asking about the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I need to find all terms in the product where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2 each. So, that would only come from the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) in \\(E\\) multiplied by every term in \\(F\\). Because any other term in \\(E\\) would have a different power of \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), so when multiplied by terms in \\(F\\), they won't contribute to \\(a^2b^2\\).\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(E\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(F\\). Because when you multiply \\(6a^2b^2\\) by each term in \\(F\\), you get terms like \\(6a^2b^2c^n\\), but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), we need to sum all the coefficients from \\(F\\) and multiply by 6.\n\nWait, is that correct? Let me make sure. If I have \\(6a^2b^2\\) multiplied by each term in \\(F\\), which is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), then each term in \\(F\\) is of the form \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - k}(1/c)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, each term in \\(F\\) is a coefficient times a power of \\(c\\). So, when I multiply \\(6a^2b^2\\) by each term in \\(F\\), I get terms like \\(6 \\times \\dbinom{6}{k} a^2b^2 c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, each of these terms has \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by a different power of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the sum of all the coefficients from \\(F\\), because each term in \\(F\\) contributes a multiple of \\(a^2b^2\\) times a different power of \\(c\\), but the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just the sum of all those multiples.\n\nSo, to find the coefficient, I need to compute the sum of the coefficients in \\(F\\). The sum of the coefficients in any polynomial is found by plugging in 1 for all variables. So, if I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(F\\) becomes \\((1 + 1/1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the sum of the coefficients in \\(F\\) is 64.\n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\nWait, hold on, that seems too straightforward. Let me verify. Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that in the product \\(E \\times F\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) can come from different combinations of terms in \\(E\\) and \\(F\\). But no, because in \\(E\\), only the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will, when multiplied by any term in \\(F\\), give a term with \\(a^2b^2\\). All other terms in \\(E\\) have different powers of \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), so when multiplied by terms in \\(F\\), they won't contribute to the \\(a^2b^2\\) term.\n\nWait, but actually, no, because \\(F\\) is a separate polynomial in \\(c\\), so when you multiply \\(E\\) and \\(F\\), the variables \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are independent. Therefore, the only way to get a term with \\(a^2b^2\\) is to take the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from \\(E\\) and multiply it by any term from \\(F\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is indeed the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(E\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(F\\). So, that would be \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\nBut let me think again. Alternatively, perhaps I can consider that each term in the product is formed by choosing either \\(a\\) or \\(b\\) from each of the four factors in \\((a + b)^4\\) and either \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\) from each of the six factors in \\((c + 1/c)^6\\). But in this case, we are specifically looking for terms where exactly two \\(a\\)s and two \\(b\\)s are chosen from the four factors, and any combination of \\(c\\)s and \\(1/c\\)s from the six factors. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), we can think of it as the product of the number of ways to choose \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and the total number of ways in the second part.\n\nWait, so the number of ways to choose \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\), as we saw earlier. Then, the number of ways to choose any combination in \\((c + 1/c)^6\\) is \\(2^6 = 64\\), because each term is a choice between two options. Therefore, the total number of terms contributing to \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). So, the coefficient is 384.\n\nWait, but let me check this with an example. Let's consider a simpler case. Suppose we have \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). The expansion of \\((a + b)^2\\) is \\(a^2 + 2ab + b^2\\). The expansion of \\((c + 1/c)^1\\) is \\(c + 1/c\\). Now, the product would be:\n\n\\[\n(a^2 + 2ab + b^2)(c + 1/c) = a^2c + a^2/c + 2abc + 2ab/c + b^2c + b^2/c\n\\]\n\nNow, if I look for the coefficient of \\(a^2\\), which in this case is the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) in the product. But in this product, the terms with \\(a^2\\) are \\(a^2c\\) and \\(a^2/c\\), each with coefficient 1. So, the total coefficient of \\(a^2\\) is 1 + 1 = 2, which is indeed the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) in the first polynomial times the sum of coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 2.\n\nSimilarly, in our original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient in the first polynomial times the sum of coefficients in the second polynomial. So, 6 times 64 is 384. That seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can think of it as the multinomial expansion. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times (c + 1/c)^6\\). The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from choosing 2 \\(a\\)s and 2 \\(b\\)s in the first part, and any combination in the second part. The number of ways to choose 2 \\(a\\)s from 4 is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\), and the number of ways to choose any combination in the second part is \\(2^6 = 64\\), so the total number of terms contributing to \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but actually, in the second part, each term is not just a choice between two options; each term is a product of six factors, each being either \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\). So, the expansion of \\((c + 1/c)^6\\) will have terms of the form \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - k}(1/c)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\\), where \\(k\\) ranges from 0 to 6. So, each term has a coefficient \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}\\) and a power of \\(c^{6 - 2k}\\).\n\nBut when we multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), each term in the product will be \\(6 \\times \\dbinom{6}{k} a^2b^2 c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the sum over all \\(k\\) of \\(6 \\times \\dbinom{6}{k}\\). But the sum of \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}\\) from \\(k=0\\) to \\(6\\) is \\(2^6 = 64\\), so the total coefficient is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\nYes, that seems consistent. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 384.\n\nWait, but let me check if I'm not missing something. Is there a possibility that other terms in \\(E\\) could contribute to \\(a^2b^2\\) when multiplied by terms in \\(F\\)? For example, if I take a term with \\(a^3b\\) from \\(E\\) and multiply it by a term with \\(1/c\\) from \\(F\\), would that somehow result in \\(a^2b^2\\)? But no, because when you multiply \\(a^3b\\) by \\(1/c\\), you get \\(a^3b/c\\), which still has \\(a^3b\\), not \\(a^2b^2\\). Similarly, any other term from \\(E\\) would have a different power of \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), so when multiplied by any term from \\(F\\), which only affects the power of \\(c\\), the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) remain the same. Therefore, only the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in \\(E\\) contributes to the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the product.\n\nTherefore, I can confidently say that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 384.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{384}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem for both parts of the expression.\n\nFirst, we expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\dbinom{4}{0}a^4 + \\dbinom{4}{1}a^3b + \\dbinom{4}{2}a^2b^2 + \\dbinom{4}{3}ab^3 + \\dbinom{4}{4}b^4\n\\]\nCalculating the binomial coefficients, we get:\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\n\\]\nThe term with \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(6a^2b^2\\), so the coefficient is 6.\n\nNext, we consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The sum of the coefficients in this expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\):\n\\[\n\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\n\\]\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient is:\n\\[\n6 \\times 64 = 384\n\\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{384}\\)."

So the coefficient here is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\).\n\nCalculating that, \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So the coefficient from the first part is 6.\n\nNow, the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Hmm, so I guess I need to consider how this multiplication affects the coefficient I just found. Wait, but actually, since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which only involves \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), maybe the terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) don't affect this coefficient? Or do they?\n\nWait, no, actually, I think I'm misunderstanding. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So when we expand this, each term from the first expansion is multiplied by each term from the second expansion. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), that term must come from the product of the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part and the constant term (i.e., the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero) from the second part.\n\nWait, is that right? Let me think again. So, if I have \\((a + b)^4\\) which gives me terms like \\(a^4\\), \\(4a^3b\\), \\(6a^2b^2\\), \\(4ab^3\\), \\(b^4\\), and then \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) which gives terms involving various powers of \\(c\\). When I multiply them together, each term from the first expansion is multiplied by each term from the second. So, for example, \\(6a^2b^2\\) from the first part would be multiplied by each term from the second part, like \\(c^6\\), \\(6c^4\\), \\(15c^2\\), \\(20\\), \\(15/c^2\\), \\(6/c^4\\), and \\(1/c^6\\).\n\nBut since we're only interested in the term \\(a^2b^2\\), we need to find all the terms in the product where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2 and 2 respectively, and the exponents of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) must cancel out to give a constant term because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is just a term with \\(a^2b^2\\) and no \\(c\\) terms. Therefore, the term we're looking for is \\(6a^2b^2\\) multiplied by the constant term from the second expansion, which is \\(20\\), because in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the constant term is when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero.\n\nWait, let me check that. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem is:\n\n\\[\n\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n\\]\n\nSo the exponent of \\(c\\) is \\(6 - 2m\\). We want the exponent to be zero, so:\n\n\\[\n6 - 2m = 0 \\implies m = 3\n\\]\n\nSo the constant term is when \\(m = 3\\), which gives \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = 20\\). So the constant term is 20.\n\nTherefore, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be \\(6a^2b^2 \\times 20\\), which gives \\(120a^2b^2\\). So the coefficient is 120.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't miss anything. Is there any other term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) that could contribute to the \\(a^2b^2\\) term? For example, if there were a term with \\(c^1\\) and another with \\(c^{-1}\\), their product would be \\(c^0\\), but in this case, the only term that contributes to \\(c^0\\) is the constant term, which is 20. So I don't think any other terms would contribute because the other terms would have positive or negative exponents of \\(c\\), and when multiplied by the \\(a^2b^2\\) term, they would result in terms with \\(c\\) exponents, which we don't want. So the only contribution is from the constant term.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the second part), which equals 120.\n\nWait, just to be thorough, let me write out the entire expansion steps again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nFirst, \\((a + b)^4\\) expanded is:\n\n\\[\na^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\n\\]\n\nAnd \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) expanded is:\n\n\\[\nc^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15/c^2 + 6/c^4 + 1/c^6\n\\]\n\nNow, when we multiply these two expansions together, each term from the first will multiply each term from the second. But since we're only interested in the terms where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2 and 2 respectively, and the exponents of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) cancel out, we only need to consider the \\(6a^2b^2\\) term from the first expansion and the \\(20\\) term from the second expansion.

I'm looking for the term where the exponents of both \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2 because the problem is asking for \\(a^2b^2\\). So, I need to find the value of \\(k\\) such that \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). Let me check: if \\(k = 2\\), then \\(4 - 2 = 2\\), so yes, that's the term I need.\n\nNow, the coefficient for this term is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Let me compute that: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\nWait, but the original expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I think I need to consider both parts together. However, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), so maybe the coefficient is just 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, no, because the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and since \\(a^2b^2\\) is part of the first part, and the second part is multiplied by it, but since \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) are separate variables, their terms won't affect the exponent of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). So, maybe the coefficient is just 6, regardless of the other part.\n\nWait, but let me think again. The entire expression is the product of two expansions: \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when you multiply them together, each term from the first expansion is multiplied by each term from the second expansion. However, since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), the other terms from the second expansion will just be multiplied by 1 (since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't have any \\(c\\) terms). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. But wait, that doesn't make sense because the second part is being multiplied by each term of the first part, so actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of all terms in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that can't be right because the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\). So, maybe I'm overcomplicating it.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, when they say the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), they're treating this as a term in the entire expansion, which includes both \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\), and \\(1/c\\). But \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), so in the entire expansion, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by the sum of all the terms in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\).\n\nWait, that can't be right because the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which would give \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, would the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) be 6 * 64 = 384? But that seems too high, and I'm not sure if that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm supposed to consider that \\(a^2b^2\\) is part of the first expansion, and the second expansion is just multiplied by it, so the coefficient would be 6 times the entire second expansion, but that doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a specific term, not a product of terms. I'm getting confused here.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Let me try to break it down. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when you multiply these two, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion will be multiplied by every term in the second expansion. But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), that means that the coefficient is \\(6 \\times\\) the sum of all the coefficients in the second expansion, because each term in the second expansion is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), so when you collect like terms, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be \\(6 \\times\\) the sum of the coefficients of all terms in the second expansion.\n\nBut wait, the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1/1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, then the coefficient would be \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). Hmm, but I'm not sure if that's correct because when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in one polynomial is multiplied by the entire other polynomial. So, in this case, \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term in the first polynomial, and when you multiply by the second polynomial, which is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would indeed be \\(6 \\times\\) the sum of the coefficients in the second polynomial.\n\nBut wait, another way to think about it is that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is just the coefficient from the first polynomial, because the second polynomial doesn't affect the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). So, maybe the coefficient is just 6, regardless of the second polynomial. But that doesn't seem right because the second polynomial is part of the product, so the entire product would have terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for various \\(k\\), but the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is the sum of all coefficients for terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to clarify: when you have a product of two expressions, the coefficient of a specific term in one part is multiplied by the entire other expression. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire second part. But that doesn't make sense because the second part is a polynomial in \\(c\\), so it's not a scalar. So, perhaps the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient from the first part, 6, multiplied by each term in the second part, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually be \\(6 \\times\\) the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which is 64, so 6*64=384.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) as separate variables, so the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of the second part, which is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. So, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, treating all variables together. So, in that case, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by various powers of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), but since the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, it would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, so 6*64=384.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it, and the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and the second part is irrelevant because it's multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), so the coefficient remains 6. But that seems too simplistic, and I'm not sure.\n\nWait, let me check the problem again: it says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, in the entire product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by every term from the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion, which is 6, multiplied by the entire second expansion. But since the second expansion is a polynomial in \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually be a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. Therefore, perhaps the problem is only considering the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, ignoring the second part, but that seems unlikely.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, considering all possible terms, but since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, so 6*64=384. But I'm not entirely sure.\n\nWait, perhaps a better approach is to think of the entire expression as a product of two independent expansions. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the first part, and when you multiply it by the entire second part, it's like distributing it across all terms of the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would indeed be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, so 6*64=384.\n\nBut let me verify this with a simpler example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). The expansion would be \\((a^2 + 2ab + b^2) \\times (c + 1/c)\\). The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in this product would be 1 (from \\(a^2\\)) times \\(c + 1/c\\), plus 2ab times \\(c + 1/c\\), plus \\(b^2\\) times \\(c + 1/c\\). But the term \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't exist in this product because \\(a^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c + 1/c\\), so the only term involving \\(a^2\\) is \\(a^2c\\) and \\(a^2/c\\). Similarly, the term \\(ab\\) would be multiplied by \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), giving \\(abc\\) and \\(ab/c\\), etc. So, in this case, there is no \\(a^2b^2\\) term because the second expansion only has degree 1 in \\(c\\) and \\(-1\\) in \\(c\\). So, perhaps in the original problem, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by various powers of \\(c\\), but the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would actually be zero because \\(a^2b^2\\) is not present in the product unless the second expansion has a constant term.\n\nWait, that's a good point. So, in the original problem, the second expansion is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Let's see if this expansion has a constant term, i.e., a term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. If it does, then when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), it would contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Otherwise, if there's no constant term, the coefficient would be zero.\n\nSo, let's check if \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) has a constant term. Using the binomial theorem, the general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(1/c\\right)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We want the exponent of \\(c\\) to be zero, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\). So, yes, there is a constant term when \\(k = 3\\). The coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20.\n\nTherefore, in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion will be multiplied by the constant term 20 from the second expansion, resulting in \\(20a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 20.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it might be 384, but now I'm getting 20. Which one is correct? Let me think again.\n\nSo, when you have two separate expansions multiplied together, the coefficient of a specific term in one part is multiplied by the entire expansion of the other part. However, in this case, we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\). So, the only way \\(a^2b^2\\) can appear in the product is if it's multiplied by a term in the second expansion that has \\(c^0\\), i.e., the constant term. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion.\n\nSo, from the first expansion, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. From the second expansion, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nWait, that makes sense. Because when you multiply the two expansions, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will only be present in the product if it's multiplied by a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), which is the constant term 20. So, the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nBut earlier I thought it might be 384, but that was because I was considering multiplying by all terms, but actually, only the constant term contributes to \\(a^2b^2\\) because any other term would introduce a \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), making the term \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) where \\(k \\neq 0\\), which wouldn't be \\(a^2b^2\\) alone.\n\nSo, to clarify, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion. Therefore, it's 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but let me confirm this with another example to make sure I'm not making a mistake. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^1 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). The expansion would be \\((a + b)(c + 1/c)\\). The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be zero because in the first expansion, the highest power of \\(a\\) is 1, and the second expansion doesn't have \\(a\\) or \\(b\\). So, that makes sense.\n\nAnother example: \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^2\\). The first expansion is \\(a^2 + 2ab + b^2\\), and the second is \\(c^2 + 2 + 1/c^2\\). The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 1 (from \\(a^2\\)) times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion, which is 2, so 1*2=2. But wait, in this case, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually be \\(a^2b^2 \\times 2\\), so the coefficient is 2. That seems correct.\n\nSo, applying that to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought about the sum of coefficients in the second expansion being 64, but that's only when you set \\(c = 1\\), which gives the sum of all coefficients. However, in this case, we're only interested in the constant term, which is 20, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nTherefore, after careful consideration, I think the correct coefficient is 120.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in calculating the constant term in the second expansion. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\times (1/c)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We want the exponent of \\(c\\) to be zero, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\). So, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). That's correct.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because earlier I thought the sum of coefficients in the second expansion is 64, but that's when you set \\(c = 1\\), which gives the total sum. But in this case, we're only interested in the constant term, which is 20, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nI think that's the correct answer. So, the coefficient is 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem for both parts of the expression.\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   We need the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2, which occurs when \\(k = 2\\):\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} a^{2}b^{2} = 6a^2b^2\n   \\]\n   So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in this part is 6.\n\n2. **Consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n   \\]\n   We need the constant term (where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0):\n   \\[\n   6 - 2k = 0 \\implies k = 3\n   \\]\n   The coefficient of the constant term is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\n   \\]\n\n3. **Combine the results:**\n   The term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion is multiplied by the constant term 20 from the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is:\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 20 = 120\n   \\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

    "text": " So, in this case, for \\((a + b)^4\\), the expansion would involve terms like \\(a^4\\), \\(a^3b\\), \\(a^2b^2\\), and so on, up to \\(b^4\\).\n\nSince the problem is asking specifically for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I think I can focus on that term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\). Let me write that out. The general term in the expansion is \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\\). So, for \\(a^2b^2\\), I need \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). That means the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\nBut wait, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I think I need to consider the expansion of both parts and then find the product that results in the term \\(a^2b^2\\). Hmm, but the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not involving \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\). So, does that mean that the part with \\(c\\) doesn't affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)? Because \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), right?\n\nLet me think. When you multiply two expressions together, each term in the first expression multiplies each term in the second expression. So, if I have \\((a + b)^4\\) times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), that term must come from the product of the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in \\((a + b)^4\\) and the constant term (the term with \\(c^0\\)) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because any term involving \\(c\\) would result in a term that includes \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), which we don't want.\n\nSo, I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let's expand that using the binomial theorem as well. The expansion is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying each term, that's \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m} = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\).\n\nWe need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, which means \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20.\n\nNow, going back to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) and the constant term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). That would be \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nWait, but let me double-check that. Is the term \\(a^2b^2\\) only affected by the constant term in the second expression? Yes, because any other term would introduce a power of \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), which wouldn't be present in \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient should indeed be 6 times 20, which is 120.\n\nHmm, but just to make sure I didn't make a mistake, let me go through the steps again. First, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Then, in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the constant term is when the exponent is zero, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which gives \\(m = 3\\), and the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying these together, 6 * 20 = 120. That seems right.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of the entire expression as a product of two expansions. The first part is \\((a + b)^4\\), and the second part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When you multiply these together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will only come from the product of the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first part and the constant term in the second part. Any other term in the second part would involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), which we don't want. So, yes, the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nI think that makes sense. So, I'm pretty confident that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Multiplying these gives the coefficient as \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\boxed{120}"

So, maybe the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part, but since we're only interested in the coefficient, perhaps it's just 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion? Wait, that doesn't sound quite right either.\n\nLet me think again. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When we multiply these two expansions, each term from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term from the second expansion. But since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which only involves \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), the terms from the second expansion must not involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\). But wait, the second expansion only has terms with \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), so when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), the resulting terms will have \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2 \\times (1/c)^k\\) for some exponent \\(k\\). But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would mean that the terms from the second expansion must contribute a constant term, i.e., the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. Because otherwise, the term would have \\(c\\) raised to some power, and thus not just \\(a^2b^2\\).\n\nSo, in other words, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is equal to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) (the constant term) in the second part. That makes sense because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by the constant term from the second expansion, you just get \\(a^2b^2\\) with the coefficient being the product of the two coefficients.\n\nSo, now I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let's expand that using the binomial theorem as well. The expansion is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying that, each term becomes \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m - m} = \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\).\n\nWe need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). Wait, that's not right because 6! is 720, but 3! is 6, so 720 divided by (6 times 6) is 720/36, which is indeed 20.\n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Therefore, going back to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the second part), which is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, let me double-check that. So, in the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. In the second part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. So, when we multiply these two, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by 20, giving 6 * 20 = 120 as the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression. That seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of the entire expression as the product of two polynomials, and when multiplying, the coefficients multiply. So, yes, that makes sense.\n\nWait, but just to make sure I'm not missing anything, let me consider an example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2\\) and \\((c + 1/c)^1 = c + 1/c\\). If I multiply them, I get \\(a^2c + a^2(1/c) + 2abc + 2ab(1/c) + b^2c + b^2(1/c)\\). The coefficient of \\(a^2\\) would be c + 1/c, but if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), it would be zero because there's no constant term in the second expansion. But in our case, the second expansion does have a constant term, so that's why we can multiply the coefficients.\n\nAnother way to think about it is that when you have two independent variables, the coefficients multiply when you're looking for a specific combination of exponents in each variable. So, since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), we only need the constant term from the \\(c\\) part, which is 20, and multiply it by the coefficient from the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) part, which is 6.\n\nSo, I think I'm confident that the coefficient is 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem.\n\nFirst, we expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n\\]\nWe need the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2. This occurs when \\(k = 2\\):\n\\[\n\\dbinom{4}{2} a^2b^2\n\\]\nCalculating the binomial coefficient:\n\\[\n\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\n\\]\nSo, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\nNext, we consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):\n\\[\n\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\n\\]\nSimplifying each term, we get:\n\\[\n\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n\\]\nWe need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, i.e., \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(m = 3\\). The coefficient of this term is:\n\\[\n\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = 20\n\\]\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficients from the two expansions:\n\\[\n6 \\times 20 = 120\n\\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}."

    "text": " So, maybe I can apply that here.\n\nAlright, let's look at the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\). I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, using the binomial theorem, the general term is \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\\). I want the term where \\(a^2b^2\\), which means \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). So, the coefficient would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Let me calculate that: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient from the first part is 6.\n\nNow, the second part of the expression is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I'm a bit confused here because I don't see any \\(a\\) or \\(b\\) terms here, just \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, does this part affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression? Wait, the entire expression is the product of \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when I multiply them together, each term from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term from the second expansion.\n\nBut the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). That term doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), right? So, when I multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by something from the second part, I'll get terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2 \\cdot c^{-k}\\), but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term without any \\(c\\)s, I think that term must come from multiplying \\(a^2b^2\\) by the constant term in the second expansion.\n\nWait, but the second expansion is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me check if it has a constant term. The general term in this expansion is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, for the exponent of \\(c\\) to be zero (i.e., the term is a constant), we need \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\). So, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} c^{0} = \\dbinom{6}{3}\\).\n\nCalculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20. Therefore, when I multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by this constant term, I get \\(6 \\times 20 \\times a^2b^2\\), which is \\(120a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient is 120.\n\nWait, let me make sure I didn't miss anything. The first part gave me 6 for \\(a^2b^2\\) and the second part, when expanded, has a constant term of 20. So, multiplying these together gives 6 * 20 = 120. That seems right. Alternatively, maybe I can think of the entire expression as a product, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient from the first part times the sum of coefficients from the second part that don't affect the \\(c\\) terms. But since we're only considering the term where \\(c\\) cancels out, it's just the constant term.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can consider that when I multiply the two expansions, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But only the constant term in the second expansion will result in a term that is \\(a^2b^2\\) times 1 (i.e., without any \\(c\\)s). All other terms would have \\(c\\) raised to some power, which we don't want. So, only the constant term contributes, and that's 20. So, 6 * 20 = 120. Yeah, that makes sense.\n\nI think that's the correct approach. So, the coefficient is 120. I don't think I made any mistakes here. The key was realizing that only the constant term in the second expansion would multiply with \\(a^2b^2\\) to give a term without any \\(c\\)s, and that term's coefficient is 20.

For \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the constant term (where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).

So, I think I need to consider both parts together. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), maybe I don't need to worry about the \\(c\\) terms? Let me think. \n\nWhen you multiply two expressions together, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression. So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), that term comes only from the product of the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in \\((a + b)^4\\) and the constant term (if any) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because if I multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by something else, it would change the variables, but we want just \\(a^2b^2\\). \n\nWait, actually, no. Let me correct that. When I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second part. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would mean that we are looking for the total contribution to the term \\(a^2b^2\\) after multiplying both expansions. \n\nWait, no, actually, hold on. Because \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are different variables from \\(c\\), so when you multiply, the variables don't interfere with each other. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part will be multiplied by every term in the second part, each contributing a coefficient. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part, because each term in the second part doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) variables. \n\nWait, that doesn't make sense. Let me think again. If I have \\((a + b)^4\\) times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), then each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is a term with \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) raised to some powers, and each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is a term with \\(c\\) raised to some power, either positive or negative. \n\nSo, when you multiply them together, the variables \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are all separate, so the only way to get a term with \\(a^2b^2\\) is to take the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from \\((a + b)^4\\) and multiply it by any term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), it would be multiplied by every term in the second expansion, each contributing a coefficient. \n\nWait, no, that's not correct. Because when you multiply, each term from the first expansion is multiplied by each term from the second expansion, so the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second part, each of which is a power of \\(c\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be present in the product as \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by each term in the second expansion, meaning that \\(a^2b^2\\) will have a coefficient equal to the sum of all the coefficients in the second expansion. \n\nWait, that seems complicated. Let me think of it another way. Let me denote the first part as \\(P = (a + b)^4\\) and the second part as \\(Q = \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the entire expression is \\(P \\times Q\\). \n\nIf I expand \\(P\\), I get terms like \\(a^4\\), \\(4a^3b\\), \\(6a^2b^2\\), \\(4ab^3\\), and \\(b^4\\). Similarly, expanding \\(Q\\) will give me terms involving \\(c^6\\), \\(6c^5\\), \\(15c^4\\), \\(20c^3\\), \\(15c^2\\), \\(6c\\), and \\(1\\) (since when \\(k = 6\\), the term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{6}c^0 = 1\\)). \n\nSo, when I multiply \\(P\\) and \\(Q\\), each term in \\(P\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(Q\\). So, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) from \\(P\\) will be multiplied by each term in \\(Q\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(P\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(Q\\). Because when you multiply \\(6a^2b^2\\) by each term in \\(Q\\), each term in \\(Q\\) is a coefficient times \\(c^k\\), so when you multiply, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) will be \\(6 \\times \\text{coefficient of } c^k \\text{ in } Q\\). \n\nBut the problem is asking only for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, does that mean we're considering all possible terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present, each multiplied by some power of \\(c\\)? But the problem statement doesn't specify anything about \\(c\\), so perhaps it's just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, considering all powers of \\(c\\). \n\nWait, that might not make sense because \\(a^2b^2\\) isn't a term that includes \\(c\\). So, actually, in the product \\(P \\times Q\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in \\(Q\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(P\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(Q\\). \n\nWait, let me test this with a simpler example. Suppose \\(P = a + b\\) and \\(Q = c + 1/c\\). Then, \\(P \\times Q = a(c + 1/c) + b(c + 1/c) = ac + a/c + bc + b/c\\). Now, if I look for the coefficient of \\(a\\), it's \\(c + 1/c\\), so the coefficient is \\(c + 1/c\\), but that's not a constant. Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. \n\nWait, perhaps I need to clarify: when the problem asks for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), it's considering the entire expression, which includes terms with different powers of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually be a polynomial in \\(c\\). But that seems odd because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, not an expression. \n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me check again: it says, \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4(c + 1/c)^6\\).\" So, maybe it's considering \\(a^2b^2\\) as a term, regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient would be the sum of all coefficients from \\(Q\\) multiplied by the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(P\\). \n\nWait, that makes sense. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\(P \\times Q\\) would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(P\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(Q\\). Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in \\(Q\\), you get \\(a^2b^2\\) times each coefficient, so the total coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) across all powers of \\(c\\) would be the sum of all coefficients in \\(Q\\) multiplied by 6. \n\nWait, let me confirm this approach. Let's denote the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(P\\) as \\(C_p = 6\\), and the sum of all coefficients in \\(Q\\) as \\(S_q\\). Then, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\(P \\times Q\\) would be \\(C_p \\times S_q\\). \n\nSo, first, let's find \\(C_p\\), which is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\). As I calculated earlier, that's 6.\n\nNext, I need to find the sum of all coefficients in \\(Q = \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The sum of all coefficients in a polynomial is found by evaluating the polynomial at \\(c = 1\\), because substituting \\(c = 1\\) makes each term equal to its coefficient. So, let's compute \\(Q(1)\\):\n\n\\[\nQ(1) = \\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = (1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\n\\]\n\nSo, the sum of all coefficients in \\(Q\\) is 64.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product \\(P \\times Q\\) is \\(C_p \\times S_q = 6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. Let me think of another way to approach this. Alternatively, when expanding the product, each term in \\(P\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(Q\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from \\(P\\) will be multiplied by each term in \\(Q\\), which are \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\\) for \\(k = 0\\) to \\(6\\). So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2c^{6 - 2k}\\) would be \\(6 \\times \\dbinom{6}{k}\\). \n\nBut the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would include all the terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present, regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the sum over all \\(k\\) of \\(6 \\times \\dbinom{6}{k}\\). \n\nWait, but that's the same as \\(6 \\times \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k}\\). And since \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} = 2^6 = 64\\), this again gives \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). \n\nSo, that seems consistent. Therefore, I think the coefficient is 384. But just to be thorough, let me check my steps again.\n\n1. Find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\). Using binomial coefficients, that's \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n\n2. Find the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). This is done by substituting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\(2^6 = 64\\).\n\n3. Multiply these two results together: \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\nYes, that seems correct. I don't see any mistakes in the reasoning. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is 384.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{384}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem and properties of polynomial multiplication.\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term with \\(a^2b^2\\) is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2}a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\n   \\]\n   So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\n2. **Find the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   The sum of all coefficients in a polynomial is found by evaluating the polynomial at \\(c = 1\\):\n   \\[\n   \\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\n   \\]\n\n3. **Multiply the coefficients:**\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the product of the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) and the sum of coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 64 = 384\n   \\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{384}\\)."

So, I need to consider the entire expression. But, hold on, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), right? So, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nBut since I'm only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't have any \\(c\\) terms, that means I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because when I multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by \\(c^0\\), I just get \\(a^2b^2\\), which is the term I want.\n\nSo, let me figure out the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\).\n\nI need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be 0, so I set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), I get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\).\n\nCalculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20.\n\nNow, since the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from \\((a + b)^4\\) has a coefficient of 6, and the term \\(c^0\\) from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) has a coefficient of 20, when I multiply these two parts together, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression will be \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nWait, let me double-check that. So, when I expand the product, each term from the first expansion is multiplied by each term from the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is multiplied by \\(c^0\\) in the second part, which is just 1. So, the coefficient is indeed 6 multiplied by 20, which is 120. \n\nIs there any other term that could contribute to \\(a^2b^2\\)? Let me think. If I had other terms in the second expansion, like \\(c^1\\) or \\(c^{-1}\\), but since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), any term with a non-zero power of \\(c\\) would result in a term that's not just \\(a^2b^2\\). So, only the \\(c^0\\) term contributes. Therefore, the coefficient is 120.\n\nWait, another way to think about it: the entire expression is the product of two expansions. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part, because when you multiply terms from each expansion, the exponents add. Since \\(a^2b^2\\) has exponents 2 and 2 for \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and 0 for \\(c\\), we need the corresponding terms from each expansion. So, yes, it's 6 times 20, which is 120.\n\nI think that's correct. Let me just recap: in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. In \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Multiplying these together gives 120. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem.\n\nFirst, consider the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\). Using the binomial theorem, the general term is given by:\n\\[\n\\binom{4}{k} a^{4 - k} b^k\n\\]\nFor the term \\(a^2b^2\\), we need \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). The coefficient is:\n\\[\n\\binom{4}{2} = \\frac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\n\\]\n\nNext, consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem, the general term is given by:\n\\[\n\\binom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\binom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n\\]\nWe need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, which occurs when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(m = 3\\). The coefficient is:\n\\[\n\\binom{6}{3} = \\frac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\n\\]\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficients from each expansion:\n\\[\n6 \\times 20 = 120\n\\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}."

    "text": " So, maybe I can apply that here.\n\nLet me start by focusing on the first part of the expression: \\((a + b)^4\\). If I expand this using the binomial theorem, each term will be of the form \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\\) where \\(k\\) ranges from 0 to 4. I'm specifically looking for the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2, which means I need \\(a^2b^2\\). So, let's find the value of \\(k\\) that gives me \\(a^{2}b^{2}\\). \n\nIn the term \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\\), the exponent of \\(a\\) is \\(4 - k\\) and the exponent of \\(b\\) is \\(k\\). I want both exponents to be 2, so \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). That makes sense. So, the term is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} a^{2}b^{2}\\). \n\nNow, calculating the binomial coefficient \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). I know that \\(\\dbinom{n}{k} = \\dfrac{n!}{k!(n - k)!}\\). So, plugging in the values, I get \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient from the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), for the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6.\n\nOkay, so now I have the first part done. The next part of the expression is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I'm a bit confused here because I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but this part involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). Wait, maybe I don't need to worry about this part for finding the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are different variables from \\(c\\). So, perhaps the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just 6 multiplied by whatever the entire second part evaluates to? Hmm, no, that doesn't seem right because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, which includes both parts.\n\nWait, but actually, the terms in the first part involve \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), while the terms in the second part involve \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, when we multiply them together, the variables \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are all different, so their exponents won't interfere with each other. That means the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product will just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire second part, right? Because the second part doesn't affect the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). So, the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nWait, but that doesn't sound quite right. Let me think again. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Since the terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) don't affect \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), maybe the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is simply 6 times the sum of all the terms in the second part, but that doesn't make sense because each term in the second part is multiplied by each term in the first part. Wait, no, actually, when you multiply two polynomials, each term from the first polynomial is multiplied by each term from the second polynomial. But since I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and the second part doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire second part. So, the coefficient is 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that seems like it would give me a term involving \\(c\\), which isn't part of \\(a^2b^2\\).\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, the entire expression is a product of two polynomials. When I multiply them, I'm looking for the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) appears, regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the sum of all the terms in the second polynomial, because each term in the first part (specifically the \\(a^2b^2\\) term) is multiplied by every term in the second part. But that would mean the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the sum of the coefficients of all terms in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't seem right because each term in the second part would contribute differently.\n\nWait, no, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient from the first part (which is 6) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients from the second part. Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second polynomial, each term contributes a coefficient, and since \\(a^2b^2\\) is present only once in the first part, the total coefficient would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients of the second part.\n\nBut let me check that. The sum of the coefficients of a polynomial is found by setting all variables to 1. So, for the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the sum of coefficients would be when \\(c = 1\\), so \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but that seems too straightforward. Let me think again. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so maybe I'm correct because each term in the second polynomial is being multiplied by the \\(a^2b^2\\) term, so the total coefficient would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 64, giving 384.\n\nBut let me approach it another way to verify. Let's consider expanding both parts separately and then multiplying them.\n\nFirst, the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is:\n\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n\\]\n\nAs we found earlier, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6.\n\nNow, the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is:\n\n\\[\n\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n\\]\n\nEach term here is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\) for \\(m = 0\\) to \\(6\\).\n\nNow, when we multiply these two expansions together, each term from the first expansion is multiplied by each term from the second expansion. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), we can ignore the terms from the second expansion because they involve \\(c\\) and not \\(a\\) or \\(b\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be the coefficient from the first expansion (which is 6) multiplied by the entire second expansion. But wait, that would mean the coefficient is 6 times the entire second expansion, which would make it a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not considering \\(c\\). Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating this.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). That is, in the entire product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by every possible term from the second expansion, each contributing a different power of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be the sum of all the coefficients from the second expansion, because each term in the second expansion is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), and the coefficients add up.\n\nWait, that makes sense. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 multiplied by the sum of the coefficients of the second polynomial. The sum of the coefficients of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by substituting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nBut let me check this another way. Let's consider that when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum of the products of the coefficients of terms whose variables multiply to give that specific term. In this case, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial is only affected by the constant term (with respect to \\(a\\) and \\(b\\)) in the second polynomial. Wait, no, that's not right because the second polynomial doesn't have \\(a\\) or \\(b\\). So, actually, when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by any term in the second polynomial, you're just adding a coefficient multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\) times some power of \\(c\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), it's the sum of all the coefficients from the second polynomial, because each term in the second polynomial contributes its coefficient to the term \\(a^2b^2\\) when multiplied by the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first polynomial.\n\nWait, that seems correct. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is indeed 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 64, giving 384.\n\nAlternatively, if I think about the entire expansion, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by every term from the second part, each contributing their own coefficient, so the total coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Since the sum of coefficients in the second part is 64, the total coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me confirm this by actually expanding the second part and adding up the coefficients. The second part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The sum of the coefficients is when \\(c = 1\\), so substituting \\(c = 1\\), we get \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, yes, the sum of the coefficients is 64.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in assuming that the sum of coefficients in the second part is 64. Let me calculate it manually.\n\nThe expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is:\n\n\\[\n\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\cdot c^{-m} = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n\\]\n\nThe coefficients are \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\) for each term. So, the sum of the coefficients is when \\(c = 1\\), so each term becomes \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\), and the sum is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} = 2^6 = 64\\). So, that's correct.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\). So, does that mean that the coefficient is 384, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms? Or is there a misunderstanding here?\n\nWait, no, in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the product will be of the form \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^{k} \\times \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, when you're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), you're looking at all the terms where \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\), which gives the coefficient as \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\), multiplied by each term \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). But since the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), the coefficient would be the sum over all \\(m\\) of \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} \\dbinom{6}{m}\\). So, that's 6 times the sum of \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\) for \\(m = 0\\) to \\(6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So, the coefficient is 384.\n\nWait, but let me just think again: when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in one polynomial is multiplied by every term in the other polynomial, and the coefficients add up. So, in this case, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first polynomial is multiplied by every term in the second polynomial, each contributing their own coefficient, so the total coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients from the second part.\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nI think I'm confident now that the coefficient is 384.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{384}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem for both parts of the expression.\n\n1. **Expanding \\((a + b)^4\\)**:\n   Using the binomial theorem, we have:\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term with \\(a^2b^2\\) occurs when \\(k = 2\\):\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\n   \\]\n   So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in this part is 6.\n\n2. **Considering the second part \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)**:\n   The sum of the coefficients of this polynomial is found by setting \\(c = 1\\):\n   \\[\n   \\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\n   \\]\n\n3. **Combining the results**:\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the product of the coefficient from the first part and the sum of the coefficients from the second part:\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 64 = 384\n   \\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression is \\(\\boxed{384}\\)."

But wait, the original problem is \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I need to consider the entire expression, which also includes the \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) part.\n\nHmm, so does the \\(a^2b^2\\) term get multiplied by something from the second part? Let me think. The expression is a product of two expansions: one in terms of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the other in terms of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). Since these are separate variables, when we multiply the two expansions together, the terms from each expansion multiply term by term.\n\nBut wait, the problem is specifically asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). That term comes only from the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), right? Because the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), which are different variables. So, when we multiply the two expansions, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. However, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\). So, does that mean we're looking for the coefficient when \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by the constant term (if any) in the second expansion?\n\nWait, no, that doesn't make sense because the second expansion doesn't have a constant term. Let me check that. Let me expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem as well.\n\nSo, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k\\). Simplifying that, we get:\n\n\\[\n\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} c^{-k} = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n\\]\n\nSo, the exponents on \\(c\\) will be \\(6, 4, 2, 0, -2, -4, -6\\) as \\(k\\) goes from 0 to 6. Therefore, the term with the exponent 0 is when \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\). So, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} c^{0} = 20\\). Therefore, the constant term is 20.\n\nWait, so if I take the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first expansion, which is \\(6a^2b^2\\), and multiply it by the constant term from the second expansion, which is 20, then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nBut hold on, is that the only term that contributes to \\(a^2b^2\\)? Let me think again. When we multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, for example, \\(a^4\\) is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, \\(4a^3b\\) is multiplied by each term, and so on.\n\nBut we are only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, in the product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will come from multiplying the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first expansion by each term in the second expansion, but only the term in the second expansion that doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), because otherwise, the term would have \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\) in it, which would make it not just \\(a^2b^2\\).\n\nWait, but actually, the problem is written as \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when we multiply these two expressions together, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, for example, \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion would be multiplied by \\(c^6\\), \\(6c^4\\), \\(15c^2\\), \\(20\\), \\(15c^{-2}\\), \\(6c^{-4}\\), and \\(c^{-6}\\) from the second expansion.\n\nBut the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, that term would be present only when the second factor contributes a term that is \\(c^0\\), because otherwise, the term would have \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\) in it, making it not a pure \\(a^2b^2\\) term. Therefore, the only contribution to \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from multiplying \\(a^2b^2\\) by the constant term in the second expansion, which is 20.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient would be \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. Is there any other term in the first expansion that could contribute to \\(a^2b^2\\) when multiplied by a term from the second expansion? For instance, could a term like \\(a^3b\\) from the first expansion, when multiplied by a term from the second expansion, result in \\(a^2b^2\\)?\n\nHmm, let me think. If I take \\(a^3b\\) and multiply it by something from the second expansion, can I get \\(a^2b^2\\)? Well, the second expansion only has terms with \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), so unless there's a term with \\(1/a\\) or something, which there isn't, I can't reduce the exponent of \\(a\\) from 3 to 2. Similarly, I can't increase or decrease the exponents of \\(a\\) or \\(b\\) through multiplication with the second expansion because those terms only involve \\(c\\).\n\nTherefore, the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is by multiplying the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first expansion by the constant term from the second expansion. So, that would indeed give me \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nBut wait, let me check this again because sometimes when dealing with multiple variables, it's easy to make a mistake. Let me write out the product more explicitly.\n\nThe entire expression is:\n\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = (a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4) \\times (c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15c^{-2} + 6c^{-4} + c^{-6})\n\\]\n\nSo, when I multiply these two polynomials together, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. So, for example, \\(a^4\\) is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial, resulting in terms like \\(a^4c^6\\), \\(4a^4c^4\\), etc. Similarly, \\(4a^3b\\) is multiplied by each term, resulting in terms like \\(4a^3bc^6\\), \\(24a^3bc^4\\), etc.\n\nBut when looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I need to find all the terms in the product where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2 and 2, respectively. So, let's see which terms in the first polynomial, when multiplied by terms in the second polynomial, result in \\(a^2b^2\\).\n\nLooking at the first polynomial, the only term with \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(6a^2b^2\\). When this term is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial, it will produce terms like \\(6a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(36a^2b^2c^4\\), etc. However, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would only be the term where the exponents of \\(c\\) are zero, i.e., the constant term.\n\nSo, the term \\(6a^2b^2 \\times 20 = 120a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient is 120.\n\nWait, but let me make sure there isn't another term in the first polynomial that, when multiplied by a term in the second polynomial, could result in \\(a^2b^2\\). For example, could a term like \\(a^3b\\) from the first polynomial, when multiplied by a term involving \\(1/a\\), result in \\(a^2b^2\\)? But in the second polynomial, all terms are in \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), so they don't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\) at all. Therefore, it's impossible for any term in the second polynomial to affect the exponents of \\(a\\) or \\(b\\) in the first polynomial.\n\nTherefore, the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is by taking the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first polynomial and multiplying it by the constant term from the second polynomial. So, the coefficient is indeed 6 multiplied by 20, which is 120.\n\nJust to double-check, let me consider the entire expansion. The first polynomial has terms up to \\(a^4\\) and \\(b^4\\), and the second polynomial has terms involving \\(c^6\\) down to \\(c^{-6}\\). When multiplied together, the cross terms will have combinations like \\(a^4c^6\\), \\(a^4c^4\\), etc., but none of these will affect the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). So, the only term contributing to \\(a^2b^2\\) is the product of the \\(a^2b^2\\) term and the constant term in the second expansion.\n\nTherefore, I'm confident that the coefficient is 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we start by expanding each part separately using the binomial theorem.\n\nFirst, we expand \\((a + b)^4\\):\n\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\dbinom{4}{0}a^4 + \\dbinom{4}{1}a^3b + \\dbinom{4}{2}a^2b^2 + \\dbinom{4}{3}ab^3 + \\dbinom{4}{4}b^4\n\\]\n\nCalculating the coefficients, we get:\n\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\n\\]\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in this expansion is 6.\n\nNext, we expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):\n\n\\[\n\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n\\]\n\nThe constant term (where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0) occurs when \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\). The constant term is:\n\n\\[\n\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\n\\]\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, we multiply the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion by the constant term from the second expansion:\n\n\\[\n6 \\times 20 = 120\n\\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

    "text": " So, maybe I can apply that here.\n\nThe given expression is \\((a + b)^4\\), so n is 4. I need the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Let me think, in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\), each term is of the form \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\\). So, for the term where \\(a^2b^2\\), that would mean \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). Therefore, the coefficient would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Let me compute that: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\nBut wait, the problem is asking for the coefficient in the entire expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Hmm, so I think I need to consider the expansion of both parts together. But actually, since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\), and \\(1/c\\) are different variables, their exponents won't interfere with each other. So, maybe the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just the same as in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, no, that doesn't make sense because when you multiply two expressions, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that can't be right because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, not an expression involving \\(c\\).\n\nWait, maybe I misunderstood the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, perhaps they are treating \\(c\\) as another variable, and the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is just in the first part, and the second part is multiplied by it. So, maybe the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that seems odd because the problem is likely expecting a numerical coefficient, not an expression with \\(c\\). Alternatively, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient in the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), and the second part is irrelevant. But that doesn't seem right either.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think again. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) is only in the \\((a + b)^4\\) part, and the other part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. So, when you multiply the two expressions together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is 6 times a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for a coefficient, which is a number, so maybe I'm missing something.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, so the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by all possible terms from the second expansion, but since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, maybe it's just the coefficient from the first part, and the second part contributes a factor that is the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me check that.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is miswritten, and they actually want the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out. Because if they just want the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\), then it would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which isn't a single number. So, maybe they actually want the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when multiplied by \\(c^0\\), which would mean the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). That makes more sense because then the coefficient would be a number.\n\nSo, let me proceed under that assumption. So, first, find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6. Then, find the constant term (i.e., the coefficient of \\(c^0\\)) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Then, multiply these two coefficients together to get the final coefficient for the term \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire expression.\n\nAlright, so let's compute the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Again, using the binomial theorem: \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\), which is \\(\\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = 20\\). Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, 6! is 720, 3! is 6, so 6!/(3!3!) is 720/(6*6) = 720/36 = 20. Yes, that's correct.\n\nSo, the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire expression is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the second part), which is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm interpreting the problem correctly. The problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)\". If it's just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, then the coefficient would actually be 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which would mean that the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But that seems unlikely because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, not a polynomial. So, perhaps the intended interpretation is that we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when the entire expression is expanded, and considering all possible terms, but only the term where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out (i.e., \\(c^0\\)).\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, and the second part is irrelevant, but that seems odd because the problem includes both parts.\n\nWait, perhaps I should think of it differently. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When you expand this, each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first part, and it's multiplied by every term from the second part. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 (the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\)) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), meaning the constant term in \\(c\\). That would make sense because then the coefficient would be a number. So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which we found to be 20, so 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without considering \\(c\\), then the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial, but the problem is likely expecting a numerical answer, so I think the correct interpretation is that they want the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nLet me double-check my calculations. First, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Then, in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the constant term is when the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, which occurs when \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), so \\(k = 3\\). The coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, multiplying 6 and 20 gives 120. That seems correct.\n\nWait, another way to think about it: when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each polynomial. But in this case, since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would indeed be 6 times the entire expansion of the second polynomial. But since the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, perhaps they are considering only the constant term in \\(c\\), so it's 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nAlternatively, if they are considering the entire expression, then the coefficient would be 6 times the entire polynomial, but that's not a single number. So, I think the intended answer is 120, considering the constant term in \\(c\\).\n\nWait, but let me make sure. Let me consider the entire expansion. So, \\((a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). And \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) expands to a sum of terms with various powers of \\(c\\). When you multiply these together, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), meaning that the coefficient is a polynomial, not a single number. Therefore, unless the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some specific \\(k\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) alone is not a single number but a polynomial in \\(c\\).\n\nBut the problem is asking for \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", so perhaps they are considering the term where \\(c\\) is raised to the zero power, i.e., the constant term. So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times 20, which is 120. That makes sense, and that's likely the intended answer.\n\nSo, to recap: The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire expression is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but let me check if I'm not making a mistake here. Another way to think about it: When you have two independent variables, \\(a, b\\) and \\(c\\), their exponents don't interfere. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is multiplied by every term in the second part, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, not a number. Therefore, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), which would be 6 times the entire expansion, but that's not a single number. So, I think the intended interpretation is that they want the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nTherefore, I think the answer is 120.\n\nWait, let me just make sure I didn't make a mistake in calculating the constant term. So, in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - k} \\times (1/c)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, setting \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), we get \\(k = 3\\). The coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, yes, that's correct.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120. So, I think that's the answer.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Multiplying these gives the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) as 120.\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\boxed{120}."

    "text": " So, maybe I can apply that here.\n\nAlright, so for \\((a + b)^4\\), let's expand that first. Using the binomial theorem, the expansion would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{0}a^4b^0 + \\dbinom{4}{1}a^3b^1 + \\dbinom{4}{2}a^2b^2 + \\dbinom{4}{3}a^1b^3 + \\dbinom{4}{4}a^0b^4\\). Calculating the coefficients, that would be \\(1a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + 1b^4\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) here is 6. Got that part down.\n\nNow, the other part of the expression is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I need to figure out how this part affects the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, but \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), right? So, maybe the terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) don't directly affect the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. Hmm, that might mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just 6 times whatever the coefficient is in the second part. But actually, no, because the entire expression is the product of \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), so when we multiply them, each term from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term from the second expansion. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), maybe the terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) will just contribute a coefficient that's multiplied by 6, but we don't need to worry about the powers of \\(c\\), because the problem is only asking about \\(a^2b^2\\). So perhaps the coefficient remains 6, but I'm not sure. Let me think again.\n\nWait, no, maybe that's not right. Because when you multiply two polynomials, each term from the first polynomial is multiplied by each term from the second. So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), it's just the term from the first expansion, which is 6a^2b^2, multiplied by the entire second expansion. But since the second expansion has terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), which don't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms, does that mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is just 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in the second expansion? Wait, that doesn't sound right because the second expansion isn't a constant; it's a polynomial in \\(c\\). So, actually, when you multiply 6a^2b^2 by each term in the second expansion, each term will have a different power of \\(c\\), but since we're only asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), perhaps we're supposed to consider the entire coefficient regardless of \\(c\\). Wait, but the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), without any restriction on \\(c\\), so maybe it's 6 multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients in the second expansion.\n\nWait, but the sum of all the coefficients in the second expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), right? Because substituting \\(c = 1\\) into \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of the coefficients is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 * 64 = 384. Hmm, that seems plausible, but I'm not entirely sure. Let me check again.\n\nWait, maybe that's not the right approach. Alternatively, perhaps the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just 6, and the rest of the expression involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) doesn't affect it. But that doesn't seem right because when you multiply two expressions, each term from the first is multiplied by each term from the second. So, maybe the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part, but since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), it's actually 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in the second expansion. But that would mean 6 * 64 = 384, as I thought earlier.\n\nWait, but let me think differently. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, in the product, each term will be of the form (something with a and b) times (something with c). So, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term comes only from the 6a^2b^2 in the first part multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients in the second expansion, because each term in the second expansion, when multiplied by 6a^2b^2, contributes 6 times that coefficient to the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. So, the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion is indeed when \\(c = 1\\), which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me confirm that approach. Let's take a simpler example: suppose I have \\((a + b)^1 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, the expansion is \\((a + b)(c + 1/c)\\). The coefficient of \\(a^1b^0\\) would be 1 * (c + 1/c), so the coefficient is (1)(1 + 1) = 2, because when c=1, the second expression is 2. Similarly, the coefficient of \\(a^0b^1\\) would be 1 * (c + 1/c), which is also 2. So, in that case, the coefficients are multiplied by the sum of the coefficients in the second expression. So, that seems to support the approach.\n\nTherefore, in our original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 64, so the total coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me check another way. Let's compute the product \\((a + b)^4 \\times (c + 1/c)^6\\). The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6a^2b^2, and when multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - k}(1/c)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, each term in the second expansion is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\\).\n\nTherefore, when we multiply 6a^2b^2 by each of these terms, we get 6 \\times \\dbinom{6}{k}a^2b^2c^{6 - 2k}. So, the coefficient for each \\(a^2b^2c^{6 - 2k}\\) is 6 \\times \\dbinom{6}{k}. But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), without any restriction on \\(c\\), that is, regardless of the power of \\(c\\), the total coefficient would be the sum over all k from 0 to 6 of 6 \\times \\dbinom{6}{k}.\n\nBut the sum of \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}\\) from k=0 to 6 is 2^6 = 64, so the total coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384, as I thought before.\n\nWait, but let me make sure. Another way to think about it is that the entire expression is the product of two polynomials, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial and the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial. Because when you multiply, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second, so the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the product is the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first polynomial times every term from the second polynomial. So, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 64, giving 384.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem had asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^m\\) for some specific m, then we would have to compute a specific term, but since it's just \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\), it's 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 64, so 6*64=384.\n\nWait, but let me check that approach with a smaller exponent to see if it holds. Let's say we have \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, expanding \\((a + b)^2\\) gives \\(a^2 + 2ab + b^2\\). Expanding \\((c + 1/c)^1\\) gives \\(c + 1/c\\). Now, the product is \\((a^2 + 2ab + b^2)(c + 1/c)\\). The coefficient of \\(a^2\\) in this product would be 1*(c + 1/c), so the coefficient is (1 + 1) = 2 when c=1, which is correct because the sum of coefficients in the second polynomial is 2. Similarly, the coefficient of \\(ab\\) would be 2*(c + 1/c), so the coefficient is 2*(1 + 1) = 4. And the coefficient of \\(b^2\\) would be 1*(c + 1/c), so 2. So, in this case, the coefficients are indeed multiplied by the sum of the coefficients in the second polynomial. So, this seems to confirm the approach.\n\nTherefore, in our original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 64, so 6*64=384.\n\nWait, but just to be thorough, let me compute the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). The sum of the coefficients occurs when we set \\(c = 1\\), so substituting \\(c = 1\\), we get \\((1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, if I didn't want to substitute \\(c = 1\\), I could expand \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem: \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k}(1/c)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). The sum of the coefficients would then be when \\(c = 1\\), so each term becomes \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}\\), and the sum is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} = 2^6 = 64\\).\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Is there another way this could be approached? Maybe by considering the multinomial theorem or something else? Hmm, but since the variables are separate, I think the approach is correct.\n\nSo, to recap: The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nI think that's solid. I've checked it with a smaller example, and the reasoning holds. So, the final answer should be 384.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{384}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem.\n\nFirst, we expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n\\]\nThe term containing \\(a^2b^2\\) is:\n\\[\n\\dbinom{4}{2} a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\n\\]\nSo, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\nNext, we consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The sum of the coefficients in this expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\):\n\\[\n\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\n\\]\n\nWhen multiplying the two expansions, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient is:\n\\[\n6 \\times 64 = 384\n\\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is \\(\\boxed{384}\\)."

    "text": " So, maybe I can apply that here.\n\nAlright, looking at \\((a + b)^4\\), I can expand this part first. Let me write out the expansion. The general term in the expansion would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\\) where \\(k\\) goes from 0 to 4. So, the terms would be:\n\n- When \\(k = 0\\): \\(\\dbinom{4}{0} a^4 b^0 = 1 \\cdot a^4 \\cdot 1 = a^4\\)\n- When \\(k = 1\\): \\(\\dbinom{4}{1} a^3 b^1 = 4 \\cdot a^3 b\\)\n- When \\(k = 2\\): \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} a^2 b^2 = 6 \\cdot a^2 b^2\\)\n- When \\(k = 3\\): \\(\\dbinom{4}{3} a^1 b^3 = 4 \\cdot a b^3\\)\n- When \\(k = 4\\): \\(\\dbinom{4}{4} a^0 b^4 = 1 \\cdot b^4\\)\n\nSo, the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is \\(a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). Cool, now I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is 6. But wait, the problem isn't just \\((a + b)^4\\), it's multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I can't just stop here; I need to consider the entire expression.\n\nHmm, so the expression is \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I'm supposed to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). But wait, in the entire expression, the variables are \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\), and \\(1/c\\). The term \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\) at all, right? So, when I multiply the two expansions together, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by every term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), that means I need the part of the product where the \\(a^2b^2\\) term is multiplied by a term that is just a constant (i.e., no \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\) involved). But wait, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) doesn't have a constant term, does it? Let me check that.\n\nWait, actually, when you expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, the exponent of \\(c\\) is \\(6 - 2k\\). For the term to be a constant (i.e., \\(c^0\\)), we need \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\). So, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} c^{0} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20.\n\nTherefore, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion will be multiplied by 20 from the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 (from the first expansion) multiplied by 20 (the constant term from the second expansion), which is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait a second, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 20. So, when you multiply these two together, the coefficient becomes 6 * 20 = 120. That seems right.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should think about it as the entire expansion. The entire expression is the product of two expansions. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) can only come from multiplying the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in \\((a + b)^4\\) with the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Since all other terms in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) have a power of \\(c\\), which would introduce \\(c\\) terms into the product, but since we're only looking for \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't have any \\(c\\) terms, those other products would result in terms that include \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), which we don't want. Therefore, only the constant term from the second expansion contributes to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\).\n\nSo, yeah, I think 120 is the correct coefficient.\n\nWait, just to make sure, let me write out the expansions again.\n\nFirst, \\((a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\).\n\nSecond, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(1/c\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\).\n\nSo, the constant term is when \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), so \\(k = 3\\), which gives \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\), so that's correct.\n\nTherefore, when multiplying the two expansions, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, to get the term \\(a^2b^2\\), we need to take the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first expansion and multiply it by the constant term from the second expansion, which is 20. So, the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, another way to think about it is that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the product of the coefficients of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and the constant term in the second part. Since the second part doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms, it just scales the entire expression by its constant term.\n\nSo, I think I'm confident that 120 is the correct coefficient.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem.\n\nFirst, we expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n\\]\nThe term containing \\(a^2b^2\\) is:\n\\[\n\\dbinom{4}{2} a^2 b^2 = 6 a^2 b^2\n\\]\nSo, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\nNext, we consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem:\n\\[\n\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n\\]\nThe constant term (where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0) occurs when \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\).

I'm specifically looking for the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2, so that would be \\(a^2b^2\\).

But that seems complicated because the sum of the coefficients in a binomial expansion is found by setting the variable to 1.

But wait, that seems too high. Let me think again.\n\nWait, no, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product. But \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\) at all, so maybe the coefficient is just 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that doesn't make sense because the problem is likely expecting a numerical coefficient, not an expression involving \\(c\\).\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me re-examine the problem. It says, \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, when you expand the entire product, each term will be of the form \\(a^2b^2 \\times \\text{something with } c\\).

Let me check.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm misinterpreting the problem. Maybe it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the powers of \\(c\\), so the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which would make the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) as 6 * \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that can't be right because coefficients are numbers, not expressions.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is only considering terms where the exponents of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) cancel out, so that the term is a constant. But the problem doesn't specify that, so I think I should consider all possible exponents of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would indeed be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me think again. When you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion is multiplied by every term in the second expansion, which includes terms like \\(c^6\\), \\(c^4\\), etc., down to \\(c^{-6}\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. So, the coefficient is 384.\n\nWait, but let me make sure. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where the exponents of \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are 2, 2, and 0 respectively. That would make more sense because otherwise, the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\), not a number. So, perhaps I need to find the coefficient where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\).\n\nIf that's the case, then I need to compute the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), then multiply them together.\n\nSo, first, as before, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n\nNext, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) can be found using the binomial theorem as well. The general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be 0, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product is \\(6 * 20 = 120\\). So, the coefficient is 120.\n\nWait, but the problem didn't specify anything about \\(c\\), it just said the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, maybe it's expecting the coefficient regardless of \\(c\\), which would be 384 as I thought earlier. But that seems too large, and perhaps the problem expects the term where \\(c\\) cancels out, i.e., \\(c^0\\). Let me check the problem statement again.\n\nThe problem says: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" It doesn't specify anything about \\(c\\), so maybe it's just looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. That would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. But I'm not sure because usually, when a problem asks for a coefficient in a product of two expressions, it's considering the term where the variables in question are present, and the other variables are allowed to be any exponent. So, perhaps the answer is 384.\n\nWait, but let me think again. If I have \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), then when I expand it, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part would be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, which includes \\(c^6\\), \\(c^4\\), ..., down to \\(c^{-6}\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nBut I'm a bit confused because I thought maybe the problem wanted the term where \\(c\\) cancels out, but since it's not specified, perhaps it's indeed 384. Let me verify this.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, and the entire expression \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is multiplied by that, so the coefficient would be 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that can't be right because the coefficient is a number, not an expression. Therefore, perhaps the problem is expecting the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), which would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me check the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). When you set \\(c = 1\\), you get \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\), which is correct. So, the sum of coefficients is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 384.\n\nBut I'm still a bit unsure because sometimes problems might expect the term where \\(c\\) is zero, but that's not the case here. Alternatively, maybe I should consider that the problem is only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be 6 * 20 = 120. Hmm, I think I need to clarify this.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is written in such a way that it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), meaning that \\(c\\) terms can be anything, so the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which would make the coefficient a polynomial in \\(c\\). But that doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a coefficient, which is a number, not an expression. Therefore, I think the problem must be asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\), which would be 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but the problem didn't specify \\(c^0\\), so perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me see. If the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then it's 6 times the sum of coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, if it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), it's 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nI think I need to look back at the problem statement. It says: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), without any mention of \\(c\\). So, in the product, each term is of the form \\(a^k b^{4 - k} \\times c^m\\), where \\(k\\) is from 0 to 4, and \\(m\\) can range from -6 to 6. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the sum over all \\(m\\) of the coefficients from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) multiplied by the coefficient 6 from \\((a + b)^4\\). So, that would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient is 384. But I'm still a bit confused because sometimes problems expect you to consider only the constant term, but since it's not specified, I think 384 is the correct answer.\n\nWait, but let me think again. If I have \\((a + b)^4\\) times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), then when you multiply them, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is present in the first part, and it's multiplied by every term in the second part. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that can't be right because the coefficient should be a number, not an expression. Therefore, perhaps the problem is expecting the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by the constant term in the second expansion, which is 20, so 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but the problem didn't specify any restriction on \\(c\\), so maybe it's just 384. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is miswritten and they actually want the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be 120. Hmm, I'm not sure. Let me try to see which one makes more sense.\n\nIf I take the entire expansion, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384. But that seems very large, and I think the problem is more likely expecting the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nWait, perhaps I should look for the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\). So, that would be the product of the coefficients from each expansion where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out. So, as I calculated earlier, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part is 20, so the product is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nYes, I think that's more likely what the problem is asking for. Because if it were asking for the coefficient regardless of \\(c\\), it would be 384, but that seems too big and probably not the intended answer. So, I think the correct answer is 120.\n\nWait, but to make sure, let me think about how the product would look. When you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by \\(c^6\\), \\(6c^4\\), \\(15c^2\\), \\(20\\), \\(15c^{-2}\\), \\(6c^{-4}\\), and \\(c^{-6}\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would include all these terms multiplied by 6. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^6\\) is 6 * 1 = 6, \\(a^2b^2c^4\\) is 6 * 6 = 36, \\(a^2b^2c^2\\) is 6 * 15 = 90, \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is 6 * 20 = 120, and so on. So, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), it's the sum of all these coefficients, which is 6 + 36 + 90 + 120 + 90 + 36 + 6 = let's see, 6 + 36 is 42, plus 90 is 132, plus 120 is 252, plus 90 is 342, plus 36 is 378, plus 6 is 384. So, that's correct.\n\nBut if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), it's 120. Since the problem didn't specify, I think it's more likely that they want the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. So, I'll go with that.\n\nWait, but I'm still a bit confused because the problem didn't specify \\(c^0\\). Maybe I should check if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms, which would mean \\(c^0\\). So, perhaps the answer is 120. Alternatively, if it's asking for the coefficient regardless of \\(c\\), it's 384. But I think 120 is more likely the intended answer because it's more specific.\n\nWait, let me try another approach. Let's consider that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product. Since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would include all terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any power of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384. So, the coefficient is 384.\n\nBut now I'm really confused because I can't decide whether it's 120 or 384. Let me think about similar problems I've seen before. Usually, when a problem asks for the coefficient of a term in a product of two expressions, it's considering the term where the variables in question are present, and the other variables can be anything. So, in this case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would include all possible powers of \\(c\\), so it's 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 384.\n\nBut wait, let me think about it differently. Suppose I have two expressions: \\( (a + b)^4 = A \\) and \\( (c + 1/c)^6 = B \\). Then, the product is \\( A \\times B \\). When I expand \\( A \\times B \\), each term in \\( A \\) is multiplied by each term in \\( B \\). So, the term \\( a^2b^2 \\) in \\( A \\) is multiplied by every term in \\( B \\), which includes terms like \\( c^6 \\), \\( 6c^4 \\), etc., down to \\( c^{-6} \\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\( a^2b^2 \\) in the product \\( A \\times B \\) is the coefficient of \\( a^2b^2 \\) in \\( A \\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\( B \\). The sum of all coefficients in \\( B \\) is found by setting \\( c = 1 \\), which gives \\( (1 + 1)^6 = 64 \\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\( 6 \\times 64 = 384 \\).\n\nYes, I think that's correct. So, the coefficient of \\( a^2b^2 \\) in the product is 384.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was 120 because I considered only the constant term in \\( B \\). But I think the correct interpretation is that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\( a^2b^2 \\) regardless of the power of \\( c \\), so it's 384.\n\nWait, let me confirm this with an example. Suppose I have \\( (a + b)^1 \\times (c + 1/c)^1 = (a + b)(c + 1/c) \\). The coefficient of \\( a^1b^0 \\) would be the coefficient of \\( a \\) in the first part times the sum of coefficients in the second part. The coefficient of \\( a \\) is 1, and the sum of coefficients in \\( c + 1/c \\) is 2, so the coefficient of \\( a \\) in the product would be 1 * 2 = 2. Indeed, expanding \\( (a + b)(c + 1/c) \\) gives \\( ac + a/c + bc + b/c \\). So, the coefficient of \\( a \\) is 2, as calculated. So, in this case, the coefficient of \\( a \\) is 2, which is 1 (from \\( a \\) in the first part) times 2 (sum of coefficients in the second part). Therefore, applying this logic, in the original problem, the coefficient of \\( a^2b^2 \\) would be 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So, the correct answer is 384.\n\nWait, but in my earlier example, the coefficient of \\( a \\) is 2, which is 1 * 2. So, applying the same logic, in the original problem, it's 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nTherefore, I think the correct answer is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n\\boxed{384}"

    "text": " So maybe I can apply that here.\n\nAlright, looking at the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\). I want the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2 because the problem is asking for \\(a^2b^2\\). So, using the binomial theorem, the coefficient for \\(a^{2}b^{2}\\) would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\), right? Let me calculate that: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\\). So, the coefficient from the first part is 6.\n\nNow, the second part of the expression is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Hmm, this also looks like a binomial expansion. But wait, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\). Does that mean the coefficient from the second part doesn't matter? Or do I need to consider something else?\n\nWait, actually, the entire expression is the product of \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when we multiply these two expansions together, each term from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term from the second expansion. But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), that means we're only interested in the terms where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2, regardless of what happens with \\(c\\).\n\nSo, in other words, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. Because when you multiply, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part will be multiplied by every term in the second part, but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), the \\(c\\) terms don't affect the exponent of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). Therefore, the coefficient would just be 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion.\n\nWait, is that right? Let me think again. The second expansion is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). If I expand this, each term will be of the form \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, each term has a coefficient \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}\\) and a power of \\(c\\) which is \\(6 - 2k\\). But since we're multiplying this by \\(a^2b^2\\), which is part of the first expansion, the \\(c\\) terms don't interact with the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. So, when we consider the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), it's just the coefficient from the first part, 6, multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part.\n\nBut wait, no, that's not quite right. Because when you multiply two expressions, each term from the first is multiplied by each term from the second. So, if I take the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first expansion, which is \\(6a^2b^2\\), and multiply it by every term in the second expansion, each of those products will be terms in the final expanded form. However, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that includes only \\(a^2b^2\\) and some powers of \\(c\\). But since the problem is just asking for the coefficient, not the entire term, I think it's sufficient to just take the coefficient from the first part and multiply it by the entire second expansion's coefficients summed up.\n\nWait, but actually, no. Because each term in the second expansion is separate. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be the coefficient from the first part, 6, multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients from the second expansion. Because when you multiply \\(6a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, each of those will have a coefficient, and when you add them all together, it's like multiplying \\(6a^2b^2\\) by the sum of all the coefficients in the second expansion.\n\nWait, that might not be correct either. Let me think again. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when you expand this, each term will be of the form \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}a^{4 - k}b^{k} \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - m} \\times \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). So, each term is \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}\\dbinom{6}{m} a^{4 - k}b^{k} c^{6 - 2m}\\).\n\nNow, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, we need to find all terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present, regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in the first part, \\(a^{4 - k}b^{k}\\), we set \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). So, \\(k = 2\\), which gives us \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). So, the coefficient from the first part is 6, as I found earlier.\n\nNow, for the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the coefficient for each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\), and the exponent of \\(c\\) is \\(6 - 2m\\). But since we're multiplying this by \\(a^2b^2\\), which is independent of \\(c\\), the entire coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be 6 multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients from the second expansion.\n\nWait, no. Actually, each term in the product will have a coefficient that is the product of the coefficients from each part. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^{6 - 2m}\\) will be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\dbinom{6}{m}\\). But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), we need to sum all these coefficients for all possible \\(m\\).\n\nWait, that makes sense. Because in the product, \\(a^2b^2\\) can be multiplied by any power of \\(c\\), so the total coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) is the sum over all \\(m\\) of \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\dbinom{6}{m}\\). So, that would be 6 times the sum of \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\) for \\(m\\) from 0 to 6.\n\nBut wait, the sum of \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\) from \\(m = 0\\) to \\(6\\) is \\(2^6 = 64\\). So, does that mean the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\)? That seems high, but let me check.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), it's equivalent to multiplying the coefficient from the first part by the entire expansion of the second part. So, the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is indeed 64, so 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Each term in the product is a term from the first expansion multiplied by a term from the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion is multiplied by every term in the second expansion, which has coefficients from \\(\\dbinom{6}{0}\\) to \\(\\dbinom{6}{6}\\). So, each of these will contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, but with different powers of \\(c\\). So, when you add all these contributions together, you get the total coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\), which is the sum of all the coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by 6.\n\nSo, yes, that would be 6 * (2^6) = 6 * 64 = 384. So, the coefficient is 384.\n\nWait, but let me confirm this with another approach. Let's consider that \\((a + b)^4\\) has the term \\(6a^2b^2\\), and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) has a sum of coefficients equal to \\(2^6 = 64\\). So, when you multiply these two, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 * 64 = 384. That seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of the entire expression as a product of two polynomials. The first polynomial is in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the second is in \\(c\\). So, when you multiply them, the coefficients of the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are independent of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the entire second expansion's coefficients summed together. So, yes, 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. Sometimes, when dealing with products of polynomials, the coefficients can interfere, but in this case, since the variables are separate, I think it's correct.\n\nAlternatively, let me consider a simpler example to test this approach. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, expanding \\((a + b)^2\\) gives \\(a^2 + 2ab + b^2\\), and \\((c + 1/c)\\) is just \\(c + 1/c\\). So, the product would be \\(a^2(c + 1/c) + 2ab(c + 1/c) + b^2(c + 1/c)\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) would be 1 * (1 + 1) = 2, because \\(c + 1/c\\) has coefficients 1 and 1. Similarly, the coefficient of \\(ab\\) would be 2 * (1 + 1) = 4, and the coefficient of \\(b^2\\) would be 1 * (1 + 1) = 2. So, in this case, each coefficient from the first part is multiplied by the sum of coefficients from the second part, which is 2.\n\nIn this example, the sum of coefficients in the second part is 2, which is \\(2^1\\). So, applying the same logic, if the second part is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^n\\), the sum of coefficients is \\(2^n\\). Therefore, in the original problem, the sum of coefficients in the second part is \\(2^6 = 64\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, that makes sense. So, I think my initial approach was correct. Therefore, the coefficient is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is found by considering the expansion of each part separately and then combining the results. \n\n1. **Expanding \\((a + b)^4\\):**  \n   Using the binomial theorem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n\n2. **Considering \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**  \n   The sum of the coefficients in this expansion is \\(2^6 = 64\\).\n\n3. **Combining both parts:**  \n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n**Answer:**  \n\\boxed{384}"

If I expand this using the binomial theorem, the general term will be \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\\) for \\(k = 0\\) to \\(4\\). I'm specifically interested in the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2, which would be when \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). So, plugging in \\(k = 2\\), the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\).\n\nCalculating that, \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\).

Let me think again. Actually, when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum of the products of the coefficients of terms whose exponents add up to that specific term. But in this case, since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\), and \\(1/c\\) are different variables, the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) don't interfere with those of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, no, that's not correct either because each term in the product will have both \\(a^2b^2\\) and some combination of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) times any term involving \\(c\\) would just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times the sum of all coefficients from the other part. But actually, that's not quite right either. Maybe I'm overcomplicating it.\n\nWait, perhaps it's simpler. Since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\), and \\(1/c\\) are all separate variables, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be formed by taking the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from \\((a + b)^4\\) and multiplying it by every possible term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, each of those will contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times some power of \\(c\\). But if we're just looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then yes, it would be the product of the coefficient from the first part and the sum of all coefficients from the second part.\n\nWait, but actually, no. Because when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum of products of coefficients of terms whose exponents add up to that term. But in this case, since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\), and \\(1/c\\) are all different variables, the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) don't interact with those of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that's not exactly correct either because each term in the product will have both \\(a^2b^2\\) and some power of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^k\\) would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^k\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But if the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), without considering \\(c\\), then perhaps it's just 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nWait, but actually, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) will contribute to the product when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), and since we're not considering the power of \\(c\\), we just sum all coefficients from that part.\n\nBut wait, how do we calculate the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)? The sum of all coefficients in a polynomial is found by setting all variables to 1. So, if we set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = (2)^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times 64, which is 384.\n\nWait, but that seems too straightforward. Let me check again. Alternatively, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. It's possible that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), which would mean that we're looking for the total coefficient when considering all possible powers of \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would indeed be 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, giving 384.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning that we're looking for the term where \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). That would be different because then we would have to consider only the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. So, let me clarify: does the problem want the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), or does it specifically want \\(a^2b^2c^0\\)? The problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", so I think it's the former, meaning regardless of the power of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient would be 6 times 64, which is 384.\n\nWait, but let me make sure. If the problem had specified \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then we would have to find the coefficient where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out. But since it's just \\(a^2b^2\\), I think it's the total coefficient across all powers of \\(c\\). So, yes, 6 times 64 is 384.\n\nWait, but another way to think about it is that each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\) with coefficient 6, and each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) has a coefficient, say, \\(C_k\\), where \\(k\\) is the exponent of \\(c\\). So, when we multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each \\(C_k c^{k}\\), the resulting term is \\(6C_k a^2b^2c^k\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the sum over all \\(k\\) of \\(6C_k\\), which is 6 times the sum of all \\(C_k\\), which is 6 times 64, so 384.\n\nAlternatively, if we were looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), we would need to find the term where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out, i.e., \\(c^0\\), which would be the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The constant term occurs when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, which would be when the number of \\(c\\) terms equals the number of \\(1/c\\) terms. In the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, the exponent is \\(6 - 2k\\). Setting this equal to zero gives \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, if the problem had asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), the answer would be 6 times 20, which is 120. But since the problem just asks for \\(a^2b^2\\), I think it's 384.\n\nWait, but maybe I should double-check my initial assumption. Let me read the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) can be multiplied by any power of \\(c\\), so the coefficient would be the sum of all coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) multiplied by 6. Since the sum of coefficients is 64, as I calculated earlier, then 6 times 64 is indeed 384.\n\nBut wait, another way to think about it is that when you have two polynomials multiplied together, the coefficient of a specific term in one polynomial is multiplied by the entire other polynomial. So, in this case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6, and then when you multiply by the second polynomial, each term in the second polynomial is added to the product, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider that the second polynomial, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), when expanded, has terms with various powers of \\(c\\). So, when I multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), each of those terms becomes \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for various \\(k\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the sum of all coefficients from the second polynomial multiplied by 6. So, 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me confirm this by actually computing the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). As I thought earlier, setting \\(c = 1\\) gives the sum of coefficients: \\((1 + 1/1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, yes, that's correct.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but just to be absolutely sure, let me consider a simpler case. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^2 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^1\\). Then, expanding \\((a + b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2\\), and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right) = c + 1/c\\). So, the product would be \\(a^2(c + 1/c) + 2ab(c + 1/c) + b^2(c + 1/c)\\). The coefficient of \\(a^2\\) would be the coefficient from the first part, which is 1, multiplied by the sum of coefficients from the second part, which is \\(1 + 1 = 2\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) in the product would be 1 * 2 = 2. Similarly, the coefficient of \\(ab\\) would be 2 * 2 = 4, and the coefficient of \\(b^2\\) would be 1 * 2 = 2. So, in this case, it works out as expected.\n\nSo, applying the same logic to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it, and the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which would make the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) equal to 6 times each term in the expansion. But that doesn't make sense because the coefficient can't be a polynomial; it has to be a numerical coefficient. Therefore, the only way this makes sense is if we're considering the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) across all possible powers of \\(c\\), which would be the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by 6. So, 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be different. Let me check that possibility as well. If the problem had specified \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then the coefficient would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 20, so 6 * 20 = 120. But since the problem just says \\(a^2b^2\\), I think it's the total across all \\(c\\) terms, which would be 384.\n\nWait, but to make sure, let me think about how the product works. When you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by every term in the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Because each term in the second part contributes to the product when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, the sum of all coefficients in the second part is 64, so the total coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, if we were to collect like terms, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the sum over all possible \\(k\\) of (coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in first part) times (coefficient of \\(c^k\\) in second part). But since we're not considering \\(k\\), we just sum over all \\(k\\), which is the same as multiplying by the sum of all coefficients in the second part.\n\nTherefore, I think the correct answer is 384.\n\nBut just to make sure, let me compute the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) again. As I said, setting \\(c = 1\\) gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\), which is correct. So, the sum is indeed 64.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but I just thought of another way to approach this. Since the two parts are multiplied together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is simply the coefficient from the first part times the entire second part. So, in other words, it's 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, which doesn't make sense. Therefore, I must have made a mistake in that line of thinking. The correct approach is that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all coefficients from the second part, because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second polynomial, each term contributes to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times some power of \\(c\\). Therefore, if we're not considering the power of \\(c\\), we sum all those contributions, which is 6 times 64.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So, the answer is 384.\n\nWait, but let me just confirm with an example. Let's take a simpler case: \\((a + b)^1 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^1\\). Then, \\((a + b)(c + 1/c)\\) expands to \\(a c + a/c + b c + b/c\\). The coefficient of \\(a\\) is \\(c + 1/c\\), and the coefficient of \\(b\\) is also \\(c + 1/c\\). So, if we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a\\), regardless of \\(c\\), it's \\(c + 1/c\\). But if we set \\(c = 1\\), the sum of coefficients is 2, so the coefficient of \\(a\\) would be 2. Similarly, the coefficient of \\(b\\) would be 2. So, in this case, it works out that the coefficient is the coefficient from the first part times the sum of coefficients from the second part.\n\nTherefore, applying that logic to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times 64, which is 384.\n\nSo, after all that thinking, I believe the answer is 384.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{384}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem.\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term \\(a^2b^2\\) occurs when \\(k = 2\\), so the coefficient is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\n   \\]\n\n2. **Consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   The sum of all coefficients in this expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\):\n   \\[\n   \\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\n   \\]\n\n3. **Combine the results:**\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the product of the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) and the sum of all coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 64 = 384\n   \\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{384}."

    "text": " So, maybe I can apply that here.\n\nIn this case, the expression is \\((a + b)^4\\), so \\(n = 4\\). I need to find the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2. That means I need the term where \\(a^2b^2\\). Let me write that down. Using the binomial theorem, the general term is \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\\). I want \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\), right? So, plugging \\(k = 2\\) into the binomial coefficient, I get \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\).\n\nCalculating that, \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. But wait, the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I need to consider how that affects the coefficient.\n\nHmm, so the original expression is a product of two binomials raised to powers. Since I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I need to see if the other part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), contributes anything to the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. But wait, \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) are separate variables from \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), so when I multiply the two expressions together, the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) will be multiplied by terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\).\n\nBut since I'm only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I don't need to worry about the \\(c\\) terms because \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\). So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, that doesn't make sense because when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficients multiply, but in this case, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term is only from the first part, and the second part doesn't affect it because it's multiplied by other terms involving \\(c\\).\n\nWait, no, actually, when you multiply two expressions, each term in the first expression is multiplied by each term in the second expression. So, if I have \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), then the product will have terms like \\(a^2b^2 \\times c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2 \\times 6c^5\\), etc. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). But \\(a^2b^2\\) isn't multiplied by any \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\) terms, so actually, it's just the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part multiplied by the constant term from the second part, which is when the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out.\n\nWait, hold on, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, when you expand this, each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by every term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term without any \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), that would only happen if the term from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is a constant term, i.e., \\(c^0\\).\n\nSo, I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. Then, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\).\n\nSo, first, let me find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\times \\left(1/c\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). I need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be zero, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\).\n\nCalculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20.\n\nNow, going back to the original expression, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the constant term from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). As I found earlier, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 20. So, multiplying these together, 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake here. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6a\u00b2b\u00b2, and the constant term in the second part is 20. So, when you multiply them, you get 6 * 20 a\u00b2b\u00b2 = 120a\u00b2b\u00b2. Therefore, the coefficient is 120.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should think of it as the entire expansion being a product, so the coefficient is 6 * 20, which is indeed 120. Yeah, that makes sense.\n\nWait, but just to be thorough, let me consider if there's any other way this could be approached. Maybe by expanding both parts separately and then looking for the term. But that seems more complicated because expanding both would take a lot of time, especially since the second part has 7 terms. But since we only need the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), it's sufficient to find the constant term in the second part and multiply it by the coefficient from the first part.\n\nSo, I think my approach is correct. The coefficient is 120.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break down the problem into two parts:\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   The term with \\(a^2b^2\\) is given by \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient is 6.\n\n2. **Find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   Using the binomial theorem, the general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\\). Setting the exponent to zero (\\(6 - 2k = 0\\)), we find \\(k = 3\\). The constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n\n3. **Multiply the coefficients:**\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}."

From this, I can see that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. But wait, the problem is asking for the coefficient in the product of two expressions: \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I need to consider how these two parts interact.\n\nLet me denote the first part as \\(A = (a + b)^4\\) and the second part as \\(B = \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The entire expression is \\(A \\times B\\). Since I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I can note that the terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) in \\(B\\) won't affect the powers of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) in \\(A\\). That is, when I multiply \\(A\\) and \\(B\\), each term in \\(A\\) will be multiplied by each term in \\(B\\), but the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) will only come from \\(A\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product will just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(A\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(B\\). But wait, that doesn't sound right because when you multiply two polynomials, each term in \\(A\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(B\\), but since we're looking for a specific term \\(a^2b^2\\), we don't need to consider the \\(c\\) terms because they don't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) exponents.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again. The expression is a product of two separate expressions: one involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the other involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). Since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\), and \\(1/c\\) are different variables, their exponents don't interfere with each other. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But wait, no, that's not quite accurate because when you multiply two expressions, the coefficients of each term in the product are the products of the coefficients from each expression. But in this case, since we're looking for a term that only involves \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and not \\(c\\), the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Wait, that might not be correct either because the terms in \\(B\\) are separate.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think differently. Since the variables in \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) are independent, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\(A \\times B\\) will be obtained by taking \\(a^2b^2\\) from \\(A\\) and any term from \\(B\\). But since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(A\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(B\\). Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in \\(B\\), each term contributes its own coefficient, and since \\(a^2b^2\\) is being multiplied by all terms in \\(B\\), the total coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(A\\) times the sum of the coefficients in \\(B\\).\n\nWait, but that doesn't seem right because when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second, but the variables are separate. So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(A\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(B\\). But since \\(B\\) is multiplied as a whole, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(A\\) times the entire sum of \\(B\\), but that's not quite accurate because \\(B\\) has terms with \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), which don't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) exponents. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is simply the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(A\\) multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients in \\(B\\). Wait, but actually, when you multiply \\(A\\) and \\(B\\), each term in \\(A\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(B\\), but since we're only interested in terms that have \\(a^2b^2\\) and no \\(c\\) terms, we need to consider only the terms in \\(B\\) that result in \\(c^0\\), because \\(c^0 = 1\\), which would allow the \\(a^2b^2\\) term to remain as is without any \\(c\\) factors.\n\nWait, that's a better way to think about it. So, in the product \\(A \\times B\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in \\(B\\). But since we want only the terms where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero (i.e., \\(c^0\\)), because otherwise, the term would have a \\(c\\) factor, which we don't want when considering \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(A\\) multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(B\\). So, first, let me find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(B = \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), I can use the binomial theorem again. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is:\n\n\\[\n\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n\\]\n\nWe need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, so we set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\):\n\n\\[\n6 - 2k = 0 \\\\\n2k = 6 \\\\\nk = 3\n\\]\n\nSo, the term when \\(k = 3\\) is:\n\n\\[\n\\dbinom{6}{3} c^{6 - 2 \\times 3} = \\dbinom{6}{3} c^0 = \\dbinom{6}{3} \\times 1 = 20\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(B\\) is 20.\n\nNow, going back to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(A\\) is 6, as we found earlier, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(B\\) is 20. Therefore, when we multiply \\(A\\) and \\(B\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nWait, let me double-check that. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(A\\) is 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(B\\) is 20. Since we're looking for the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\(A \\times B\\), which is \\(a^2b^2 \\times c^0\\), the coefficient is indeed 6 multiplied by 20, which is 120.\n\nBut just to make sure I didn't make a mistake, let me go through it again. In \\(A = (a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). In \\(B = \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term with \\(c^0\\) is when the exponent from \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) cancel out, which happens at \\(k = 3\\), giving \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, multiplying these together gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). That seems correct.\n\nI think that's the answer. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Multiplying these gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{120}\n\\]"

    "text": " \n\nSo, for \\((a + b)^4\\), the expansion will have terms from \\(a^4\\) down to \\(b^4\\). I specifically need the term that has \\(a^2b^2\\). Let me recall how to find that. The general term in the expansion is \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\\). I want the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2, so that means \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). \n\nCalculating the binomial coefficient for \\(k = 2\\), we get \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). I remember that \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) is 6 because \\(\\dbinom{n}{k} = \\dfrac{n!}{k!(n - k)!}\\), so plugging in the numbers: \\(4! = 24\\), \\(2! = 2\\), so it's \\(24 / (2 * 2) = 24 / 4 = 6\\). So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), is 6. \n\nNow, the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I need to consider how this multiplication affects the coefficient I just found. Since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\), and this is being multiplied by another expansion, I think I need to consider the entire product. \n\nWait, but actually, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is being multiplied by every term in the second expansion. However, since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) don't appear in the second part of the product \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), that means the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression will just be the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the entire second expansion. But wait, no, that's not quite right. \n\nWait, actually, no. Because when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. However, since the second polynomial doesn't have \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part will just be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, but since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), that term's coefficient in the overall product will just be 6 multiplied by the entire second expansion. But that doesn't make sense because the second expansion is a sum of terms with different powers of \\(c\\). \n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But since the problem is only concerned with the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\), the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product will be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that can't be right because the coefficient should be a number, not an expression. \n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), the answer would be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in the second expansion. But that also doesn't make sense because the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion is when \\(c = 1\\), so \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). So, would the coefficient be 6 * 64 = 384? But that seems too high, and I'm not sure if that's the right approach.\n\nWait, no, I think I'm making a mistake here. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product. Since the second part \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), when you multiply it by \\((a + b)^4\\), each term in the second expansion is just a coefficient that scales the corresponding term in the first expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion has a coefficient of 6, and when you multiply it by the entire second expansion, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be 6 multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients in the second expansion. \n\nBut wait, the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion is indeed when \\(c = 1\\), so \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 * 64 = 384. But I'm not entirely confident about this approach because I'm not sure if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms or just the term \\(a^2b^2\\) without considering \\(c\\). \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, which would be 6 multiplied by the entire second expansion, but that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. Therefore, I must have misunderstood the problem. \n\nWait, maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out. Because in the second expansion, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the terms have exponents from \\(c^6\\) down to \\(c^{-6}\\) in steps of 2. So, perhaps the problem is implicitly asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), i.e., the constant term in \\(c\\). \n\nIf that's the case, then I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, first, find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), multiply them together, and that will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product. \n\nThat makes more sense. So, let me proceed with that approach. \n\nFirst, as before, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. \n\nNext, I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). To do this, I can use the binomial theorem again. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). \n\nI need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, so I set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), I get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). \n\nTherefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 * 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). \n\nSo, the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. \n\nNow, since the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, but we're only interested in the constant term in \\(c\\), which is 20, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is 120. \n\nWait, let me double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake. \n\n1. Expanded \\((a + b)^4\\) and found the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. That seems correct because \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n\n2. Expanded \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) and found the constant term by setting the exponent to zero, which gave \\(k = 3\\), so the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). That also seems correct.\n\n3. Multiplied the two coefficients together: 6 * 20 = 120. That makes sense because each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, but since we're only interested in the constant term in \\(c\\), we take the product of the coefficients from each relevant term.\n\nYes, I think that's correct. So, the final answer should be 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Multiplying these gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\boxed{120}."

    "text": " So, maybe I can apply that here.\n\nLet me start by looking at the first part of the expression, which is \\((a + b)^4\\). I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in this part. Using the binomial theorem, the general term in the expansion is \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\\). I want the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2, so that means \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\).

So, the coefficient from the first part is 6.\n\nNow, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Since I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and the second part of the expression involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), which are different variables, I think that when I multiply the two expansions together, the terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) won't affect the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression should just be the same as the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part.\n\nWait, no, that doesn't make sense. Because the second part is multiplied by the first, but I'm only looking for the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) appears. So, actually, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part multiplied by the sum of all terms from the second part. But since the second part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a separate expansion, the terms in it don't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\). So, when I multiply the two expansions, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by every term in the second expansion.\n\nWait, but I'm just looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part, because every term in the second expansion will multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. But that can't be right because that would make the coefficient depend on \\(c\\), which it shouldn't. Wait, no, actually, I think I'm overcomplicating this.\n\nWait, perhaps I should think of it differently. The entire expression is a product of two independent expansions: one in terms of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the other in terms of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, when you multiply them together, each term from the first expansion gets multiplied by each term from the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion will be multiplied by every term from the second expansion, but since the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\), the coefficient would actually be the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the entire sum of the second expansion. But that doesn't make sense because the coefficient should be a number, not a polynomial in \\(c\\).\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, perhaps they are treating \\(c\\) as another variable, and they just want the coefficient of the term that has \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would be the coefficient from the first part, 6, multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part, but since the second part is a sum, the coefficient would actually be 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. But wait, that's not correct because each term in the second expansion has different powers of \\(c\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients in the second expansion. But wait, the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), so let me check that.\n\nWait, no, actually, when you have \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the sum of the coefficients would be when \\(c = 1\\), so substituting \\(c = 1\\), we get \\((1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 * 64 = 384. But that seems high, and I'm not sure if that's the correct approach.\n\nWait, but maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think again. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in the expansion is of the form \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}a^{2}b^{2}\\) multiplied by \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the sum over all \\(m\\) from 0 to 6 of \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\dbinom{6}{m}\\). Wait, no, that can't be right because each term in the product is \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}a^{4 - k}b^{k}\\) times \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\), so to get the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), we need \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\), so the coefficient from the first part is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\), and then for each term in the second expansion, it's \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\), but since we're multiplying the entire second expansion by \\(a^2b^2\\), the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, as I thought earlier. So, 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but that seems too large. Let me check with a simpler example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^1 (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, expanding, we have \\((a + b)(c + 1/c)\\). The coefficient of \\(a^1b^0\\) would be 1 (from the first part) multiplied by the sum of coefficients in the second part, which is \\((1 + 1) = 2\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^1b^0\\) would be 2, which makes sense because the terms are \\(a c\\), \\(a/c\\), \\(b c\\), \\(b/c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a\\) is 2, as expected. Similarly, the coefficient of \\(a^0b^1\\) is also 2. So, in that case, the approach works.\n\nSo, applying that logic, in our problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by the sum of the coefficients in the second part, which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. Therefore, the coefficient is 384.\n\nWait, but let me think again. The second part is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which expands to terms with different powers of \\(c\\). So, when we multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), each term in the second expansion will be multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), etc. But the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, in other words, we're looking for all terms in the product that have \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of what power of \\(c\\) they have. So, the coefficient would indeed be the coefficient from the first part, 6, multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part, which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me check another way. Let's consider the entire expression as a product of two polynomials. The first polynomial is in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the second is in \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, when you multiply them, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first polynomial is multiplied by every term in the second polynomial, which is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial. The sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), so \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but another way to think about it is that since the second part is a separate expansion, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is just the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the entire second expansion, but since we're only interested in the coefficient, not the entire term, it's 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider that the second part is a generating function, and when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients of all terms in the second expansion, which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me check if that's correct by looking at a smaller example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^1 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). The expansion is \\((a + b)(c + 1/c)\\). The coefficient of \\(a^1b^0\\) is 1 (from the first part) times the sum of coefficients in the second part, which is 2 (since \\(c + 1/c\\) evaluated at \\(c=1\\) is 2). So, the coefficient of \\(a^1b^0\\) is 2, which is correct because the terms are \\(a c\\), \\(a/c\\), etc. Similarly, the coefficient of \\(a^0b^1\\) is also 2. So, this approach works.\n\nTherefore, applying this to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 (from the first part) times 64 (sum of coefficients in the second part), which is 384.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Maybe I'm making a mistake here. Because the second part is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is a Laurent polynomial, meaning it can have negative exponents. So, when we multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), etc. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in other words, we're looking for all the terms where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2 and 2, respectively, and we're summing their coefficients across all possible powers of \\(c\\).\n\nSo, in that case, the coefficient would indeed be the coefficient from the first part, 6, multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which is 64, giving 384.\n\nWait, but another way to think about it is that the entire expression is a product of two independent expansions, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Since the second part is a Laurent polynomial, the sum of its coefficients is found by substituting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider that since the second part doesn't affect the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire second expansion. But since we're only interested in the coefficient, not the actual term, it's 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not missing anything. Let me try to compute it another way. Let's expand both parts separately and then see what happens when we multiply them.\n\nFirst, expand \\((a + b)^4\\). The expansion is:\n\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\n\\]\n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6.\n\nNow, expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem, this is:\n\n\\[\n\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n\\]\n\nSo, the expansion is:\n\n\\[\nc^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15c^{-2} + 6c^{-4} + c^{-6}\n\\]\n\nSo, the sum of all coefficients is when \\(c = 1\\), which is \\(1 + 6 + 15 + 20 + 15 + 6 + 1 = 64\\), as I thought earlier.\n\nNow, when I multiply the two expansions together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be 6 multiplied by each coefficient in the second expansion. But since we're summing over all terms, the total coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but that seems correct because each term in the second expansion is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), so the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion.\n\nAlternatively, if I were to collect like terms, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 multiplied by each term in the second expansion, but since we're just looking for the coefficient regardless of the power of \\(c\\), it's 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, giving 384.\n\nWait, but let me think about it another way. Suppose I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = (1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, the entire expression becomes \\((a + b)^4 * 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nYes, that makes sense because when \\(c = 1\\), all the terms in the second expansion become 1, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just 6 * 64.\n\nTherefore, I think the correct answer is 384.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break down the problem into two parts:\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\):** Using the binomial theorem, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is found when the exponent of \\(a\\) is 2 and the exponent of \\(b\\) is 2.

So, I think I should first expand each part separately and then see how they multiply together. But since I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), maybe I don't need to expand the entire expression. Let me think.\n\nSo, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\). Let me first find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\). Using the binomial theorem, the general term is \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\\). I need the term where \\(a^2b^2\\), so that's when \\(4 - k = 2\\), which means \\(k = 2\\). So the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\\).

Wait, but actually, when you multiply two expressions, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second.

Using the binomial theorem again, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). The exponent on \\(c\\) will be zero when \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), so \\(2k = 6\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\). So the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n\nSo, the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Therefore, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by 20 from the second part. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the second part), which is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nWait, let me double-check that. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is indeed 6, and the constant term in the other expansion is 20, so when I multiply the two expressions, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by 20, giving me a total coefficient of 120. That seems right.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of the entire expression as \\((a + b)^4\\) times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when expanding, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Since I'm only interested in the term that has \\(a^2b^2\\), which comes from \\((a + b)^4\\), and the constant term from the other expansion, which is 20, so yes, 6 times 20 is 120.\n\nI don't think I made any mistakes here. The key was recognizing that to get the term \\(a^2b^2\\), I needed the coefficient from the first expansion and the constant term from the second expansion. Multiplying them together gives the final coefficient. So, the coefficient should be 120.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break the problem into two parts:\n\n1. **Find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\):**\n   Using the binomial theorem, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\) in the expansion, so the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n\n2. **Find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   The constant term occurs when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. This happens when \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), giving \\(k = 3\\). The coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n\nMultiplying these coefficients together gives the final coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product:\n\n\\[\n6 \\times 20 = 120\n\\]\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}."

    "text": " So, in this case, for \\((a + b)^4\\), the expansion would be the sum from \\(k = 0\\) to \\(4\\) of \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\\).\n\nNow, I'm specifically looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). That means I need to find the term where the exponent of \\(a\\) is 2 and the exponent of \\(b\\) is 2. Let me see, in the binomial expansion, each term is \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\\). So, if I set \\(4 - k = 2\\), that would mean \\(k = 2\\). So, the term for \\(k=2\\) would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} a^{2}b^{2}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) is 6, so the coefficient here is 6.\n\nWait, but the problem isn't just \\((a + b)^4\\), it's multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I need to consider both expansions together. Hmm, but I'm only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). That means I don't need to worry about the terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), right? Because \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\). So, when I multiply the two expressions, the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) will multiply with the terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), but since I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), the part involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) can be treated separately and then multiplied together.\n\nWait, no. Actually, when you multiply two expressions, each term from the first expression multiplies each term from the second expression. But since I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I can consider the part of the product that contributes to \\(a^2b^2\\). That is, from \\((a + b)^4\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) has a coefficient of 6, as I found earlier. Then, from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), I need to find the term that's multiplied by this \\(a^2b^2\\) term. But wait, actually, no, because when you multiply two polynomials, each term from the first is multiplied by each term from the second. So, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first part will be multiplied by every term in the second part. But since I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, I need to see if there's any overlap where the second expression contributes to \\(a^2b^2\\). But wait, the second expression is in terms of \\(c\\), so it doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\). Therefore, the only term that contributes to \\(a^2b^2\\) is the term from the first expression, and the second expression just multiplies it by whatever it is.\n\nWait, that doesn't make sense. Let me think again. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when you expand this, each term from \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are different variables, the product of an \\(a^2b^2\\) term and a \\(c^k\\) term would be \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), which is a different term. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, no, that's not quite right either.\n\nWait, no. Actually, when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second, and then you add up the coefficients for like terms. But in this case, since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are different variables, the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from those involving \\(c\\). So, the only way to get a term with \\(a^2b^2\\) is to take the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from \\((a + b)^4\\) and multiply it by the constant term (if any) from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, is that correct? Let me think.\n\nWait, no. The constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) would be the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. So, let me find that. Using the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\).\n\nSo, the exponent of \\(c\\) in each term is \\(6 - 2m\\). To find the constant term, we set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which gives \\(m = 3\\). So, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} c^{0} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20.\n\nTherefore, when we multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by the constant term 20 from the second part. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the second part), which is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not missing anything. Is there any other term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) that could contribute to the \\(a^2b^2\\) term when multiplied by \\((a + b)^4\\)? Well, since \\(c\\) and \\(a\\), \\(b\\) are different variables, the only way a term from the second expression could affect the \\(a^2b^2\\) term is if the second expression had a term with \\(c^0\\), which is the constant term. Any other term would have a positive or negative exponent of \\(c\\), which would make the product have \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) where \\(k\\) is non-zero, which isn't \\(a^2b^2\\). So, only the constant term contributes.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient is indeed 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations. The coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the constant term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. So, 6 * 20 is 120. That seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, another way to think about it is that when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each polynomial, provided that the variables match in a way that their exponents add up to the desired term. In this case, since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) is to multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first polynomial by the constant term from the second polynomial. So, yes, 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nI think that makes sense. So, the coefficient is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, using the binomial theorem. Then, we find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20. Multiplying these together gives 6 * 20 = 120.\n\n\\boxed{120}"

    "text": " So, maybe I can apply that here.\n\nAlright, let's start with the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\). Using the binomial theorem, this should expand to \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\\). I need the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so I should look for the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2. That means I need \\(4 - k = 2\\) for \\(a\\) and \\(k = 2\\) for \\(b\\). Solving \\(4 - k = 2\\) gives \\(k = 2\\). So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\).\n\nLet me compute that. \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6. Got that down.\n\nNow, the expression also has the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I need to consider this as well. Wait, but the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which only involves \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). The \\(c\\) terms are separate, right? So, does that mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't depend on the \\(c\\) terms? Or do I need to consider something else?\n\nHmm, maybe I need to think about how the two parts multiply together. The entire expression is the product of \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when I multiply these two expansions together, each term from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term from the second expansion. But since I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I can ignore the \\(c\\) terms because they won't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. Wait, is that correct?\n\nLet me clarify. When I expand both parts, each term in the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, if I have \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part, it will be multiplied by every term from the second part. But the problem is asking just for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which implies that we're considering the entire expression as a product, and we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. But that might not be the case because \\(a^2b^2\\) is part of the product, and the \\(c\\) terms might influence the overall expression.\n\nWait, no. Let me think again. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term in the expansion. But in the product, \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term from the second expansion. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all terms in the second part. But wait, that can't be right because the second part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a separate variable.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me parse the problem again. It says: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, the expression is a product of two separate binomial expansions. When you multiply them, each term from the first expansion is multiplied by each term from the second expansion. But the term \\(a^2b^2\\) can only come from the first expansion, right? Because the second expansion only has \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) terms. So, when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by any term from the second expansion, you'll get terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2 \\cdot c^{-k}\\), but the pure \\(a^2b^2\\) term would only be when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by 1, which is the constant term in the second expansion.\n\nWait, that makes sense. So, to get the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because when I multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by the constant term, I get \\(a^2b^2\\) times that constant, which contributes to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product.\n\nSo, first, as I found earlier, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. Now, I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me figure that out.\n\nThe expression \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) can be expanded using the binomial theorem as \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k\\). Simplifying each term, that becomes \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k - k} = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\).\n\nI need the constant term, which is the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. So, I set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\).\n\nCalculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the product of the two coefficients we found: 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (the constant term from the second part). So, 6 times 20 is 120.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion is 6, and the constant term in the second expansion is 20. So, when you multiply these two parts together, each term from the first part is multiplied by each term from the second part. The \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first part is multiplied by the constant term 20 from the second part, giving \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\) as the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product.\n\nIs there any other way this could be interpreted? Let me think. Suppose someone thought that the \\(c\\) terms could somehow affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms, but I don't think so because \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are different variables. So, when you multiply the two expansions, the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms are independent of the \\(c\\) terms. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 120.\n\nWait, just to double-check, let me consider the entire product. The first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), has terms up to \\(a^4b^0\\) and \\(a^0b^4\\), while the second part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), has terms with various powers of \\(c\\). When I multiply them, the only way to get a term with \\(a^2b^2\\) is to take the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part and multiply it by the constant term (i.e., \\(c^0\\)) from the second part. Any other term from the second part would introduce a power of \\(c\\), which would change the term to something like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2c^{-k}\\), which are different from \\(a^2b^2\\). So, yes, only the constant term from the second part contributes to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product.\n\nTherefore, I can be confident that the coefficient is 6 multiplied by 20, which is 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem.\n\nFirst, consider the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n\\]\nWe need the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). This occurs when \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). The coefficient is:\n\\[\n\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\n\\]\n\nNext, consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem:\n\\[\n\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n\\]\nWe need the constant term, which occurs when \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\) gives \\(k = 3\\). The constant term is:\n\\[\n\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\n\\]\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the product of the coefficients from the two expansions:\n\\[\n6 \\times 20 = 120\n\\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."
