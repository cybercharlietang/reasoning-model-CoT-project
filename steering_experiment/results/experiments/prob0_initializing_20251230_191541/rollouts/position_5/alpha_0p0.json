    "text": " Let me write that out using the binomial theorem.\n\nSo, \\((a + b)^4 = \\dbinom{4}{0}a^4b^0 + \\dbinom{4}{1}a^3b^1 + \\dbinom{4}{2}a^2b^2 + \\dbinom{4}{3}a^1b^3 + \\dbinom{4}{4}a^0b^4\\). Calculating the coefficients, that would be \\(1a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + 1b^4\\). Okay, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in this expansion is 6. But wait, the original problem is \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), so I need to consider the entire expression, not just \\((a + b)^4\\).\n\nHmm, so I think the idea is that I have to multiply these two expansions together. But I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that comes from the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\). The second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), involves variables \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), which are different from \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). So, when I multiply the two expansions, the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) will only come from the first part, and the terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) will come from the second part. Therefore, when I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I don't need to worry about the \\(c\\) terms because they won't affect the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. Instead, the coefficient will just be the product of the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) and the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but since we're only interested in \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient will just be the coefficient from the first part multiplied by 1, because the second part's expansion doesn't contribute any factors to the \\(a^2b^2\\) term.\n\nWait, no, that doesn't sound right. Let me think again. Actually, when you multiply two polynomials together, each term from the first polynomial is multiplied by each term from the second polynomial. So, for the term \\(a^2b^2\\), which comes from the first part, it would be multiplied by every term from the second part, which is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is to take \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part and multiply it by the constant term (the term with \\(c^0\\)) from the second part. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nOkay, that makes sense. So, I need to find two things: the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which I already found to be 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me work on finding the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in that expression.\n\nAgain, using the binomial theorem for \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which would be \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k\\). Simplifying that, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} c^{-k} = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, the exponent of \\(c\\) in each term is \\(6 - 2k\\). I need to find the value of \\(k\\) for which this exponent is 0 because I'm looking for the constant term.\n\nSo, set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the term where \\(k = 3\\) will be the constant term. The coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20.\n\nNow, putting it all together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is the product of the coefficient from the first part and the coefficient from the second part. That would be \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake here. So, the first part's coefficient is 6, and the second part's constant term is 20. Multiplying them together gives 120. That seems correct. Let me double-check my calculations.\n\nFor \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). For \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the constant term occurs when the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, which happens at \\(k = 3\\), and \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, multiplying 6 and 20 gives 120. Yeah, that seems right.\n\nI think I might have confused myself earlier by thinking that the second part's expansion wouldn't contribute, but actually, it does contribute a factor that affects the overall coefficient. So, the final answer should be 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The constant term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Multiplying these together gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\boxed{120}"

    "text": " Let me expand that first.\n\nExpanding \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem, I get:\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\dbinom{4}{0}a^4b^0 + \\dbinom{4}{1}a^3b^1 + \\dbinom{4}{2}a^2b^2 + \\dbinom{4}{3}a^1b^3 + \\dbinom{4}{4}a^0b^4\n\\]\nCalculating each binomial coefficient:\n- \\(\\dbinom{4}{0} = 1\\)\n- \\(\\dbinom{4}{1} = 4\\)\n- \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\)\n- \\(\\dbinom{4}{3} = 4\\)\n- \\(\\dbinom{4}{4} = 1\\)\n\nSo, expanding, we have:\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\n\\]\nAlright, so the term with \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(6a^2b^2\\). Now, the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the next part is to figure out how this multiplication affects the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). \n\nWait, but actually, the question is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not considering the \\(c\\) terms. Hmm, let me think. When you multiply two expressions, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression. So, in this case, each term from \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nBut the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, in the product, \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by every term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). However, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product will just be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, that might not be correct because the question is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). \n\nWait, hold on. Let me re-read the problem: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, actually, the question is treating the entire expression as a polynomial in \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\), and \\(1/c\\), and it's asking for the coefficient of the term \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, in other words, we're looking for all the terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by some power of \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), but we just need the coefficient for the \\(a^2b^2\\) part. \n\nSo, in that case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because when you multiply \\(6a^2b^2\\) by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the coefficient for each \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) term would be \\(6\\) times the corresponding coefficient from the \\(c\\) terms. But since the question is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, the coefficient would actually just be \\(6\\) times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that doesn't make sense because each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) has different powers of \\(c\\), so when multiplied by \\(6a^2b^2\\), each would contribute a different term. \n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Maybe the question is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, but since \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) are separate, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be \\(6\\) times the sum of the coefficients of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, that's not correct because the sum of the coefficients of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) would be obtained by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\(2^6 = 64\\). So, then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). But I'm not sure if that's the right approach.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm supposed to treat the entire expression as a product and find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without considering \\(c\\). But that doesn't make sense because \\(c\\) is another variable. Wait, perhaps the problem is actually to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where \\(c\\) cancels out, but the problem doesn't specify that. It just says \\(a^2b^2\\). Hmm.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider that when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each polynomial. But in this case, \\((a + b)^4\\) is a polynomial in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is a polynomial in \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, when you multiply them, the terms will be products of terms from each polynomial. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is actually a sum over all terms from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each multiplied by 6. But that can't be right because each term would have different powers of \\(c\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually be a polynomial in \\(c\\). \n\nWait, perhaps the question is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, so effectively, the coefficient would be \\(6\\) times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because when you multiply \\(6a^2b^2\\) by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term contributes a multiple of \\(a^2b^2\\), and the coefficients add up. So, the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is obtained by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). \n\nBut let me check this reasoning. If I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the entire expression becomes \\((a + b)^4 \\times 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in this case would be \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). So, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should approach it differently. Let's think about the entire product as a product of two polynomials: one in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and another in \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). When you multiply them, the terms are independent, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since the question is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, it's essentially asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times the sum of all coefficients in the \\(c\\) part. \n\nWait, but that's the same as setting \\(c = 1\\) in the \\(c\\) part, which gives us the sum of the coefficients as 64, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) becomes \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). That seems to make sense.\n\nAlternatively, if I were to consider the entire expansion, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by each term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), so the coefficient would be \\(6\\) times the sum of the coefficients of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is indeed 64, leading to 384.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not missing anything. Let me try another approach. Suppose I consider the entire expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). If I want the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I can treat the \\(c\\) terms as separate. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean that the coefficient is \\(6\\) times the sum of all the coefficients in the \\(c\\) expansion, which is 64, so 6*64=384.\n\nAlternatively, if I were to collect like terms, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would indeed be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in the \\(c\\) part, which is 64, so 384.\n\nWait, but let me think again. The problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, in the product, every term will be of the form \\(a^k b^{4 - k} c^m\\) or something like that. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the sum over all \\(m\\) of the coefficients from the \\(c\\) part multiplied by 6. So, yes, that would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the \\(c\\) part, which is 64, so 384.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Let me try to compute it differently. Let's compute the product step by step. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which can be expanded as \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). \n\nSo, the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). Therefore, when we multiply this by \\(6a^2b^2\\), we get \\(6a^2b^2 \\times \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\), which is equal to \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} 6 \\dbinom{6}{k} a^2b^2 c^{6 - 2k}\\). \n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the sum of all the coefficients from the \\(c\\) part multiplied by 6. But wait, no, actually, each term is \\(6 \\dbinom{6}{k} a^2b^2 c^{6 - 2k}\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(6 \\times \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k}\\). But \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} = 2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\nSo, that seems to confirm my earlier conclusion. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is 384.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the reasoning. Another way to think about it is to consider that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since the question is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, the coefficient would be the product of 6 and the sum of all coefficients in the \\(c\\) expansion, which is 64, giving 384.\n\nAlternatively, if I were to expand both parts and multiply, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would indeed be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the \\(c\\) part, which is 64, so 384.\n\nWait, but let me think differently. Suppose I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the entire expression becomes \\((a + b)^4 \\times 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times 64, which is 384. That seems consistent.\n\nAlternatively, if I didn't set \\(c = 1\\), but instead considered that each term in the product would have different powers of \\(c\\), but since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\), the coefficient would be the sum of all coefficients from the \\(c\\) part multiplied by 6. Which again gives 384.\n\nWait, but perhaps the problem is expecting a different approach. Let me try expanding \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) first. Using the binomial theorem, we have:\n\\[\n\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n\\]\nSo, the expansion is:\n\\[\nc^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15 \\dfrac{1}{c^2} + 6 \\dfrac{1}{c^4} + \\dfrac{1}{c^6}\n\\]\nSo, the coefficients are 1, 6, 15, 20, 15, 6, 1 for the powers \\(c^6, c^4, c^2, c^0, c^{-2}, c^{-4}, c^{-6}\\) respectively.\n\nNow, when we multiply this by \\((a + b)^4\\), which has terms up to \\(a^4\\) and \\(b^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. So, when we multiply \\(6a^2b^2\\) by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term will contribute to the product as follows:\n- \\(6a^2b^2 \\times c^6 = 6a^2b^2c^6\\)\n- \\(6a^2b^2 \\times 6c^4 = 36a^2b^2c^4\\)\n- \\(6a^2b^2 \\times 15c^2 = 90a^2b^2c^2\\)\n- \\(6a^2b^2 \\times 20 = 120a^2b^2\\)\n- \\(6a^2b^2 \\times 15 \\dfrac{1}{c^2} = 90a^2b^2 \\dfrac{1}{c^2}\\)\n- \\(6a^2b^2 \\times 6 \\dfrac{1}{c^4} = 36a^2b^2 \\dfrac{1}{c^4}\\)\n- \\(6a^2b^2 \\times \\dfrac{1}{c^6} = 6a^2b^2 \\dfrac{1}{c^6}\\)\n\nSo, in the entire product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is present in each of these terms, multiplied by different powers of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the sum of all the coefficients from the \\(c\\) part multiplied by 6. So, that would be:\n\\[\n6 \\times (1 + 6 + 15 + 20 + 15 + 6 + 1) = 6 \\times 64 = 384\n\\]\nSo, that confirms it again. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 384.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not missing anything. Is there a possibility that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero? That would be the middle term, which is 20. So, in that case, the coefficient would be \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). But the problem didn't specify \\(c^0\\), it just said \\(a^2b^2\\). So, I think the correct interpretation is that it's asking for the coefficient regardless of the power of \\(c\\), so the sum over all coefficients from the \\(c\\) part, which gives 384.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem had asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it would be 120. But since it's just \\(a^2b^2\\), I think it's 384.\n\nWait, let me check the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, it's just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, in the product, \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term from the \\(c\\) expansion, so the coefficient is the sum of all the coefficients from the \\(c\\) expansion multiplied by 6. Therefore, 6 times 64 is 384.\n\nYes, I think that's correct. So, the final answer is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6. Then, considering the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the sum of its coefficients is \\(2^6 = 64\\). Multiplying these together gives \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\boxed{384}."

But the problem isn't just asking for that; it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, which also includes \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nWait, so does that mean that \\(a^2b^2\\) is part of the product of both expansions? Let me think. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when I multiply these two expressions together, each term in the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. \n\nBut the problem is specifically asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). That means we only care about the terms where the variables \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are squared, and we don't care about the \\(c\\) terms because they are separate. So, actually, the \\(c\\) terms won't affect the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. Is that right? Because when you multiply, the variables multiply as well, so any term from the second expansion that has \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\) will multiply with the \\(a^2b^2\\) term, but since we're only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), those \\(c\\) terms would change the variables, making it something like \\(a^2b^2c\\) or \\(a^2b^2 \\cdot 1/c\\). Therefore, those won't contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) alone.\n\nWait, so does that mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6? Because when you multiply by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), you're adding more terms, but none of them will affect the \\(a^2b^2\\) term unless they are constants. Hmm, but the second part isn't a constant; it's another binomial expansion. So, maybe I'm wrong.\n\nWait, let me think again. If I have \\((a + b)^4\\) times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), then the entire expression is a product of two separate expansions. So, when I multiply them, each term in the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term from the second expansion. But since we are looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), we need to find all the terms in the product where the variables are exactly \\(a^2b^2\\), which means that the terms from the second expansion must be constants, i.e., they must not have any \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\) terms. Because if they have \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), then the variables will be multiplied, and we'll have terms like \\(a^2b^2c\\) or \\(a^2b^2 \\cdot 1/c\\), which are different from \\(a^2b^2\\). So, only the constant term from the second expansion will multiply with the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first expansion, contributing to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression.\n\nSo, that means I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Because when I multiply that constant term by \\(a^2b^2\\), it will just add to the coefficient. So, let me calculate the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\).\n\nAgain, using the binomial theorem, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) can be expanded as:\n\\[\n\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n\\]\nSo, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, because that's the constant term. So, set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), solve for \\(k\\):\n\\[\n6 - 2k = 0 \\\\\n2k = 6 \\\\\nk = 3\n\\]\nSo, the constant term is when \\(k = 3\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} c^{0} = \\dbinom{6}{3} \\times 1 = 20\\). \n\nSo, the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 20. Therefore, when we multiply this by the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first expansion, which has a coefficient of 6, the total coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nWait, but hold on a second. Is that the only contribution? Because in the first expansion, \\((a + b)^4\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by all terms in the second expansion, but only the constant term from the second expansion will contribute to \\(a^2b^2\\). All other terms from the second expansion will result in terms with \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), which won't affect the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. So, yes, only the constant term from the second expansion matters here.\n\nLet me double-check my calculations. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is indeed 6. The constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is when \\(k = 3\\), which gives \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, multiplying them together, 6 * 20 = 120. That seems correct.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't miss anything. Is there a possibility that other terms from the second expansion could somehow result in a term with \\(a^2b^2\\) when multiplied by terms from the first expansion? For example, suppose I have a term from the first expansion that's \\(a^3b\\) and a term from the second expansion that's \\(c^{-1}\\). Then, multiplying them would give \\(a^3b \\cdot c^{-1}\\), which is not \\(a^2b^2\\). Similarly, if I have a term \\(a^4\\) from the first expansion and multiply it by a term \\(c^{-2}\\) from the second expansion, that would give \\(a^4c^{-2}\\), which is not \\(a^2b^2\\). So, in fact, the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is by multiplying the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first expansion by the constant term from the second expansion. So, that's the only contribution.\n\nTherefore, I think my answer is correct. The coefficient is 120.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let me think about the entire expansion. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). When we multiply these two, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), \\(a^2b^2c^2\\), \\(a^2b^2\\), \\(a^2b^2 \\cdot 1/c^2\\), etc. So, all of these terms except the one where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero will have \\(c\\) terms, which are different from \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, only the term where the second factor is 1 (the constant term) will result in a term with \\(a^2b^2\\), and that term's coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nSo, I think that's the correct answer. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning. I considered the binomial expansions, found the necessary coefficients, and confirmed that only the constant term from the second expansion contributes to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break down the problem into two parts: expanding \\((a + b)^4\\) and finding the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\n1. **Expanding \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is found when \\(k = 2\\):\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\n   \\]\n\n2. **Finding the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n   \\]\n   The constant term occurs when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero:\n   \\[\n   6 - 2k = 0 \\implies k = 3\n   \\]\n   The constant term is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\n   \\]\n\n3. **Combining the results:**\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) and the constant term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 20 = 120\n   \\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

    "text": " Let me try expanding that.\n\nAlright, for \\((a + b)^4\\), the expansion will be \\(\\dbinom{4}{0}a^4b^0 + \\dbinom{4}{1}a^3b^1 + \\dbinom{4}{2}a^2b^2 + \\dbinom{4}{3}a^1b^3 + \\dbinom{4}{4}a^0b^4\\). Calculating the coefficients, that's \\(1a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + 1b^4\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in this part is 6.\n\nBut wait, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I think I need to consider the entire product. However, the question is only asking about the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Hmm, so maybe I don't need to worry about the \\(c\\) terms when looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Let me think.\n\nSince \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), when I multiply the two expressions together, the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) will be multiplied by the terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). But since the question is only about \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), maybe I just need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and then multiply it by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that doesn't make sense because the product would have terms with both \\(a, b, c\\).\n\nWait, no, actually, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because when you multiply by 1 (the sum of all coefficients is found by plugging in \\(c = 1\\)), but actually, that's not exactly right because each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is multiplied by each term in \\((a + b)^4\\). But since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, you get terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) and \\(a^2b^2(1/c)^k\\), but the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) alone would require that the \\(c\\) terms cancel out, which only happens if \\(k = 0\\), but wait, no, that's not necessarily the case.\n\nWait, maybe I'm confusing something. Let me try again. The question is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), you get a product where each term is of the form \\(\\text{(term from first expansion)} \\times \\text{(term from second expansion)}\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, but the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would include all the coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion. Wait, no, that doesn't make sense because each multiplication would create terms with different powers of \\(c\\). So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would give a term that's \\(6 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the original problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\). So, maybe the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\).\n\nWait, but the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) equal to 6 * 64 = 384? Hmm, but that seems too straightforward. Let me check again.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question. Maybe it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, which would include terms with \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). But in that case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually be a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. So, perhaps the question is only considering the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms, meaning that we need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), because only then would the term be purely \\(a^2b^2\\). That makes more sense.\n\nSo, in that case, I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). That would involve finding the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and then the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part, which is the constant term of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Then, multiply these two coefficients together to get the final coefficient.\n\nOkay, so first, as established, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. Now, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Let me expand that using the binomial theorem as well.\n\nThe expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(1/c\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so we set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\), which is 20.\n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 20. Now, multiplying this by the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, we get 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but let me double-check that. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part is 20. When you multiply these two expressions together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by the constant term from the second part, which is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is indeed 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 120.\n\nWait, just to make sure I didn't make a mistake, let me go through the steps again.\n\n1. Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem: the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n\n2. Expand \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem: the general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, which happens when \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), so \\(k = 3\\). The coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n\n3. Multiply these two coefficients together: 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nYes, that seems correct. I don't think I made any calculation errors. So, the final answer should be 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Multiplying these gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\boxed{120}"

    "text": " Let me think about expanding that part first.\n\nSo, for \\((a + b)^4\\), the expansion would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{0}a^4b^0 + \\dbinom{4}{1}a^3b^1 + \\dbinom{4}{2}a^2b^2 + \\dbinom{4}{3}a^1b^3 + \\dbinom{4}{4}a^0b^4\\). I need the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is the term where the powers of a and b are both 2. Looking at the expansion, that's the third term, right? So, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). I remember that \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) is calculated as \\(\\dfrac{4!}{2!2!}\\), which is \\(\\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), is 6.\n\nNow, the problem is asking for the coefficient in the entire expression, which is \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I think that since the two parts are multiplied together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be the same as the coefficient in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, no, that's not quite right. Let me think again.\n\nActually, when you multiply two expressions together, the terms combine. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will multiply with every term from the second part. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and the second expression doesn't involve a or b, the coefficient from the first part will just carry over, and the coefficient from the second part will be 1, because any term multiplied by 1 doesn't change its coefficient. Wait, no, that doesn't sound right either.\n\nWait, actually, the second part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which expands to terms involving powers of c and 1/c. So, when we multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of c, the coefficient will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire second part's expansion. But wait, that can't be right because the second part's expansion has many terms. So, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem.\n\nWait, no, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Let me read the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, the expression is a product of two binomials, each raised to a power. The first part is in terms of a and b, and the second part is in terms of c and 1/c. So, when you multiply them together, the resulting expression will have terms that are products of terms from each part. So, for example, a term from the first part like \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term from the second part, which are terms like \\(c^6\\), \\(6c^4\\), \\(15c^2\\), \\(20c^0\\), \\(15c^{-2}\\), \\(6c^{-4}\\), \\(c^{-6}\\), but since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the c terms, I think the coefficient will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part.\n\nWait, but that's not correct because when you multiply, each term from the first part is multiplied by each term from the second part. But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so any term from the second part would just be a constant factor. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. But that seems too large, and I don't think that's what the problem is asking.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me check again. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term in the product of the two expressions. Since the two expressions are multiplied together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second part, which are terms involving c. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would actually be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the sum of all coefficients in the second part, because each term in the second part is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the sum of the coefficients of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nBut wait, the sum of the coefficients in a polynomial is found by setting all variables to 1. So, if I set c = 1, then \\(\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = (2)^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but that seems high. Let me double-check. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the c terms, so that the coefficient is just 6, and the rest of the expression is multiplied by other terms. But that doesn't seem right because the problem is written as a single expression, so the coefficient would include the entire second part.\n\nWait, no, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think again. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When we multiply these two, each term from \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second part, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), etc. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve c. Wait, but in the product, all terms will involve some combination of a, b, and c. So, actually, there is no term with just \\(a^2b^2\\) without any c terms. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be zero because there's no such term. But that can't be right because when you multiply, you can have terms where the c parts cancel out. Wait, but \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\) would be \\(a^2b^2\\), so perhaps the coefficient is 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nOh, that makes more sense. So, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is the constant term, and then multiply that by 6.\n\nSo, let's find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\).\n\nWe need the term where the exponent of c is zero, so we set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for k, we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 * 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\).\n\nSo, the constant term in the second part is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake. So, the first part gives me 6 for \\(a^2b^2\\), and the second part, when expanded, has a constant term of 20. So, when I multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by the constant term 20, I get \\(20a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 20 * 6 = 120? Wait, no, that's not quite right. Wait, the coefficient from the first part is 6, and the coefficient from the second part's constant term is 20, so when you multiply the two expressions, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but let me think again. So, \\((a + b)^4\\) has a term \\(6a^2b^2\\), and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) has a term \\(20c^0\\). So, when you multiply these two, you get \\(6a^2b^2 * 20 = 120a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient is indeed 120.\n\nWait, but let me check if I considered all possible terms. For example, could there be other terms in the product that result in \\(a^2b^2\\) when multiplied by some c terms? But no, because \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term without c, so the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is to multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part by \\(c^0\\) from the second part. Any other term would involve c to some power, so they wouldn't contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) alone. Therefore, the coefficient is indeed 120.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because earlier I thought the coefficient would be 6 * 64 = 384, but that was when I considered the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which is 64. But that's incorrect because the problem is specifically asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times all the c terms. So, the correct approach is to find the constant term in the second part and multiply it by the coefficient from the first part.\n\nSo, to recap: the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nI think that makes sense.

    "text": " Let me write that out using the binomial theorem. That would be \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\\). Now, I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, I'm looking for the term where \\(a\\) is squared and \\(b\\) is squared. That would happen when \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\), right? Because if \\(4 - k = 2\\), then \\(k = 2\\). So, the coefficient for that term would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Let me calculate that. \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) is \\(\\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), is 6. But wait, the problem is asking for the coefficient in the entire expression, which is \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Hmm, so I think I need to consider the expansion of both parts. But wait, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) only involves \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the second part of the product involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, maybe the two parts are independent? Let me think. When you multiply two expressions together, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since the question is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\), does that mean I just need to consider the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and then multiply it by the entire expansion of the second part? Wait, no, that doesn't seem right. Because when you multiply, each term from the first expansion gets multiplied by each term from the second. So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), it would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part, because any term involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) would just tag along. Wait, but that can't be right because then the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which doesn't make sense because the question is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not considering any \\(c\\) terms. Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, perhaps it's just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, and since the second part doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), it's just 6 times the entire expansion of the second part. But that would mean the coefficient is 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which would make the coefficient a polynomial in \\(c\\), not a constant. But that seems odd. Wait, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, in other words, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but that doesn't seem right either. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, considering all possible terms. But since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are only in the first part, the \\(c\\) terms in the second part don't affect the powers of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would just be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but that seems too broad. Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). When you expand this, each term will be of the form \\(a^kb^{4 - k} \\times c^m \\times (1/c)^{6 - m}\\), which simplifies to \\(a^kb^{4 - k}c^{m - (6 - m)} = a^kb^{4 - k}c^{2m - 6}\\). But the question is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so \\(k = 2\\) and \\(4 - k = 2\\). So, the coefficient would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} \\times\\) [the sum of coefficients from the second part where \\(c^{2m - 6}\\) is present]. Wait, but the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, does that mean that the coefficient is 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\)? But that would make the coefficient a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. Wait, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where the exponents of \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are 2, 2, and 0 respectively. That would make more sense because then the coefficient would be a number. So, perhaps I misread the problem, and it's actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). Let me check the original problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" Hmm, it's just \\(a^2b^2\\), so maybe it's considering all possible powers of \\(c\\). But that would mean the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which would be a polynomial. But the problem is asking for a coefficient, which is usually a number. So, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), that is, the term where \\(a\\) is squared, \\(b\\) is squared, and \\(c\\) is to the zero power. That would make sense because then the coefficient would be a number. So, maybe I should proceed under that assumption. So, let's restate the problem: find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Now, that makes more sense. So, I need to find the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present and \\(c^0\\) is present. So, first, from the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, as I found earlier. Now, from the second part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\), which is the constant term. Because when I multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by the constant term in the second part, that will give me the term \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). So, I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). To find the constant term, I can use the binomial theorem again. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(1/c\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the exponent of \\(c\\) in each term is \\(6 - 2m\\). We need the exponent to be 0 for the constant term. So, set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). So, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20. Now, going back to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is the product of the coefficients from each part. So, that's 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the second part). So, 6 times 20 is 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) (assuming it's \\(a^2b^2c^0\\)) is 120. Let me double-check to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. First, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is indeed \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Then, the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is when the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, which occurs at \\(m = 3\\), and \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying these together gives 6 * 20 = 120. Yeah, that seems correct.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is found by considering the binomial expansions of both parts and identifying the constant term in the second expansion.\n\nStep-by-Step Solution:\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term \\(a^2b^2\\) occurs when \\(k = 2\\), so its coefficient is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\n   \\]\n\n2. **Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n   \\]\n   The constant term (\\(c^0\\)) occurs when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which gives \\(m = 3\\).

But wait, the problem isn't just \\((a + b)^4\\); it's multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I need to consider the entire expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nNow, I'm trying to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Let me think about how the multiplication works. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6a\u00b2b\u00b2. But when I multiply this by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), I need to see how this affects the coefficient. However, since the other part is in terms of c and 1/c, and the term \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve c, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would just be 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), right? Wait, no, that's not correct. Because when you multiply two polynomials, each term in one polynomial multiplies each term in the other. But since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term in \\((a + b)^4\\), and we're multiplying it by every term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term without c. Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider that the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is part of the product, and when multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the c terms will affect the overall expression, but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the c terms, we can treat them separately. Let me clarify.\n\nThe expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when you multiply these two expressions, each term from \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by every term in the second part. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product will be 6 times the sum of all coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because each term in the second expression contributes a coefficient that multiplies the 6a\u00b2b\u00b2 term.\n\nWait, but that's not correct either because each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) has a different power of c, so when you multiply, you get terms like \\(6a^2b^2c^k\\) for various k. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term without c. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) (i.e., the constant term) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because only the constant term, when multiplied by \\(6a^2b^2\\), would give a term with \\(a^2b^2\\) and no c terms. All other terms would have some power of c, so they wouldn't contribute to the \\(a^2b^2\\) term without c.\n\nSo, my next step is to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me compute that.\n\nAgain, using the binomial theorem, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\).\n\nWe need the term where the exponent of c is zero, because that's the constant term. So, we set the exponent equal to zero:\n\n\\(6 - 2k = 0\\)\n\nSolving for k:\n\n\\(2k = 6\\)\n\n\\(k = 3\\)\n\nSo, the constant term is when k = 3, which is:\n\n\\[\n\\dbinom{6}{3} c^{6 - 6} = \\dbinom{6}{3} c^0 = 20 \\times 1 = 20\n\\]\n\nSo, the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20.\n\nTherefore, going back to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (the constant term from the second part), which is 6 \u00d7 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but let me double-check that. So, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) from \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The only term that doesn't involve c is the constant term, which is 20. So, when you multiply \\(6a^2b^2\\) by 20, you get \\(120a^2b^2\\). All other terms would have some power of c, so they don't contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without c. Therefore, the coefficient is indeed 120.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in calculating the constant term. Let's compute \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). 6 choose 3 is 20, yes. So, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) as:\n\n\\[\n\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n\\]\n\nSo, the term where the exponent is zero is when 6 - 2k = 0, which is at k=3, and that's \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\), as I found earlier.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 \u00d7 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but another way to think about it is that when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each polynomial. So, in this case, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20, so their product is 120. That makes sense.\n\nI don't think I made any mistakes here. The key was realizing that to get the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without any c terms, I needed to multiply the coefficient from the first part by the constant term from the second part. So, yeah, I think the answer is 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break down the problem into two parts: expanding \\((a + b)^4\\) and finding the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\n1. **Expanding \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term containing \\(a^2b^2\\) is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\n   \\]\n   So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\n2. **Finding the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   Using the binomial theorem:\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n   \\]\n   The constant term occurs when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero:\n   \\[\n   6 - 2k = 0 \\implies k = 3\n   \\]\n   The constant term is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{6}{3} c^0 = 20\n   \\]\n\n3. **Combining the results:**\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) and the constant term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 20 = 120\n   \\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

So, that would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part, which is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. \n\nAlright, so let's find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Again, using the binomial theorem, the expansion is:\n\n\\[\n\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(1/c\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} c^{-k} = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n\\]\n\nWe need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, so we set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\). So, the constant term is when \\(k = 3\\), which is:\n\n\\[\n\\dbinom{6}{3} c^{0} = 20 \\cdot 1 = 20\n\\]\n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 20. \n\nNow, going back to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part, which is 20. So, 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake here. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion is multiplied by the term \\(c^0\\) from the second expansion, which is 20. So, the term in the product would be \\(6a^2b^2 * 20c^0 = 120a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120. \n\nWait, but let me double-check. Let me consider that when you multiply two polynomials, each term is a product of terms from each polynomial. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first polynomial, and the term \\(c^0\\) comes from the second polynomial. So, when you multiply them, you get \\(a^2b^2 * c^0\\), which is just \\(a^2b^2\\). The coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nAlternatively, if I think about the entire product, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial, but that's not correct because each term in the second polynomial is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), but we're only interested in the term where the second polynomial contributes a constant term, i.e., \\(c^0\\). So, yes, it's 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nWait, but another way to think about it is that the entire product is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, if we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\), but that's not the case because the problem specifies \\(a^2b^2\\), which would imply that it's looking for the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any power of \\(c\\). But that can't be because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would include all terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. Wait, but that would mean that the coefficient is actually the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire second polynomial. But that doesn't make sense because the second polynomial is a separate variable. \n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, perhaps they are treating \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\), and \\(1/c\\) as separate variables, and they're looking for the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2 each, regardless of the exponents of \\(c\\). But that would mean that the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of the second polynomial, which would be a polynomial in \\(c\\). But that doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a coefficient, which is a number, not a polynomial. \n\nWait, so perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where \\(a\\) is squared, \\(b\\) is squared, and \\(c\\) is to the zero power. That would make sense because then the coefficient would be a number, 120, as I calculated earlier. So, I think that's the correct interpretation. \n\nLet me confirm this by considering the entire expansion. Each term in the product will be of the form \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}a^{4 - k}b^k \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - m}(1/c)^m\\), which simplifies to \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}\\dbinom{6}{m} a^{4 - k}b^k c^{6 - 2m}\\). \n\nWe are looking for the term where \\(a^2b^2\\), so \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). So, \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Then, for \\(c^{6 - 2m}\\), we need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be zero, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which gives \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). \n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is 120, which is the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when considering only the terms where \\(c\\) is to the zero power. \n\nI think that makes sense. So, the answer is 120. \n\nWait, just to make sure I didn't make any calculation errors. Let me recalculate the binomial coefficients:\n\nFor \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Correct.\n\nFor \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the constant term is when \\(k = 3\\), so \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Correct.\n\nMultiplying 6 and 20 gives 120. Yes, that seems right.\n\nI think I'm confident that the coefficient is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and the constant term in the second part. \n\n1. Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is 6.\n2. Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) to find the constant term. This occurs when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, which gives a coefficient of 20.\n3. Multiply these coefficients: \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{120}"

    "text": " Let me write that out.\n\nSo, expanding \\((a + b)^4\\), the general term would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\\) where \\(k\\) goes from 0 to 4. I'm looking for the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2, right? Because the problem asks for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, that would mean \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). Let me check that. If \\(k = 2\\), then the exponent on \\(a\\) is \\(4 - 2 = 2\\) and the exponent on \\(b\\) is 2. Yep, that's the term I need.\n\nNow, the coefficient for this term is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Let me calculate that. \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient from the first part is 6. So, the term is \\(6a^2b^2\\).\n\nBut wait, the original expression isn't just \\((a + b)^4\\); it's multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I need to consider how this multiplication affects the coefficient. Hmm, I think I should expand the second part as well, but maybe I don't need to go through the entire expansion. Let me think.\n\nSince the first part gives me a term \\(6a^2b^2\\), and the second part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), when I multiply these two, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of the second part. But wait, the problem is asking only for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). That means I don't need to worry about the other terms because when I multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by anything else, it won't affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, is that right?\n\nWait, no, actually, that's not correct. Because when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. So, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that only involves \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), so any terms involving \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\) would result in terms that have \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or similar, which are different from \\(a^2b^2\\). So, actually, when you multiply \\(6a^2b^2\\) by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would just be \\(6\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part, but wait, that doesn't make sense because the expansion of the second part includes terms with \\(c\\), which would change the variables. So, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, perhaps the entire expression is being considered, and we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times any power of \\(c\\). But that seems a bit odd. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, considering all possible terms, but only the part that doesn't involve \\(c\\). Hmm, I'm a bit confused.\n\nWait, let me read the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, perhaps the problem is considering the entire expression, and we're looking for the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2 each, regardless of the exponents on \\(c\\). But that seems a bit strange because \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) are separate variables. Alternatively, maybe the problem is just considering the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, but since the other part is in terms of \\(c\\), perhaps the coefficient is just the product of the coefficients from each part. Hmm.\n\nWait, no, that doesn't make sense. Because when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficients multiply term by term. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the sum of all coefficients from the second part, because each term in the second part would multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term, effectively scaling it by the coefficient of each term in the second expansion. But that can't be right because that would give a different result.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try a different approach. Since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which only involves \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the other part of the expression is in terms of \\(c\\), maybe the coefficient is simply the product of the coefficients from each part. But that seems too simplistic.\n\nWait, no, because when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. So, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second part, which are terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would actually be the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the entire sum of the coefficients from the second part, but that's not correct because the second part's coefficients are not all the same.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to think differently. Since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, and the other part is in terms of \\(c\\), maybe the coefficient is just 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems off because the sum of coefficients in a polynomial is found by setting all variables to 1, so let's check that.\n\nIf I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = (1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of the coefficients in the second part is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). But wait, that seems high. Let me check if that's correct.\n\nWait, but the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\). So, when you multiply \\(6a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, each term will have a different power of \\(c\\). So, the only way for \\(a^2b^2\\) to appear without any \\(c\\) terms is if we multiply \\(6a^2b^2\\) by the term in the second expansion that has \\(c^0\\), which is the constant term. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is just 6 multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nAh, that makes more sense. So, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), then multiply that by 6 to get the final coefficient.\n\nOkay, so let's find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Again, using the binomial theorem, the expansion is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k\\). Simplifying that, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} c^{-k} = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\).\n\nWe want the exponent of \\(c\\) to be 0, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\).\n\nCalculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\).\n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake here. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first part with coefficient 6, and the term \\(c^0\\) comes from the second part with coefficient 20. When you multiply these two, you get \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\) as the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\). That seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of the entire expression as a product of two polynomials, one in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the other in \\(c\\). Since the variables are independent, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is just the product of the coefficients from each part, but only considering the terms where the exponents match for each variable. In this case, since we're only interested in \\(a^2b^2\\), and the other part has a term with \\(c^0\\), the coefficient is indeed 6 times 20, which is 120.\n\nWait, but another way to check is to consider that when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each polynomial. So, since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term in the first polynomial with coefficient 6, and \\(c^0\\) is a term in the second polynomial with coefficient 20, their product will contribute \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\) to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is just \\(a^2b^2\\).\n\nSo, I think that's correct. Therefore, the coefficient is 120.\n\nWait, let me just go through it one more time to make sure I didn't miss anything.\n\nFirst, expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem. The term with \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\\), so the coefficient is 6.\n\nNext, expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem. The general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - k}\\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\\). We want the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\). The coefficient for this term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n\nTherefore, when we multiply the two parts, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nYes, that seems correct. I think I've got it right.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break it down into two parts using the binomial theorem.\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\):**\n   The term with \\(a^2b^2\\) is given by:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2}a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\n   \\]\n   So, the coefficient from this part is 6.\n\n2. **Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   The general term is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - k}\\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\n   \\]\n   We seek the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0:\n   \\[\n   6 - 2k = 0 \\implies k = 3\n   \\]\n   The coefficient for this term is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\n   \\]\n\n3. **Combine the coefficients:**\n   Multiply the coefficients from both parts:\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 20 = 120\n   \\]\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

    "text": " Let me think about what the expansion of that would look like.\n\nSo, for \\((a + b)^4\\), the expansion would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{0}a^4b^0 + \\dbinom{4}{1}a^3b^1 + \\dbinom{4}{2}a^2b^2 + \\dbinom{4}{3}a^1b^3 + \\dbinom{4}{4}a^0b^4\\). Simplifying those binomial coefficients, that's \\(1 \\cdot a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + 1 \\cdot b^4\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in this part is 6. But wait, the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I think I need to consider how that affects the coefficient.\n\nHmm, but the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). That term only involves \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), so maybe the part with \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) doesn't affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)? Wait, no, because when you multiply two expressions together, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by every term in the second part, which is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so does that mean I need to consider all possible coefficients from the second part, or just the constant term? Wait, no, because \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), so when multiplied by terms involving \\(c\\), the result will have terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some \\(k\\). But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so maybe I'm misunderstanding something.\n\nWait, no, perhaps the problem is considering the entire product, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't make sense because \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term that's separate from \\(c\\). Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, which would include all the \\(c\\) terms as well. But that doesn't make sense because \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term without \\(c\\), so unless there's a term in the second part that cancels out the \\(c\\), but that seems unlikely.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again. The problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when you multiply these two expressions together, each term in the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, which is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would mean that we're looking for terms where the powers of \\(c\\) cancel out, i.e., \\(c^0\\), so that the term remains \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) attached. So, the coefficient would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part.\n\nWait, that makes sense. Because if you have \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by \\(c^0\\), you get \\(a^2b^2\\), but if you multiply it by \\(c^k\\) where \\(k \\neq 0\\), you'd get terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), which aren't just \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the only way to get a term with just \\(a^2b^2\\) is if the second part contributes a \\(c^0\\) term. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nSo, first, let's find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which we've already determined is 6. Now, we need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let's expand that using the binomial theorem as well. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k\\). Simplifying that, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\cdot c^{-k} = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\).\n\nWe need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be 0, so we set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\cdot 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20.\n\nNow, putting it all together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the product of the two coefficients we found: 6 (from \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\)) and 20 (from \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)). So, 6 multiplied by 20 is 120.\n\nWait, let me just double-check that. So, in the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6. In the second part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0 is when \\(k = 3\\), so \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, when you multiply these two parts together, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part, but only the term with \\(c^0\\) contributes to the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the product. So, the total coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but let me think again: when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second, and the coefficients multiply. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6a\u00b2b\u00b2, and the term \\(c^0\\) in the second part is 20. So, when you multiply them, you get 6 * 20 * a\u00b2b\u00b2 * c^0, which is 120a\u00b2b\u00b2. So, yes, the coefficient is 120.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not missing anything else. Is there a possibility that other terms in the second expansion could contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)? For example, if there's a term like \\(c^k\\) and another term \\(c^{-k}\\), but when multiplied together, they could give a constant term. But no, because we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, which would be the product of the coefficients from each part when the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out. So, the only way for that to happen is when the second part contributes a \\(c^0\\) term, which we've already calculated as 20.\n\nSo, I think I'm confident that the coefficient is 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem for both parts of the expression.\n\nFirst, consider the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n\\]\nThe term containing \\(a^2b^2\\) is:\n\\[\n\\dbinom{4}{2} a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\n\\]\nSo, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in this part is 6.\n\nNext, consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem:\n\\[\n\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n\\]\nWe need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, which occurs when:\n\\[\n6 - 2k = 0 \\implies k = 3\n\\]\nThe coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is:\n\\[\n\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\n\\]\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the product of the coefficients from each part:\n\\[\n6 \\times 20 = 120\n\\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

    "text": " Let me expand that part first.\n\nSo, for \\((a + b)^4\\), using the binomial theorem, it would be:\n\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\dbinom{4}{0}a^4b^0 + \\dbinom{4}{1}a^3b^1 + \\dbinom{4}{2}a^2b^2 + \\dbinom{4}{3}a^1b^3 + \\dbinom{4}{4}a^0b^4\n\\]\n\nCalculating each binomial coefficient:\n\n- \\(\\dbinom{4}{0} = 1\\)\n- \\(\\dbinom{4}{1} = 4\\)\n- \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\)\n- \\(\\dbinom{4}{3} = 4\\)\n- \\(\\dbinom{4}{4} = 1\\)\n\nSo, substituting these back in:\n\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = 1 \\cdot a^4 + 4 \\cdot a^3b + 6 \\cdot a^2b^2 + 4 \\cdot ab^3 + 1 \\cdot b^4\n\\]\n\nAlright, so that's the expansion of the first part. Now, the original expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I need to multiply this expanded form by the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nWait a second, but the question is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, perhaps I don't need to expand the entire expression, but just focus on the part that contributes to \\(a^2b^2\\). Let me think about that.\n\nSo, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) won't interact with the terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) in a way that affects the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression will just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because the \\(c\\) terms don't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) exponents.\n\nWait, that doesn't sound right. Let me clarify. Since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), the coefficient would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because when you multiply, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by every term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), so the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) would involve the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the sum of all coefficients in the second part.\n\nWait, no, that might not be correct. Let me think again. Actually, when you multiply two expressions together, each term from the first expression gets multiplied by each term from the second expression. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by every term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because each term in the second expression contributes its own coefficient when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\).\n\nBut wait, is that accurate? Let me consider an example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + d)^1\\). The expansion would be \\((a^2 + 2ab + b^2) \\times (c + d)\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) would be 1 (from \\(a^2\\)) multiplied by (c + d), so the coefficient of \\(a^2c\\) is 1*1 = 1, and \\(a^2d\\) is 1*1 = 1. Similarly, for \\(ab\\), the coefficient is 2, so when multiplied by (c + d), it's 2c and 2d. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the original problem would involve the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the sum of all coefficients in the second part, but that might not be the case because the second part is a separate variable.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me approach it differently. Since we're only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\), then in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will come from the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by every term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is \\(6 \\times\\) the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nBut wait, is that correct? Because when you multiply \\(6a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, each term will contribute a coefficient, and since \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each of those terms, the total coefficient for \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) (for any k) would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^k\\) in the second expansion. However, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but \\(a^2b^2\\) can be multiplied by any power of \\(c\\), so unless we're considering \\(a^2b^2\\) as a standalone term without any \\(c\\) terms, which I don't think is the case. Wait, the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), without any restriction on \\(c\\), so that would include all possible terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present, regardless of the power of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part.\n\nWait, but that doesn't seem right because when you multiply by each term in the second expansion, each term adds a different power of \\(c\\), so the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) across all possible \\(c\\) terms would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part. So, if I denote the sum of all coefficients in the second part as \\(S\\), then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be \\(6 \\times S\\).\n\nBut let me verify this. The sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) can be found by setting \\(c = 1\\), because substituting \\(c = 1\\) makes each term equal to its coefficient. So, let's compute that.\n\nSubstituting \\(c = 1\\), we get:\n\n\\[\n\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = (1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\n\\]\n\nSo, the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 64.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\nWait, but I'm not sure if this is correct because the problem might be asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms, but that's not possible because the expression is multiplied by terms involving \\(c\\). So, actually, every term in the product will have some power of \\(c\\), so maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would indeed be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, giving 384.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem, and it's actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), meaning the constant term in \\(c\\). That would make sense too because otherwise, the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make much sense as a single coefficient. So, maybe I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\) (the constant term in \\(c\\)).\n\nIf that's the case, then the approach would be different. Let me try that.\n\nSo, to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), I need to consider the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) from \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the constant term (i.e., the coefficient of \\(c^0\\)) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nSo, first, let me find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem again, the expansion is:\n\n\\[\n\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n\\]\n\nWe need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, i.e., \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\).\n\nSo, the constant term is:\n\n\\[\n\\dbinom{6}{3} c^{0} = 20 \\times 1 = 20\n\\]\n\nSo, the constant term is 20.\n\nNow, going back to the original product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part has a coefficient of 6, and it's multiplied by the constant term 20 from the second part. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nWait, but the problem didn't specify anything about \\(c\\), just \\(a^2b^2\\). So, maybe I was right the first time, and the answer is 384, considering all possible \\(c\\) terms. But the problem might be expecting the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\), which would be 120. Hmm, this is confusing.\n\nLet me check the problem statement again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" It doesn't specify any particular power of \\(c\\), so maybe it's considering all possible terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) appears, regardless of the power of \\(c\\). In that case, the coefficient would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nBut that seems a bit odd because when you multiply by different powers of \\(c\\), you're creating multiple terms with \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by different powers of \\(c\\). So, each of those would have a coefficient, but the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would be a sum of all those coefficients across different \\(c\\) terms. But that interpretation might not make sense because the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is being multiplied by various \\(c^k\\) terms, so each of those would be separate terms, and the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually be a polynomial in \\(c\\), not a single number. Therefore, perhaps the problem is expecting the coefficient when considering \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), i.e., the term where \\(c\\) cancels out.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is just expecting the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6*64=384. But that seems too large, and perhaps the problem expects a specific coefficient, not a polynomial.\n\nWait, let me think again. If I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then it's the same as saying that for each term in the product, if it has \\(a^2b^2\\), its coefficient is included. So, the total coefficient would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Because each term in the second part is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), so each coefficient from the second part contributes to the total coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) across all terms.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is written incorrectly, and it's supposed to be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be 120. But since the problem didn't specify, I'm not sure. Let me check the problem again: it's written as \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), and the question is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\).\n\nWait, another approach: perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\). That would make sense because otherwise, the coefficient would depend on \\(c\\), which isn't typical in such problems. So, I think the intended interpretation is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nWait, but let me make sure. Let me think about how the product works. Each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^k\\) would be \\(6 \\times\\) the coefficient of \\(c^k\\) in the second part. Therefore, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without any restriction on \\(c\\), it would be the sum over all \\(k\\) of \\(6 \\times\\) coefficient of \\(c^k\\), which is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which is 6*64=384.\n\nBut that seems odd because the coefficient would then be a scalar, not depending on \\(c\\), but when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by different powers of \\(c\\), each term is separate, and their coefficients add up. Wait, but if you're considering all possible \\(c^k\\) terms, then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) across all \\(c^k\\) would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which is 6*64=384.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), then it's 6*20=120.\n\nI think the confusion arises from how the problem is phrased. If it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), then it's 384. If it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it's 120.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is written in a way that it's just \\((a + b)^4\\) times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), and the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is being asked for, so the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would make the coefficient a polynomial in \\(c\\), which is 6*(expansion). But that seems unlikely because the problem is asking for a coefficient, which is typically a scalar.\n\nTherefore, I think the intended interpretation is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nWait, to confirm, let me compute the product step by step. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 20. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is 6*20=120.\n\nAlternatively, if I'm considering all possible \\(c^k\\), then the coefficient would be 6*64=384, but that would mean the coefficient is a constant, which doesn't make sense because \\(c\\) is a variable. So, I think the correct approach is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nWait, but let me make sure by expanding a small part. Let me consider \\((a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). Now, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) can be expanded as:\n\n\\[\n\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\cdot \\left(1/c\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n\\]\n\nSo, the terms are:\n\n- \\(k=0\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{0}c^6 = 1 \\cdot c^6\\)\n- \\(k=1\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{1}c^{4} = 6c^4\\)\n- \\(k=2\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{2}c^{2} = 15c^2\\)\n- \\(k=3\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}c^{0} = 20\\)\n- \\(k=4\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{4}c^{-2} = 15c^{-2}\\)\n- \\(k=5\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{5}c^{-4} = 6c^{-4}\\)\n- \\(k=6\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{6}c^{-6} = 1c^{-6}\\)\n\nSo, the expansion is \\(c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15c^{-2} + 6c^{-4} + c^{-6}\\).\n\nNow, when we multiply this by \\(6a^2b^2\\), we get:\n\n\\[\n6a^2b^2 \\times (c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15c^{-2} + 6c^{-4} + c^{-6})\n\\]\n\nWhich results in:\n\n\\[\n6a^2b^2c^6 + 36a^2b^2c^4 + 90a^2b^2c^2 + 120a^2b^2 + 90a^2b^2c^{-2} + 36a^2b^2c^{-4} + 6a^2b^2c^{-6}\n\\]\n\nSo, in this expansion, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is present as \\(120a^2b^2\\), which is the constant term in \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) (assuming it's the constant term in \\(c\\)) is 120.\n\nBut if we were to consider all terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) appears, regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then the coefficient would be the sum of all the coefficients in front of each \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) term, which would be 6 + 36 + 90 + 120 + 90 + 36 + 6 = let's compute that.\n\n6 + 36 = 42\n\n42 + 90 = 132\n\n132 + 120 = 252\n\n252 + 90 = 342\n\n342 + 36 = 378\n\n378 + 6 = 384\n\nSo, the sum of all coefficients for \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) across all \\(k\\) is 384. Therefore, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), it's 384. But if it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), it's 120.\n\nGiven that the problem didn't specify anything about \\(c\\), it's ambiguous. However, in standard problems, when they ask for the coefficient of a term without specifying other variables, they usually mean the term where those other variables are at their neutral or constant power, which in this case would be \\(c^0\\). Therefore, I think the intended answer is 120.\n\nWait, but let me check again. If the problem is written as \\((a + b)^4 \\times (c + 1/c)^6\\), and it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), it's possible that they mean the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any power of \\(c\\), so the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6*64=384. But that would mean that the coefficient is 384, regardless of the power of \\(c\\), which is a bit non-standard.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is miswritten, and they intended to ask for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nWait, to resolve this, let me consider the problem again. It says: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, strictly speaking, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be part of the product, but in reality, each term in the product is of the form \\(a^kb^{4 - k}c^{m}c^{-n}\\), where \\(m - n\\) is some integer. Therefore, \\(a^2b^2\\) would be present in multiple terms, each multiplied by different powers of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be a polynomial in \\(c\\), which is not a single number. Therefore, perhaps the problem is expecting the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is written in a way that \\(c\\) is not considered, but that seems unlikely because it's part of the expression. So, given the ambiguity, I think the intended answer is 120, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\).\n\nWait, but let me think about the problem again. The problem is written as \\((a + b)^4 \\times (c + 1/c)^6\\). So, when you expand this, the product will have terms like \\(a^kb^{4 - k}c^{m}\\) where \\(m\\) is an integer from -6 to 6. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be present multiplied by various powers of \\(c\\), each with their own coefficients. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is not a single number but a sum of coefficients across different powers of \\(c\\). But that seems unusual because coefficients are typically scalar values.\n\nTherefore, perhaps the problem is intended to ask for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. So, I think that's the correct approach.\n\nWait, another way to think about it: if the problem had only \\((a + b)^4\\), then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. But when multiplied by \\((c + 1/c)^6\\), each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\((c + 1/c)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\((c + 1/c)^6\\), which is 6*64=384.\n\nWait, but that would mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 384, regardless of the power of \\(c\\). But that seems to treat the coefficient as a scalar, which is only possible if we're summing over all possible \\(c\\) terms, which is not standard.\n\nTherefore, I think the problem is intended to ask for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is simply to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable, so the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\((c + 1/c)^6\\), which is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But that's not a single coefficient; it's a polynomial. So, that can't be.\n\nTherefore, the only sensible interpretation is that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nWait, but let me check the problem again. It says: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, it's possible that the problem is written correctly, and the answer is 384, but that would mean the coefficient is a scalar, which is only possible if we're summing all coefficients across all \\(c\\) terms. But that's not standard. So, perhaps the problem is expecting 120.\n\nI think I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try to find an authoritative approach. In problems like this, when they ask for the coefficient of a term without specifying other variables, they usually mean the term where those variables are at their lowest possible power, which in this case would be \\(c^0\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is 120.\n\nTherefore, I think the answer is 120.\n\nWait, but I'm still not entirely sure. Let me consider that the problem might have a typo and that they meant to ask for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). Alternatively, perhaps they intended to ask for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), which would be 384. But without more context, it's hard to say.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is considering \\(c\\) as a separate variable, and the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 384. But that seems non-standard.\n\nWait, let me think about the problem in another way. If I were to collect all terms that have \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then each such term would have a coefficient, and the total coefficient would be the sum of those coefficients. So, for each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times that coefficient. Therefore, the total coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) across all \\(c\\) terms would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6*64=384.\n\nBut again, that would mean the coefficient is a scalar, which is the sum of all possible coefficients when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). That seems unusual, but mathematically, it's possible.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to ask for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nGiven the ambiguity, I think the most reasonable interpretation is that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nWait, to confirm, let me compute the product:\n\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\n\\]\n\\[\n\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15c^{-2} + 6c^{-4} + c^{-6}\n\\]\n\nMultiplying these together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, resulting in:\n\n\\[\n6a^2b^2c^6 + 36a^2b^2c^4 + 90a^2b^2c^2 + 120a^2b^2 + 90a^2b^2c^{-2} + 36a^2b^2c^{-4} + 6a^2b^2c^{-6}\n\\]\n\nSo, in this product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is present with various powers of \\(c\\), each multiplied by their respective coefficients. Therefore, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), it's the sum of all coefficients in front of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), which is 6 + 36 + 90 + 120 + 90 + 36 + 6 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), it's 120.\n\nGiven that the problem didn't specify, but in standard problems, when they ask for the coefficient of a term without mentioning other variables, they usually mean the term where those variables are at their neutral power, which in this case would be \\(c^0\\). Therefore, I think the intended answer is 120.\n\nWait, but let me think again. If the problem had been \\((a + b)^4 \\times (c + d)^6\\), then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of coefficients in \\((c + d)^6\\), which is 6*(2^6)=384, because each term in \\((c + d)^6\\) contributes to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when multiplied by \\(6a^2b^2\\).\n\nSimilarly, in this case, since \\((c + 1/c)^6\\) is also a binomial expansion, the sum of its coefficients is 2^6=64, so 6*64=384.\n\nTherefore, perhaps the intended answer is 384.\n\nWait, but in the case where the problem had \\((a + b)^4 \\times (c + d)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would indeed be 6*64=384, because each term in \\((c + d)^6\\) is multiplied by \\(6a^2b^2\\), so the total coefficient is 6 times the sum of coefficients in \\((c + d)^6\\), which is 6*64=384.\n\nSimilarly, in our problem, since \\((c + 1/c)^6\\) has a sum of coefficients equal to 64, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6*64=384.\n\nTherefore, I think the correct answer is 384.\n\nWait, but that contradicts my earlier reasoning where I thought it was 120. So, which is it?\n\nI think the confusion arises from whether the problem is considering the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\) or specifically \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). If it's the former, the answer is 384; if it's the latter, it's 120.\n\nGiven that in the problem statement, \\(c\\) is another variable, and the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), without any reference to \\(c\\), it's likely that they want the coefficient across all possible \\(c\\) terms, which would be 384.\n\nTherefore, after considering both interpretations, I think the correct answer is 384.\n\nWait, but to be thorough, let me compute the product more carefully.\n\nEach term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), resulting in terms like \\(6a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(36a^2b^2c^4\\), etc. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the sum of all coefficients from each of these terms. Therefore, it's 6*(1 + 6 + 15 + 20 + 15 + 6 + 1) = 6*64=384.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 384.\n\nWait, but in the earlier expansion, I saw that \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6*64=384.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is 384.\n\nI think I was confused earlier because I was considering only the \\(c^0\\) term, but the problem didn't specify, so it's more reasonable to consider the coefficient across all \\(c\\) terms, which is 384.\n\nSo, to summarize:\n\n1. Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem, which gives the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) as 6.\n\n2. Recognize that when multiplying by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\).\n\n3. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is therefore 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\"

    "text": " Let me write that out using the binomial theorem.\n\nFor \\((a + b)^4\\), the expansion would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{0}a^4b^0 + \\dbinom{4}{1}a^3b^1 + \\dbinom{4}{2}a^2b^2 + \\dbinom{4}{3}a^1b^3 + \\dbinom{4}{4}a^0b^4\\). So, the terms are \\(a^4\\), \\(4a^3b\\), \\(6a^2b^2\\), \\(4ab^3\\), and \\(b^4\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) here is 6. But wait, the problem isn't just \\((a + b)^4\\); it's multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I need to consider how that affects the coefficient.\n\nHmm, so the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Since multiplication is distributive over addition, each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But the question is specifically asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, I think that means I need to find the term in the product where the variables are \\(a^2b^2\\), and then find its coefficient, regardless of what's happening with \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\).\n\nWait, but actually, when you multiply two expressions together, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term from the second part, which is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But the question is about the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which suggests that we're looking for the coefficient when considering all possible products that result in \\(a^2b^2\\). But wait, no, because in the entire product, each term will have both \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) parts and \\(c\\) parts. So, actually, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term from the second expression, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the entire second part, because \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), so when you multiply, each term in the first part's \\(a^2b^2\\) term will be multiplied by each term in the second part, but since \\(a^2b^2\\) is just a part of the product, perhaps I'm overcomplicating.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Let me read the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, perhaps the question is asking for the coefficient of the term that has \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). But that doesn't make much sense because when you multiply, each term in the first part will have some power of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and each term in the second part will have some power of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, the entire product will have terms like \\(a^kb^{4 - k}c^m\\) or something like that, where \\(k\\) ranges from 0 to 4 and \\(m\\) ranges from, say, -6 to 6, depending on the expansion.\n\nWait, but the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so that would be the coefficient when \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any term from the second expression, regardless of the \\(c\\) part. So, the coefficient would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't seem right because that would make the coefficient a polynomial in \\(c\\), but the question is just asking for a coefficient, which is a number. So, maybe I'm misunderstanding the question.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), that is, the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\), so that the entire term is \\(a^2b^2\\). So, in that case, we need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product. So, that would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Because when you multiply, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part would be multiplied by each term in the second part, but only the term where \\(c^0\\) would result in the term \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). So, that makes sense.\n\nSo, let me break it down. First, find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\). As I did earlier, using the binomial theorem, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Then, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Because when I multiply these two coefficients together, I'll get the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is just \\(a^2b^2\\). So, that's the term we're interested in.\n\nNow, let's find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Again, using the binomial theorem, the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(1/c\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be 0, so we set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\).\n\nCalculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). Wait, let me check that calculation again. 6! is 720, 3! is 6, so 6!/(3!3!) = 720/(6*6) = 720/36 = 20. Yes, that's correct. So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20.\n\nNow, going back to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\) with coefficient 6, and \\(c^0\\) comes from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) with coefficient 20. So, when you multiply these two terms together, you get 6 * 20 = 120, and the variables are \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is just \\(a^2b^2\\). So, that should be the coefficient.\n\nBut wait, let me think again. When you multiply two expressions, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expression is multiplied by each term in the second expression. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the entire second expression. But that can't be right because the second expression is a polynomial in \\(c\\), so the coefficient would actually be a polynomial in \\(c\\), not a single number. Therefore, I think the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), that is, the term where the exponents of \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are 2, 2, and 0 respectively.\n\nSo, that makes sense. Therefore, the coefficient is indeed 6 * 20 = 120. So, I think that's the answer.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't miss anything else. Let me go through the steps again.\n\n1. Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n\n2. Expand \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem. Each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\\). We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\). The coefficient here is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n\n3. Multiply these two coefficients together because the terms \\(a^2b^2\\) and \\(c^0\\) are multiplied together in the product. So, 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nYes, that seems correct. I don't see any mistakes in that reasoning. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is 120.\n\nWait, but just to be thorough, let me consider an alternative approach. Maybe I can think of the entire expression as a product of two independent expansions, and since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are different variables, their exponents don't interfere with each other. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and the sum of all coefficients in the second part. But wait, that can't be right because the second part is a Laurent polynomial in \\(c\\), so the sum of all its coefficients isn't a single number. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only considering the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, but that would mean adding up all the coefficients from the second part, which isn't a number but a polynomial. So, that can't be the case. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\), giving a term with just \\(a^2b^2\\), and the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, without considering \\(c\\). But that would mean that we're treating \\(c\\) as a variable independent of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), so the coefficient would actually be a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for a coefficient, which is a number, so that can't be the case. Therefore, the only way the coefficient is a number is if we're considering the term where \\(c^0\\) is involved, so that the entire term is just \\(a^2b^2\\). So, that's why we need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part and multiply it by the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part.\n\nTherefore, I think 120 is the correct answer. I don't see any errors in my reasoning, so I'm confident that's the right coefficient.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is found by considering the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\n1. **Coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\):**\n   Using the binomial theorem, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n\n2. **Coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   The term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0 occurs when \\(k = 3\\), giving \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n\n3. **Multiply the coefficients:**\n   \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer:** \\(\\boxed{120}\\)"

The entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I can't just take 6 as the final answer; I need to consider how this multiplication affects the coefficient.\n\nHmm, so the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Since these two parts are multiplied together, the terms from each expansion will multiply term by term. But since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are different variables, their exponents won't interfere with each other. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, is that right? Because when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first polynomial gets multiplied by each term in the second polynomial.\n\nBut in this case, we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Since the second polynomial only involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), when we multiply, the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) won't be affected by the \\(c\\) terms. So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because when you multiply by each term in the second polynomial, you're effectively scaling the \\(a^2b^2\\) term by each coefficient of the \\(c\\) terms.\n\nWait, that might not be correct. Let me think again. Actually, when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part will be multiplied by every term in the second part. But since the second part is in terms of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), the product will have terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) and \\(a^2b^2 \\cdot c^{-k}\\), etc. But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, does that mean we need to consider all the terms in the second polynomial and sum their coefficients, then multiply by the coefficient from the first part?\n\nWait, no. Because the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, actually, every term in the second polynomial will contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second polynomial, each of those terms has a coefficient, and all those coefficients add up to the total coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\).\n\nWait, that seems right. Let me verify. Suppose we have two polynomials: \\(P(a, b) = (a + b)^4\\) and \\(Q(c) = \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The product \\(P(a, b) \\cdot Q(c)\\) will have terms like \\(a^4c^6\\), \\(4a^3bc^5\\), \\(6a^2b^2c^4\\), etc. So, if we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), we need to consider all the terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by some power of \\(c\\). Each of these terms will have the coefficient \\(6\\) (from \\(a^2b^2\\)) multiplied by the coefficient of the corresponding \\(c\\) term in \\(Q(c)\\).\n\nTherefore, the total coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be \\(6\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(Q(c)\\). So, now I need to find the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nThe sum of all coefficients in a polynomial is found by evaluating the polynomial at \\(c = 1\\). Because substituting \\(c = 1\\) makes each term equal to its coefficient. So, let me compute \\(\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = (1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the sum of all coefficients in \\(Q(c)\\) is 64.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\nWait, but let me check that again. Because when I expand \\(Q(c)\\), the coefficients can be positive and negative, but in this case, since all terms are positive, the sum is 64. So, yes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, I could think about the expansion of \\(Q(c)\\). The expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, each term has a coefficient \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}\\) and a power of \\(c\\) equal to \\(6 - 2k\\).\n\nTherefore, the sum of all coefficients is indeed \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} = 2^6 = 64\\), which confirms the earlier result.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\nWait a second, but let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. Because sometimes when you have variables multiplied together, you might have to consider cross terms, but in this case, since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are all separate variables, their exponents don't interfere. So, when you multiply, the exponents just add independently. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part, which are all in terms of \\(c\\). Therefore, each of these products will be terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), and since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), we need to sum all the coefficients from the second polynomial and multiply by the coefficient from the first polynomial.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So, the coefficient is indeed \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\nAlternatively, if I were to think about it differently, suppose I consider the entire expression as a product of two polynomials. The first polynomial is in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the second is in \\(c\\). Since they are independent variables, the multiplication is straightforward, and the coefficients just multiply as I thought.\n\nWait, but just to be thorough, let me try expanding both parts and see if the logic holds. Let's write out \\((a + b)^4\\) as \\(a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\), as before. Now, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) expands to \\(c^6 + 6c^5 + 15c^4 + 20c^3 + 15c^2 + 6c + 1\\). Wait, is that correct?\n\nWait, let me compute \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem. It's \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\cdot \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, the terms are:\n\n- \\(k = 0\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{0}c^6 = 1 \\cdot c^6\\)\n- \\(k = 1\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{1}c^4 = 6c^4\\)\n- \\(k = 2\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{2}c^2 = 15c^2\\)\n- \\(k = 3\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}c^0 = 20\\)\n- \\(k = 4\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{4}c^{-2} = 15c^{-2}\\)\n- \\(k = 5\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{5}c^{-4} = 6c^{-4}\\)\n- \\(k = 6\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{6}c^{-6} = 1c^{-6}\\)\n\nSo, the expansion is \\(c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15c^{-2} + 6c^{-4} + c^{-6}\\). So, the coefficients are 1, 6, 15, 20, 15, 6, 1. Summing these coefficients: 1 + 6 = 7, 7 + 15 = 22, 22 + 20 = 42, 42 + 15 = 57, 57 + 6 = 63, 63 + 1 = 64. So, that confirms the sum is 64.\n\nTherefore, when I multiply each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) will be 6 multiplied by each of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but since we're summing over all coefficients, it's 6 multiplied by 64, which is 384.\n\nWait, but another way to think about it is: when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum of the products of coefficients of terms whose variables multiply to give that specific term. In this case, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial is being multiplied by every term in the second polynomial, which doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\). Therefore, each of these multiplications will contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, because the \\(a^2b^2\\) term is being scaled by each coefficient in the second polynomial.\n\nSo, yes, that means the coefficient is 6 (from \\(a^2b^2\\)) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 64, giving 384.\n\nWait, but let me check if there's another approach. Maybe using multinomial coefficients or something else. But I think the approach I took is correct. Alternatively, perhaps I can consider that since the variables are independent, the coefficient is just the product of the coefficients from each part. But no, because in this case, we're looking for a specific term in the product, which involves both \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), but not \\(c\\). So, the coefficient is the product of the coefficient from the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) part and the sum of all coefficients from the \\(c\\) part.\n\nWait, but to be precise, when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a term in the product is the sum of the products of the coefficients of terms whose variables multiply to give that term. So, in this case, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial is being multiplied by every term in the second polynomial, regardless of the power of \\(c\\). Therefore, each of these products will contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, with their respective coefficients. So, the total coefficient is indeed the sum over all coefficients from the second polynomial multiplied by the coefficient from the first polynomial.\n\nTherefore, I think my earlier conclusion is correct. The coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but just to be absolutely sure, let me try a smaller example to see if the logic holds. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^2 \\cdot (c + 1/c)^1\\). Let's compute this.\n\nFirst, expand \\((a + b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2\\).\n\nThen, expand \\((c + 1/c)^1 = c + 1/c\\).\n\nNow, multiply them together: \\((a^2 + 2ab + b^2)(c + 1/c)\\).\n\nExpanding this, we get:\n\n- \\(a^2c + a^2/c + 2abc + 2ab/c + b^2c + b^2/c\\).\n\nNow, the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) in this product would be the sum of the coefficients of \\(a^2\\) multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. But in this case, the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) is 1, and the sum of coefficients in the second polynomial is \\(1 + 1 = 2\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) in the product is 1 * 2 = 2, which matches the terms \\(a^2c\\) and \\(a^2/c\\), each with coefficient 1, so total 2.\n\nSimilarly, the coefficient of \\(ab\\) in the product is 2 (from the first polynomial) multiplied by the sum of coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 2, so 2 * 2 = 4. Looking at the terms, we have \\(2abc\\) and \\(2ab/c\\), each with coefficient 2, so total 4.\n\nSimilarly, the coefficient of \\(b^2\\) is 1 * 2 = 2, from \\(b^2c\\) and \\(b^2/c\\).\n\nSo, this smaller example confirms that the coefficient of a specific term in the first polynomial multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial gives the correct coefficient in the product. Therefore, applying this logic to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me compute the entire product for a small case and see.\n\nWait, in the small example, I saw that it worked. So, I think the approach is correct.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient is 384.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{384}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem and properties of polynomial multiplication.\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term containing \\(a^2b^2\\) is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\n   \\]\n   Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\n2. **Consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n   \\]\n   The sum of all coefficients in this expansion is found by evaluating the polynomial at \\(c = 1\\):\n   \\[\n   \\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\n   \\]\n\n3. **Combine the results:**\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 64 = 384\n   \\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{384}\\)."

    "text": " Let me write that out using the binomial theorem.\n\nSo, \\((a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\\). Now, I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). That means I need to find the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2. So, in the binomial expansion, \\(4 - k = 2\\) for \\(a\\), which means \\(k = 2\\). So, the term is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} a^{2}b^{2}\\). Let me calculate that binomial coefficient. \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient from the first part is 6.\n\nNow, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I also need to consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, since I'm only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which involves \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the other part involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), which are different variables, maybe I don't need to worry about the \\(c\\) terms when finding the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\). Or do I?\n\nWait, actually, the entire expression is the product of two expansions. So, when I multiply them together, each term from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term from the second expansion. But since I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I need to make sure that when I multiply terms from the second expansion, they don't affect the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. That is, the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), when expanded, will have terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), but when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), it will just be a coefficient multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\) times some power of \\(c\\). But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I think I can treat the second part as just a constant multiplier for the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. Is that right?\n\nWait, no, that might not be correct. Because the problem is written as \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), so when you expand both parts, you have to consider all possible products of terms from each expansion. However, since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), the only way the product will have \\(a^2b^2\\) is if we take the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part and multiply it by any term from the second part. But since the second part doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), all the terms from the second part will just be constants (with respect to \\(a\\) and \\(b\\)) when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire second part's expansion. But that doesn't seem right because the second part isn't a constant; it's a sum of terms involving \\(c\\).\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of what happens with \\(c\\). So, in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the expansion will be of the form (coefficient from first part) * (coefficient from second part) * \\(a^{something}b^{something}c^{something}\\). But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), I think we can treat the second part as a constant when considering the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient would be the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. But that doesn't make sense because the second part isn't a constant; it's a sum of terms. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I need to compute the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and then multiply it by the entire expansion of the second part, but that would mean the coefficient is a sum of terms involving \\(c\\). But the problem is just asking for a numerical coefficient, not involving \\(c\\). So perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Wait, no, the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, which includes all terms, but since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term that is multiplied by various powers of \\(c\\), the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient, so maybe it's just the numerical part, treating the rest as variables? Or perhaps the problem is considering only the coefficient, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms.\n\nWait, let me read the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, in this context, the coefficient would include any factors from the second part, as they are coefficients attached to \\(a^2b^2\\). So, for each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), it becomes a term like \\(k \\cdot a^2b^2c^n\\), where \\(k\\) is the coefficient from the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is actually the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion, each multiplied by the coefficient from the first part. But wait, no, because each term in the second expansion is multiplied by each term in the first expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by every term in the second expansion, each contributing their own coefficients. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part.\n\nWait, that makes more sense. Because when you multiply two expressions, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each factor. But in this case, since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is by taking the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part and multiplying it by every possible term from the second part. So, the coefficient would be 6 (from the first part) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part.\n\nWait, but the second part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me compute the sum of its coefficients. The sum of the coefficients of a polynomial is found by setting all variables to 1. So, if I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = (2)^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of all coefficients in the second part is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but that seems too straightforward. Let me verify. Alternatively, maybe I'm supposed to consider that the coefficient is 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part, but that would result in a polynomial, not a single coefficient. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would include all the terms from the second expansion multiplied by 6. So, perhaps the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of the second part. But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think again. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When expanding this, each term will be of the form \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}a^{4 - k}b^{k}\\) multiplied by \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - m}\\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the general term is \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}\\dbinom{6}{m} a^{4 - k}b^{k}c^{6 - 2m}\\).\n\nNow, we are looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, that means we need \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). So, \\(k = 2\\), and the coefficient from the first part is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Now, for each such term, it's multiplied by \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the sum over all \\(m\\) of \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\dbinom{6}{m}\\). Since \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term from the second expansion, the coefficient is 6 multiplied by the sum of \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\) for all \\(m\\).\n\nBut the sum of \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\) for \\(m = 0\\) to \\(6\\) is \\(2^6 = 64\\), as I thought earlier. So, the coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 384.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. If I expand \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. Then, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) expands to a sum of terms, each with a coefficient. When I multiply 6 by each of those coefficients, I get the total contribution to the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. So, the total coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of it as the coefficient being 6 multiplied by the entire expansion, but that doesn't make sense because the expansion includes variables. So, I think my reasoning is correct.\n\nWait, but another way to look at it is that the entire expression is a product of two polynomials, one in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the other in \\(c\\). So, when you multiply them, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the entire second part, because the second part doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\). So, the coefficient would be 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would make the coefficient a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't seem right because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. So, perhaps the problem is expecting just the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, and the second part is irrelevant because it's multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). But that doesn't make sense because the entire expression is a product, so the coefficient would indeed be 6 times the sum of coefficients from the second part.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is expecting the coefficient as a polynomial in \\(c\\), but the way it's phrased, \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", suggests a numerical coefficient, not a polynomial. So, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where \\(c\\) cancels out. Because if I'm looking for \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which is 6*64=384. But if I'm looking for \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then I need to find the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, i.e., \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Then, the coefficient would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} \\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Let's compute that.\n\n\\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\), so 6 * 20 = 120. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is 120. But the problem didn't specify anything about \\(c\\), just \\(a^2b^2\\). So, I think the correct interpretation is that the coefficient is 384, considering all powers of \\(c\\). But I'm a bit confused because usually, when you talk about the coefficient of a term in a product, you have to consider all possible combinations that result in that term. But in this case, since \\(a^2b^2\\) is separate from \\(c\\), the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of the second part, which is 6*64=384. But that seems too large.\n\nWait, maybe I should think differently. Let me try to write the entire expansion more carefully. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When expanded, each term is \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}a^{4 - k}b^{k} \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - m}\\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\dbinom{4}{k}\\dbinom{6}{m}a^{4 - k}b^{k}c^{6 - 2m}\\).\n\nNow, we are looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which means we need \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). So, \\(k = 2\\), and the coefficient from the first part is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Now, for each \\(m\\) from 0 to 6, we have a term \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the sum over all \\(m\\) of \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\dbinom{6}{m}\\). That is, 6 times the sum of \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\) for \\(m = 0\\) to \\(6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384. So, the coefficient is 384.\n\nBut wait, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then it's correct. But if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it's different. Since the problem didn't specify anything about \\(c\\), I think it's just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would include all possible powers of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient is 384.\n\nWait, but let me check with specific numbers. Let's compute \\((a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). Now, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) can be expanded as \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - m}(1/c)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\).\n\nSo, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second part, resulting in \\(6a^2b^2 \\times \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is \\(6 \\times \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m}\\), which is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\nYes, that makes sense. So, the coefficient is 384.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me compute \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m}\\). That's \\(2^6 = 64\\), as I thought before. So, 6 * 64 = 384. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 384.\n\nI think that's the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break the problem into two parts using the binomial theorem.\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\):**\n   The term \\(a^2b^2\\) in this expansion is given by \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient is 6.\n\n2. **Consider \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   The sum of the coefficients in this expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), resulting in \\(2^6 = 64\\).\n\n3. **Combine the results:**\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the two coefficients, which is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{384}\\)."

Because when you multiply them, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part will be multiplied by the constant term from the second part, resulting in a term that is \\(a^2b^2 \\times\\) (constant), which is just \\(a^2b^2\\) with the coefficient being the product of the two coefficients.\n\nSo, first, I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which I already found as 6. Then, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me work on that.\n\nExpanding \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem: \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k\\). Simplifying each term, that becomes \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} c^{-k}\\), which is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\).\n\nWe are looking for the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, because that's the constant term. So, we set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), and solve for \\(k\\). So, \\(6 - 2k = 0\\) implies \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the term where \\(k = 3\\) is the constant term. The coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). Wait, that doesn't seem right. Let me check: 6! is 720, 3! is 6, so 720/(6\u00d76) is 720/36, which is indeed 20. So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20.\n\nNow, going back to the original problem. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficient from the first part and the coefficient from the second part. So, that's 6 (from \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\)) multiplied by 20 (from \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\)). So, 6 \u00d7 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120.\n\nWait, but let me just make sure I didn't make any mistakes. So, in the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6, because \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). In the second part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the constant term is when the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, which occurs at \\(k = 3\\), and \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, 6 \u00d7 20 is 120. That seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of it another way to confirm. Let me consider the entire product \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\), and \\(1/c\\) are all variables, the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from those involving \\(c\\). Therefore, when looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I can treat the two parts independently. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part is 20, so when multiplied together, they give 120. So, yes, that seems correct.\n\nI think that's solid. So, the coefficient is 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem for both parts of the product.\n\nFirst, we expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n\\]\nThe term containing \\(a^2b^2\\) is found when \\(k = 2\\):\n\\[\n\\dbinom{4}{2} a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\n\\]\nSo, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\nNext, we expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem:\n\\[\n\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n\\]\nWe need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0 (the constant term). Setting \\(6 - 2k = 0\\) gives \\(k = 3\\):\n\\[\n\\dbinom{6}{3} c^{0} = 20\n\\]\nSo, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20.\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the product of the coefficients from each part:\n\\[\n6 \\times 20 = 120\n\\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

But wait, the original expression isn't just \\((a + b)^4\\), it's multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I need to consider how that affects the coefficient.\n\nI think the key here is that when you multiply two expressions together, the coefficients multiply as well for the corresponding terms. But wait, actually, no, that's not quite right. Because when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first polynomial multiplies each term in the second polynomial, and you add up the coefficients for the same variables. But in this case, the two parts of the expression, \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), are in different variables. The first part has variables \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the second part has variables \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, actually, the terms in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are independent of the terms in \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). That means that when I multiply them, the coefficients for the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms don't affect the coefficients for the \\(c\\) terms. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but since we are only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and the other part doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), the coefficient remains 6, and when multiplied by the expansion of the second part, which doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be 6 times whatever comes from the second expression. Wait, no, that can't be right because the second expression is also being multiplied, but it's in terms of \\(c\\), so it doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would just be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but since we are only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of what happens with \\(c\\), the coefficient remains 6. Wait, but that seems too simple. Let me think again.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I need to consider that the entire expression is the product of two expansions, so when you multiply them, each term from the first expansion is multiplied by each term from the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all terms from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't make sense because each term from the first part is multiplied by each term from the second part, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually be the coefficient from the first part times the entire second expansion, but that's not correct because we are looking for a specific term \\(a^2b^2\\), and the second part doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), so when you multiply, the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from those involving \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would just be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, multiplied by the entire sum of the coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, that doesn't sound right either because each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but since we are only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems complicated, maybe I'm overcomplicating it.\n\nWait, perhaps a better approach is to recognize that since the variables \\(a, b\\) and \\(c\\) are independent, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is simply the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems too involved. Alternatively, maybe I can think of it as the product of two independent expansions, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the same as in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all possible terms from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that's not exactly correct because each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems complicated, maybe I'm missing a simpler approach.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me think again. The problem asks for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression. Since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) is by taking the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from \\((a + b)^4\\) and multiplying it by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But when you multiply, each term in the product will have terms from both expansions. However, since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of what happens with \\(c\\), the coefficient would just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, that seems plausible, but I'm not sure. Let me try to compute that.\n\nFirst, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, as I found earlier. Now, the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, if I multiply 6 by 64, I get 384. So, is the coefficient 384? Hmm, that seems high. Let me check if that's correct.\n\nWait, but actually, when you have two expressions multiplied together, the coefficient of a specific term in one expression is multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the other expression. So, yes, in this case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 64, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 * 64 = 384. Hmm, that seems correct, but I want to make sure.\n\nAlternatively, another way to think about it is that when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a term in one polynomial is multiplied by all terms in the other polynomial. So, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first polynomial is multiplied by every term in the second polynomial, which has 7 terms (from \\(c^6\\) down to \\(c^{-6}\\)). But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the sum of the coefficients of all terms in the second polynomial, which is 64. So, 6 * 64 = 384. That seems to make sense.\n\nWait, but let me think again. The second polynomial is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When expanded, each term is of the form \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, each term has a coefficient \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}\\) and a power of \\(c\\) of \\(6 - 2k\\). So, when I multiply this by \\(a^2b^2\\), which is from the first part, each term in the product will be \\(6 \\cdot \\dbinom{6}{k} a^2b^2 c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the sum of all coefficients from the second polynomial multiplied by 6, which is 6 * (sum of \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}\\) for k from 0 to 6). But the sum of \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}\\) from k=0 to 6 is \\(2^6 = 64\\), so 6 * 64 = 384. So, that seems correct.\n\nWait, but another way to think about it is that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the same as the coefficient in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of the second polynomial, but since we're only interested in the coefficient, it's just 6 multiplied by the sum of the coefficients of the second polynomial, which is 64, giving 384. So, I think that's the right answer.\n\nBut let me just check if I'm not making a mistake here. Sometimes when you have products of polynomials, the coefficients can interfere, but in this case, since the variables are separate, the coefficients just multiply. So, yes, I think 384 is correct.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me consider a simpler case. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^1 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, expanding, it would be \\((a + b)(c + 1/c)\\). The coefficient of \\(a^1b^0\\) would be 1 times the sum of coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 1 + 1 = 2, so 1 * 2 = 2. Similarly, the coefficient of \\(a^0b^1\\) would be 1 * 2 = 2. So, in that case, it works. Similarly, if I take \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^2\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^0\\) would be 1 times the sum of coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 4, so 1 * 4 = 4, and the coefficient of \\(a^1b^1\\) would be 2 times 4 = 8, and so on. So, that seems to confirm that the approach is correct.\n\nTherefore, I think the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(2^6 = 64\\). Multiplying these together gives \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{384}\n\\]"

Calculating the coefficients, that would be \\(1a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + 1b^4\\).

So, I need to consider the entire product. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Hmm, but the second part of the expression is in terms of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, does that mean the terms involving \\(c\\) won't affect the \\(a^2b^2\\) term? Let me think.\n\nWhen I multiply two expressions together, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression. So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I need to consider all the ways that \\(a^2b^2\\) can be multiplied by terms from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) such that the resulting term is still \\(a^2b^2\\). But wait, that doesn't make sense because \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\). So, actually, when I multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by any term from the second expression, it will just be \\(a^2b^2\\) times some power of \\(c\\). But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would imply that the power of \\(c\\) should be zero, right? Because if there's any \\(c\\) term, it won't be just \\(a^2b^2\\); it'll be \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some \\(k\\). So, maybe I need to find the term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) that has \\(c^0\\), which is the constant term, and then multiply it by the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part.\n\nWait, that makes sense.

So, I already found that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. Now, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nLet me apply the binomial theorem again to \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The expansion is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k\\). Simplifying that, each term becomes \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} c^{-k} = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, the exponent of \\(c\\) in each term is \\(6 - 2k\\). I need to find the term where the exponent is 0 because that's the constant term. So, set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is when \\(k = 3\\), and the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\).\n\nCalculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. \n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Wait, but let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. Is the term \\(a^2b^2\\) only affected by the constant term in the second expression? Because if I multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by any other term in the second expression, it would have a \\(c\\) component, which would make the term \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) instead of just \\(a^2b^2\\). Since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, I think that's correct. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider that the entire expression is a product of two polynomials, and when you multiply them, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second. So, for the term \\(a^2b^2\\), it can come from multiplying \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part by any term from the second part, but only the constant term in the second part will result in \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms. All other terms would introduce \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), which would change the term. So, yeah, I think I'm right that only the constant term in the second part matters here.\n\nLet me double-check the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\\). When \\(k = 0\\), it's \\(c^6\\); \\(k = 1\\), it's \\(6c^4\\); \\(k = 2\\), it's \\(15c^2\\); \\(k = 3\\), it's \\(20c^0\\); \\(k = 4\\), it's \\(15c^{-2}\\); \\(k = 5\\), it's \\(6c^{-4}\\); \\(k = 6\\), it's \\(c^{-6}\\). So, yes, the constant term is indeed 20.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the second part), which gives 120. Therefore, the answer should be 120.\n\nWait, just to make sure, let me think if there's another way this could be approached. Maybe using generating functions or multinomial coefficients? Hmm, but I think the approach I took is correct because I separated the two parts and considered that the term \\(a^2b^2\\) must come from the first part multiplied by the constant term from the second part. Since the variables are independent, their coefficients multiply when taking the product of the expressions. So, I think my reasoning is sound.\n\nI guess another way to look at it is that the entire expression is the product of two independent expansions, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) would be the product of the coefficients of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and \\(c^0\\) in the second part. So, yeah, 6 times 20 is 120. I think that's correct.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem.\n\nFirst, we expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n\\]\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in this expansion is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n\nNext, we need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).

The coefficient of this term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficients from the two parts:\n\\[\n6 \\times 20 = 120\n\\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

Or perhaps, more accurately, since we're looking for \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the powers of \\(c\\), the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. But wait, the second expansion isn't just a sum of coefficients; it's a sum of terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, actually, when we multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by the second expansion, we get terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) and \\(a^2b^2c^{-k}\\), but the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term without any \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\). So, that would mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is just 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion, because \\(c^0 = 1\\), which is the only term that doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\).\n\nWait, that makes sense. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part, which is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I need to find the constant term, the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nAlright, let me work on that. So, using the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k\\). Simplifying the exponents, that becomes \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} c^{-k} = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\).\n\nWe need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, so we set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(6 = 2k\\), so \\(k = 3\\). So, the term where \\(k = 3\\) is the constant term. The coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion is 20.\n\nTherefore, going back to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the second part), which is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). So, the coefficient is 120.\n\nWait, let me just double-check that. So, in the first expansion, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6. In the second expansion, the constant term is 20, so when we multiply those together, 6 times 20 is 120. That seems right. So, I think the answer is 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem.\n\nFirst, we expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n\\]\nThe term involving \\(a^2b^2\\) is:\n\\[\n\\dbinom{4}{2} a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\n\\]\nSo, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\nNext, we need to find the constant term (the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero) in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem:\n\\[\n\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n\\]\nWe need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, which occurs when \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(k = 3\\). The coefficient of this term is:\n\\[\n\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the product of the coefficients from each part:\n\\[\n6 \\times 20 = 120\n\\]\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}."

    "text": " Let me write that out.\n\nSo, \\((a + b)^4 = \\dbinom{4}{0}a^4b^0 + \\dbinom{4}{1}a^3b^1 + \\dbinom{4}{2}a^2b^2 + \\dbinom{4}{3}a^1b^3 + \\dbinom{4}{4}a^0b^4\\). Calculating the coefficients, that would be \\(1a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + 1b^4\\). Okay, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in this part is 6.\n\nBut wait, the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I think I need to consider how this multiplication affects the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Hmm, actually, since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), their coefficients shouldn't be directly affected by the terms involving \\(c\\). So, maybe the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just the same as in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, no, that doesn't seem right because when you multiply two expressions together, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and the second part involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), which don't contain \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would just be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), because \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\). So, maybe the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\).\n\nWait, but actually, no, that's not quite right. Because the entire expression is a product of two polynomials, and when you multiply them, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second. However, since we're only interested in the terms where the result has \\(a^2b^2\\), and the second polynomial doesn't have \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), those terms will just be \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But wait, that can't be right because that would make the coefficient a sum involving \\(c\\) terms, but we're supposed to find a numerical coefficient. Hmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding something.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), the coefficient in the product will be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each of those terms contributes a coefficient, and since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a scalar, the overall coefficient is just 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion.\n\nWait, but how do I find the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\)? The sum of the coefficients in a polynomial is found by plugging in \\(c = 1\\). So, if I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(1 + 1/1\\right)^6 = (2)^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 64.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 times 64, which is 384. Wait, that seems high. Let me check again.\n\nWait, no, actually, that's not correct. Because when you multiply two expressions, the coefficients don't just multiply by the sum of the coefficients of the other expression. Instead, each term in the first expression is multiplied by each term in the second expression, and when you're looking for a specific term, like \\(a^2b^2\\), it's only multiplied by the terms in the second expression that don't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), which in this case, all terms in the second expression involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), so none of them involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is simply the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the entire second expression. But that can't be right because that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), but we're supposed to find a numerical coefficient. Hmm, perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nWait, maybe I misread the problem. Let me check again: it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not considering \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\). So, in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and the second part doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. But that doesn't make sense because the coefficient would then be a sum involving \\(c\\) terms. Wait, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. That would make more sense because otherwise, the coefficient would involve \\(c\\) terms.\n\nWait, let me re-examine the problem: it says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\" in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Hmm, so it's possible that the problem is considering the entire expression, which includes variables \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\), and it's asking for the coefficient of the term that has \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where \\(c\\) cancels out. That would make more sense because then the coefficient would be a numerical value.\n\nWait, maybe I should consider that. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but only the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero would contribute to \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\).\n\nSo, let's break it down:\n\n1. Find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which we've already determined is 6.\n\n2. Find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\).\n\nThen, multiply these two coefficients together to get the final coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire expression.\n\nOkay, so step 2: finding the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Let's use the binomial theorem again. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(1/c\\right)^k\\). Simplifying each term, that's \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} c^{-k}\\) which is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\).\n\nWe need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, so we set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\), which is 20.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire expression is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it might be 384, but that was when I considered the sum of all coefficients, which is different. But now, considering only the term where \\(c^0\\), it's 20, so 6 times 20 is 120. That seems more reasonable.\n\nLet me double-check: in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, when \\(k = 3\\), the exponent is \\(6 - 6 = 0\\), so that term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} c^0 = 20\\). So, yes, the coefficient is 20.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 times 20, which is 120.\n\nWait, but the problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", not \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). So, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). But in that case, the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because coefficients are constants. So, perhaps the problem is implicitly asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where \\(c\\) cancels out, making it a constant term.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is considering the entire expression as a polynomial in \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\), and \\(1/c\\), and it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). But that would mean that the coefficient is a sum of terms involving \\(c\\), which isn't a numerical coefficient. So, perhaps the problem is miswritten, or I'm misinterpreting it.\n\nWait, looking back at the problem: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" It's possible that the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, considering that the entire expression is a product, and thus each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because coefficients are numerical.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where \\(c\\) cancels out, so that the term is purely in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). That would make sense, and that's what I calculated earlier as 120.\n\nWait, perhaps I should confirm this by expanding the expression more carefully. Let's consider the entire expansion:\n\n\\((a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\).\n\n\\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} (1/c)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\).\n\nSo, when we multiply these two, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^{6 - 2k}\\) for each \\(k\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would require that the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. Therefore, we only consider the term where \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which is when \\(k = 3\\), as we found earlier. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is indeed \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, considering only the terms where \\(c\\) cancels out, is 120.\n\nWait, but if the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), without any condition on \\(c\\), then the coefficient would actually be a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense as a numerical coefficient. Therefore, I think the problem must be asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the entire expression as a product and is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). But in that case, the coefficient would be the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by the coefficient from the first expansion. But that would mean the coefficient is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 times 64, as we calculated earlier, giving 384. But that seems too large, and it's not considering the \\(c\\) terms. So, I think that's incorrect.\n\nWait, no, actually, if you consider that each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would indeed be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the entire second expansion. But that would mean that the coefficient is a sum over \\(c\\) terms, which isn't a numerical coefficient. Therefore, the only way the coefficient is numerical is if we're considering the term where \\(c\\) cancels out, i.e., \\(c^0\\). Therefore, I think the correct approach is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nSo, to recap:\n\n1. Coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\n2. Coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 20.\n\n3. Multiply them together: 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), then multiplying these coefficients together.\n\n1. Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\dbinom{4}{2}a^2b^2 + \\text{other terms}\n   \\]\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n\n2. Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem:\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n   \\]\n   The term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero occurs when \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\). The coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n\n3. Multiply the two coefficients:\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 20 = 120\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

I'm looking for the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2 because I need the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). That would be when \\(4 - k = 2\\) for \\(a\\), so \\(k = 2\\). Therefore, the term is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} a^{2}b^{2}\\). The binomial coefficient \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) is calculated as \\(\\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\\). So, the coefficient from the first part is 6.\n\nNow, the expression also has another part: \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I notice that this part doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), so when I multiply the two parts together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) will just be multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, actually, when multiplying two polynomials, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second. However, since I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and the second polynomial doesn't have \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), I think the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression will just be the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the entire second part. But that doesn't sound quite right because the second part might have multiple terms, but since they don't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), they just act as a scalar multiple when multiplied by the first part.\n\nWait, actually, no. Let me think again. When I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).

But that seems too broad because the second part has many terms. Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider that the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), when expanded, will have terms involving \\(c^k\\) and \\(c^{-k}\\) for \\(k\\) from 0 to 6. But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\), maybe the coefficient is just 6 multiplied by the sum of all terms in the second expansion. But that doesn't make sense because each term in the second expansion is a different power of \\(c\\), so when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), it would create multiple terms with \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) and \\(a^2b^2c^{-k}\\). But the problem just asks for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), without considering the \\(c\\) terms. So, perhaps the coefficient is just 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the question is asking for a numerical coefficient.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, that would mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the coefficient from the first part, 6, multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part, which is a sum of terms. But since the second part is a sum, the coefficient would actually be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. Wait, no, that's not right either because each term in the second expansion is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in the second expansion. But actually, the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), so \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but that seems too straightforward. Let me double-check. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable, so the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of the second part, which is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem didn't specify any constraints on \\(c\\), so maybe I'm supposed to consider the coefficient as a polynomial. But the problem is phrased as \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", which usually implies a numerical coefficient, not a polynomial. Therefore, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it, and the answer is simply 6 multiplied by the entire second expansion, but that would make the coefficient a polynomial, which doesn't make sense.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in my initial approach. Let me try again. The problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when you multiply these two expressions, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the first expansion, specifically from the term \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}a^2b^2\\), which is 6a\u00b2b\u00b2. Then, when multiplied by each term in the second expansion, which is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - k}\\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, each term in the product will be 6a\u00b2b\u00b2 multiplied by \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients from the second expansion. But wait, that would mean 6 times the sum of \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}\\) for \\(k\\) from 0 to 6. But the sum of \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}\\) from \\(k=0\\) to \\(6\\) is \\(2^6 = 64\\), so the coefficient would be 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nBut that seems high. Let me check: the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion is indeed \\(2^6 = 64\\), so 6 * 64 is 384. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 384. Alternatively, perhaps I'm correct, and the answer is 384.\n\nWait, but let me think again. If I have \\((a + b)^4\\) which gives me terms up to \\(a^4b^0\\), and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) which gives me terms like \\(c^6, c^4, c^2, 1, c^{-2}, c^{-4}, c^{-6}\\). When I multiply these together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each of these \\(c\\) terms, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6, a^2b^2c^4, etc.\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) exponents. So, in that case, the coefficient would indeed be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question and it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some specific \\(k\\), but the problem doesn't specify, so I think the correct interpretation is that it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which would be 384.\n\nWait, but another way to think about it is that when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in one polynomial is multiplied by the entire other polynomial. So, in this case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6, and when multiplied by the second part, which is a polynomial, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the entire second polynomial. But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, which doesn't make sense because coefficients are scalars. Therefore, perhaps the problem is only considering the part without the \\(c\\) terms, but that's not clear.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me try to approach it differently. Let me first compute the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6. Then, the second part is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). The entire product is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which seems odd. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times some specific power of \\(c\\), but since it's not specified, maybe the answer is 6 times the entire expansion, but that seems unlikely.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider that the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, so the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, which doesn't make sense because the question is asking for a numerical coefficient. Therefore, maybe the problem is miswritten, or perhaps I'm misunderstanding it.\n\nWait, another thought: perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\), which is 1. That would make sense because then the coefficient would be a number. So, in that case, I would need to find the term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) that has \\(c^0\\), which is when the exponent is zero. Let me find that.\n\nIn \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - k} \\times (1/c)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\\). We want the exponent of \\(c\\) to be zero, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}c^0 = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product would be 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, that makes more sense. So, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. But the problem as stated is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), without specifying \\(c\\). So, maybe the problem expects the answer to be 6 times the entire expansion of the second part, but that would be a polynomial, which doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only considering the part where \\(c\\) cancels out, so the coefficient is 120.\n\nWait, perhaps I should check the problem again. It says: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, it's just \\(a^2b^2\\), without any \\(c\\) terms. So, that would imply that the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which is 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that seems odd because usually, when someone asks for the coefficient of a term, they mean a numerical coefficient, not a polynomial. Therefore, perhaps the problem is intended to ask for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be 120.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it, and the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. But that seems too large, and perhaps not what the problem is asking for.\n\nWait, let me try to see if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), meaning that the term \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by any power of \\(c\\). In that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of the second part, which is 6*(c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15c^{-2} + 6c^{-4} + c^{-6}), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6c^6 + 36c^4 + 90c^2 + 120 + 90c^{-2} + 36c^{-4} + 6c^{-6}. But that's a polynomial, and the problem is asking for a coefficient, which is a number, so that can't be right.\n\nTherefore, perhaps the problem is intended to ask for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. Alternatively, maybe the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, but then the coefficient would be a polynomial, which doesn't make sense. So, perhaps the intended answer is 120, considering only the term where \\(c\\) cancels out.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable, but the coefficient would then be 6 times the entire second expansion. But that seems unlikely because the problem is probably expecting a numerical answer.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider that the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, and since the second part is a separate expansion, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6*64=384. But I'm not sure.\n\nWait, let me check the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, it's just \\(a^2b^2\\), without any \\(c\\) terms.

When you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in one polynomial is multiplied by the entire other polynomial. So, in this case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6, and when multiplied by the second part, which is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, which doesn't make sense because the question is asking for a numerical coefficient. Therefore, perhaps the problem is expecting me to consider only the constant term in the second expansion, which is 20, so 6*20=120.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider that the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, and since the second part is a separate expansion, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6*64=384. But I'm not sure.\n\nWait, another approach: perhaps the problem is simply to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then note that the second part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), is multiplied by it, but since it's a separate variable, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just 6 times the entire second expansion. But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, which is not a number. Therefore, perhaps the problem is intended to ask for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nWait, let me think about it differently. If I'm only asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, then the coefficient is 6 times the entire second expansion. But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, which doesn't make sense because coefficients are scalars. Therefore, perhaps the problem is miswritten, or I'm misunderstanding it.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be 120, as I calculated earlier. That seems more plausible because it's a numerical coefficient. Therefore, I think the answer is 120.\n\nWait, but let me confirm. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product comes from multiplying the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part by each term in the second part. So, each term in the second part is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^{6 - 2k}\\) would be 6 * \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}\\). But if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}\\) from \\(k=0\\) to \\(6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384. But if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it's 6 * \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\) = 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nSince the problem doesn't specify the power of \\(c\\), I think the intended answer is 120, assuming that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). Alternatively, if it's asking for the coefficient regardless of \\(c\\), it would be 384, but that seems less likely.\n\nWait, perhaps I should check the problem again. It says: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, it's only specifying \\(a^2b^2\\), not any specific power of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of the second part, which is a polynomial. But since the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, perhaps it's intended to consider only the constant term in the second expansion, leading to 120.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is simply expecting me to recognize that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, and that's it, but that seems too simplistic because the entire expression is the product of two expansions.\n\nWait, no, because when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6, a^2b^2c^4\\), etc. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 times the entire expansion of the second part, which is a polynomial, but the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, so perhaps the intended answer is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), so \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, 6 * 64 = 384. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 384. But that seems high, and I'm not sure if that's what the problem is asking for.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider that the problem is simply to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and then note that the second part is a separate expansion, so the coefficient remains 6. But that doesn't make sense because the entire expression is a product, so the coefficient would be multiplied by the second expansion.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Let me try to see what the problem is asking. It's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. So, when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term is the product of the coefficients of the respective terms in each polynomial. But in this case, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) only comes from the first polynomial, and it's multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the entire expansion of the second polynomial, which is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But since the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, perhaps it's intended to consider only the constant term in the second expansion, which is 20, leading to 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting me to recognize that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, and that's it, but that seems incorrect because the second part is part of the product.\n\nWait, perhaps I should think about it differently. The problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so let's consider the entire product:\n\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\left(\\sum_{i=0}^4 \\dbinom{4}{i}a^{4 - i}b^i\\right) \\times \\left(\\sum_{j=0}^6 \\dbinom{6}{j}c^{6 - j}\\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^j\\right)\n\\]\n\nSimplifying the second sum:\n\n\\[\n\\sum_{j=0}^6 \\dbinom{6}{j}c^{6 - 2j}\n\\]\n\nSo, when you multiply these two sums, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) will be the sum of all products where \\(4 - i = 2\\) and \\(i = 2\\), which gives us the term from the first sum as \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\\). Then, this term is multiplied by each term in the second sum, which is \\(\\sum_{j=0}^6 \\dbinom{6}{j}c^{6 - 2j}\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the entire second sum, which is 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. Therefore, perhaps the problem is intended to ask for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is simply to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384.

Therefore, perhaps the intended answer is 120, considering only the constant term in the second expansion.\n\nWait, I think I've spent enough time thinking through this. I'm going to conclude that the coefficient is 120 because that's the coefficient when \\(c\\) cancels out, making it a numerical value, which is likely what the problem is asking for.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6. Then, considering the term where \\(c\\) cancels out (i.e., \\(c^0\\)) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20.

I'm looking for the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2 because the problem asks for \\(a^2b^2\\). That means I need the term where \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). Let me check: if \\(4 - k = 2\\), then \\(k = 2\\). So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\\). So, the coefficient from the first part is 6.\n\nNow, the second part of the expression is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I'm not directly looking for a term here because the problem is about \\(a^2b^2\\), but I think I might need to consider this part as well because the entire expression is the product of \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Does that mean I can ignore the second part because it's multiplied by terms involving \\(c\\)? Hmm, maybe I don't need to consider the \\(c\\) terms because they don't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. Let me think about that.\n\nWait, no, actually, when you multiply two expressions together, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression. So, if I have a term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part, and then I multiply it by each term from the second part, which is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), then the product will have terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) and \\(a^2b^2 \\cdot \\dfrac{1}{c^k}\\) for various \\(k\\). But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would mean the terms where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out, right? Because otherwise, if there's a \\(c\\) term, it wouldn't just be \\(a^2b^2\\); it would be \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or something else.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me read the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, perhaps they just want the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. That is, when you multiply the two expressions together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by every term in the second expression, but the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. But that doesn't make sense because then it would be a sum over all possible coefficients from the second part. Wait, no, that's not right.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. Let me think again. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when you expand this, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, for example, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from \\((a + b)^4\\) would be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which would give terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), etc. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). That is, the term where the exponents of \\(c\\) are zero, right? Because \\(a^2b^2\\) alone would have \\(c^0\\). So, perhaps I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) and then multiply it by the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part.\n\nWait, that makes sense. Because when you multiply the two expansions, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part will be multiplied by each term from the second part, but only the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero will contribute to the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the final product. All other terms would have some power of \\(c\\), so they wouldn't be just \\(a^2b^2\\). So, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nAlright, let me work on that. Let's expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem. So, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k\\). Simplifying each term, that's \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} c^{-k} = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\).\n\nWe're looking for the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, so we set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(6 = 2k\\) so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\).\n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part is 20. Now, going back to the original problem, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part has a coefficient of 6, and the term \\(c^0\\) from the second part has a coefficient of 20. Since these two terms are multiplied together in the product, the overall coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake here. So, the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6, because \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Then, in the second part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term with \\(c^0\\) is when \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which is at \\(k = 3\\), and the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, multiplying these together, 6 times 20 is 120. That seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of it as the entire product being \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), and when looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), it's the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and the sum of all coefficients in the second part. But no, that's not right because each term in the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all coefficients from the second part. Wait, but that's not correct either because the second part is not a polynomial in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), it's in \\(c\\). So, maybe I'm overcomplicating it.\n\nWait, perhaps another approach: when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each polynomial. But in this case, since the second polynomial is in a different variable, \\(c\\), the only way the \\(c\\) terms don't interfere is if we're only considering terms where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out, i.e., \\(c^0\\). So, in this case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is indeed the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second polynomial. So, 6 times 20 is 120.\n\nWait, but let me check if that's correct. Let me think of a simpler example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, expanding, \\((a + b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2\\), and \\((c + 1/c) = c + 1/c\\). So, the product is \\(a^2c + a^2/c + 2abc + 2ab/c + b^2c + b^2/c\\). Now, if I look for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but in this product, there's no \\(a^2b^2\\) term because the second polynomial only has \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), so when multiplied by \\(a^2\\), you get \\(a^2c\\) and \\(a^2/c\\), but no \\(a^2b^2\\). So, in this case, the coefficient would be zero. But according to my earlier method, the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) in the first part is 1, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part is zero because \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^1\\) doesn't have a \\(c^0\\) term. So, 1 times 0 is 0, which matches. So, that seems correct.\n\nAnother test: \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^2\\). Let's compute this. \\((a + b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2\\). \\((c + 1/c)^2 = c^2 + 2 + 1/c^2\\). Now, the product is \\(a^2c^2 + 2a^2 + a^2/c^2 + 2abc^2 + 4ab + 2ab/c^2 + b^2c^2 + 2b^2 + b^2/c^2\\). Now, looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but in this product, there's no \\(a^2b^2\\) term because the second polynomial doesn't have any \\(b\\) terms. Wait, but actually, in the product, the only terms with \\(a^2\\) are multiplied by terms from the second polynomial, which are in \\(c\\), so \\(a^2\\) times \\(c^2\\) is \\(a^2c^2\\), and \\(a^2\\) times 2 is \\(2a^2\\), and so on. But \\(a^2b^2\\) would require a term in the second polynomial that has \\(b^2\\), but the second polynomial doesn't have any \\(b\\) terms. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is zero. According to my method, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is zero because \\((a + b)^2\\) doesn't have an \\(a^2b^2\\) term. So, 0 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part (which is 2) would be zero, which is correct. So, that seems to check out.\n\nWait, but in my original problem, the first part does have an \\(a^2b^2\\) term, so I need to make sure that the second part contributes correctly. So, in my original problem, the coefficient is 6 times 20, which is 120. That seems correct.\n\nWait, but let me think again: when you multiply two polynomials, each term from the first polynomial is multiplied by each term from the second polynomial. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by each term from the second part, which are all terms involving \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\). So, the product would have terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), \\(a^2b^2c^2\\), \\(a^2b^2\\), \\(a^2b^2/c^2\\), etc. So, the only term that is just \\(a^2b^2\\) is when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, which is the term where \\(k=3\\) in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which has a coefficient of 20. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 times 20, which is 120.\n\nWait, but another way to think about it is that the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), and when you expand this, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the product of the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first part and the constant term (c^0) in the second part. So, the coefficient is indeed 6 times 20, which is 120.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of the entire product as separate variables, but I don't think that's necessary here. I think my reasoning is solid. So, I think the coefficient is 120.\n\nWait, but just to be thorough, let me compute the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) and confirm that the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is indeed 20.\n\nExpanding \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\times (1/c)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), so \\(k = 3\\). So, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\), as I found earlier. So, that's correct.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 times 20, which is 120. So, I think that's the answer.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me think of another approach. Maybe using generating functions or something else. Alternatively, perhaps using multinomial coefficients, but I don't think that's necessary here because the variables are separate.\n\nWait, another thought: since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and the other variable \\(c\\) is involved, maybe the problem is expecting me to consider that the entire expression is a product, and that the \\(a^2b^2\\) term is multiplied by all possible terms from the second polynomial, but only the term where \\(c^0\\) would contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. So, again, it's 6 times 20, which is 120.\n\nI think I've checked this thoroughly. So, I'm confident that the coefficient is 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem for both parts of the expression.\n\n1. **Expanding \\((a + b)^4\\):**\n   Using the binomial theorem, we have:\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\), so the coefficient is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\n   \\]\n\n2. **Expanding \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   Using the binomial theorem, we have:\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n   \\]\n   We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, i.e., \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(k = 3\\). The coefficient is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\n   \\]\n\n3. **Combining the results:**\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the product of the coefficients from each part:\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 20 = 120\n   \\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

Calculating the coefficients, that's \\(1 \\cdot a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + 1b^4\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in this part is 6. \n\nBut wait, the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I need to consider how that affects the coefficient. Let me think. Since we're multiplying two expressions together, each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nBut I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, in the product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will come from the \\(6a^2b^2\\) term in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). However, when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by terms involving \\(c\\), the resulting terms will have \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by some power of \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression. Wait, but in the entire expression, \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are only in the first part, and \\(c\\) is only in the second part. So, actually, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term is being multiplied by various powers of \\(c\\), but the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) itself would be the sum of all the coefficients from the second part multiplied by 6.\n\nWait, no, let me clarify. When you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum of the products of the coefficients of terms whose variables multiply to give that specific term. But in this case, \\(a^2b^2\\) is only present in the first polynomial, and the second polynomial only has terms with \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second polynomial, you'll get terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) where \\(k\\) is some exponent. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would only be the coefficient when the term is \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by 1, right? Because if you have \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by \\(c^k\\), that term would be \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), which is a different term. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the coefficient of 1 (i.e., \\(c^0\\)) in the second part.\n\nWait, but the second part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, let me expand that part as well. Using the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero would be when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which implies \\(m = 3\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the coefficient from the second part when \\(c^0\\) is taken, which is 20. So, 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake here. Because when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the sum of all the products where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any term in the second polynomial. But actually, no, because \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term in the first polynomial, and when you multiply it by each term in the second polynomial, you get \\(a^2b^2 \\times\\) (each term in the second polynomial). So, each of these products will have \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by a term involving \\(c\\). Therefore, the only way for the product to have just \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms is if we multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by the constant term (i.e., \\(c^0\\)) in the second polynomial. So, yes, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of it as the entire expression being the product of two polynomials, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial. Wait, no, that's not quite right. The sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial would be when \\(c = 1\\), but that's not directly relevant here.\n\nWait, no, let me correct that. The sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial is indeed when \\(c = 1\\), which would be \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). But that's not what we need here. We need the coefficient of \\(c^0\\), which is 20, as I calculated earlier. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but another way to think about it is: when you have two independent variables, the coefficients multiply. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part is 20, so when you multiply them, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is multiplied by the constant term in the second part, resulting in \\(a^2b^2\\) with coefficient 6*20=120.\n\nI think that's correct. Let me double-check my steps:\n\n1. Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is 6.\n2. Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n3. Multiply these coefficients together: 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nYes, that seems right. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem.\n\nFirst, we expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n\\]\nThe term containing \\(a^2b^2\\) is:\n\\[\n\\dbinom{4}{2} a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\n\\]\nSo, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in this part is 6.\n\nNext, we expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem:\n\\[\n\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n\\]\nThe term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero (i.e., \\(c^0\\)) occurs when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which gives \\(m = 3\\).

That means I have to multiply the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) by the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But the question is only about the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, maybe I don't need to worry about the other terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) because they won't affect the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. Let me think.\n\nWhen I multiply two polynomials, each term in the first polynomial gets multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. So, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by every term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since the question is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that only involves \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), the coefficients from the \\(c\\) terms will just be multiplied by 1 (since \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) are separate variables). Wait, no, actually, when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, you'll get terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2 \\cdot c^{-k}\\), but the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) itself would only come from the constant term in the second expansion, right? Because if you have \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by 1 (the constant term), that's just \\(a^2b^2\\). If you multiply it by \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), you'll get terms with \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), which are different from \\(a^2b^2\\). So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part. Is that correct?\n\nWait, let me check that. If I have \\((a + b)^4\\) times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), then when I expand it, each term from \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) multiplied by \\(c^6\\) would give \\(6a^2b^2c^6\\), and similarly, multiplied by \\(c^5 \\cdot 1/c = c^4\\), etc. But the only term that would result in a term without any \\(c\\) is when it's multiplied by the constant term in the second expansion. Because the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is when the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out, i.e., when the power of \\(c\\) is zero.\n\nSo, to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). That makes sense because when you multiply \\(6a^2b^2\\) by the constant term, you get \\(6a^2b^2\\), which is the term we're interested in. If we multiply by any other term, we'll get terms with \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), which won't be \\(a^2b^2\\).\n\nSo, first, I already found that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. Now, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Let's work on that.\n\nAgain, using the binomial theorem for \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which can be written as \\(\\left(c + c^{-1}\\right)^6\\). The expansion would be:\n\n\\[\n\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\cdot (c^{-1})^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\cdot c^{-k} = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n\\]\n\nWe need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, so we set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\):\n\n\\[\n6 - 2k = 0 \\\\\n2k = 6 \\\\\nk = 3\n\\]\n\nSo, the term where \\(k = 3\\) is the constant term. The coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\).\n\nCalculating \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\):\n\n\\[\n\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3! \\cdot (6 - 3)!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\cdot 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\n\\]\n\nWait, that can't be right because \\(6! = 720\\), but \\(3! = 6\\), so \\(720 / (6 * 6) = 720 / 36 = 20\\). Yes, that's correct. So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the two coefficients: 6 (from \\(a^2b^2\\)) and 20 (from \\(c^0\\)), which is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake here. So, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the only way to get a term that's just \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms is to multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by the constant term in the second expansion. So, yes, that would mean the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120. That seems right.\n\nBut just to double-check, maybe I should consider an alternative approach. Perhaps I can think about the entire expression as a product of two separate expansions and see if the coefficient is indeed 120.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can consider the multinomial theorem, but I think the binomial approach is sufficient here.\n\nWait, another thought: when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficients multiply for the terms that have the same variables. So, in this case, since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is by multiplying \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first polynomial with the constant term from the second polynomial.

So, maybe I don't need to worry about the \\(c\\) terms at all, because the problem isn't asking for a specific term involving \\(c\\), just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that exists in the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), multiplied by whatever comes from the second part.\n\nWait, but that might not be correct. Let me think again. The entire expression is a product of two parts: \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, when you multiply them, each term in the expansion will be a product of a term from the first part and a term from the second part. So, for example, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of the second part. But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), that is, the coefficient of the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present, regardless of the power of \\(c\\). Wait, no, that's not correct because the term \\(a^2b^2\\) itself doesn't involve \\(c\\), so when multiplied by any term from the second expression, it will have some power of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would actually be the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. Wait, no, that can't be right because the second part is being multiplied by the first part, so each term in the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me clarify. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, when you multiply the two expressions together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of the second part. So, for each term in the second part, say \\(c^k\\) or \\(c^{-k}\\), when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), you get \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2c^{-k}\\). But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would include all terms where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2, regardless of the exponent of \\(c\\). Wait, but that's not possible because each term in the product will have some power of \\(c\\), so the term \\(a^2b^2\\) itself is not present unless multiplied by \\(c^0\\), which is 1.\n\nWait, that makes sense. So, the only way to get a term with \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) is if the second part contributes a term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, i.e., \\(c^0 = 1\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part. That is, \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\).\n\nSo, first, let's compute \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\), which is 6, as I found earlier. Now, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Let me expand this using the binomial theorem as well. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\times (1/c)^m\\). Simplifying the exponents, that becomes \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m - m} = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\).\n\nWe need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so we set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\).\n\nCalculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). Wait, actually, that's not correct because 6! is 720, but 3! is 6, so 6!/(3!3!) = 720/(6\u00d76) = 720/36 = 20. So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the second part), which is 6 \u00d7 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but let me double-check that. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first part with coefficient 6, and the term \\(c^0\\) comes from the second part with coefficient 20, so when you multiply these together, you get 6 \u00d7 20 = 120 as the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is \\(a^2b^2\\). So, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, if I think of the entire expression as a product, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the product of the coefficients of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and the constant term in the second part. Since the second part's constant term is 20, and the first part's coefficient is 6, the total coefficient is 120.\n\nLet me make sure I didn't make a mistake in calculating the binomial coefficients. For \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\), that's 6, which is correct because 4 choose 2 is 6. For \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\), that's 20, which is also correct because 6 choose 3 is 20. So, 6 \u00d7 20 is indeed 120.\n\nWait, but just to be thorough, let me expand the second part a bit more. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) would have terms like:\n\n- When m=0: \\(\\dbinom{6}{0}c^6 = 1 \\times c^6\\)\n- When m=1: \\(\\dbinom{6}{1}c^4 = 6c^4\\)\n- When m=2: \\(\\dbinom{6}{2}c^2 = 15c^2\\)\n- When m=3: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}c^0 = 20\\)\n- When m=4: \\(\\dbinom{6}{4}c^{-2} = 15c^{-2}\\)\n- When m=5: \\(\\dbinom{6}{5}c^{-4} = 6c^{-4}\\)\n- When m=6: \\(\\dbinom{6}{6}c^{-6} = 1c^{-6}\\)\n\nSo, yes, the term where m=3 gives the constant term, which is 20. So, that's correct.\n\nTherefore, putting it all together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 \u00d7 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me think again: when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part. But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a specific term, we have to consider that \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, leading to terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), \\(a^2b^2c^2\\), \\(a^2b^2\\), \\(a^2b^2c^{-2}\\), etc. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2 and the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0. So, that term is \\(a^2b^2\\) times the constant term from the second part, which is 20. Therefore, the coefficient is indeed 6 \u00d7 20 = 120.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem had asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^2\\), that would be a different story, but since it's only \\(a^2b^2\\), we're only looking for the term where \\(c\\) is raised to the 0 power. So, that's why we multiply the coefficients from each part where the exponents of \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) match the desired term.\n\nWait, but another way to think about it is that the entire expression is a product, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the sum over all possible ways to get \\(a^2b^2\\) when multiplying terms from each part. But in this case, since \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the first part, and the second part must contribute a term that doesn't affect \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), which is only the constant term. So, that's why it's just the product of the two coefficients.\n\nI think that makes sense. So, I'm confident that the coefficient is 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem.\n\nFirst, consider the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n\\]\nThe term with \\(a^2b^2\\) occurs when \\(k = 2\\), so the coefficient is:\n\\[\n\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\n\\]\n\nNext, consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem:\n\\[\n\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n\\]\nWe need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, which occurs when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(m = 3\\). The coefficient is:\n\\[\n\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\n\\]\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficients from each part:\n\\[\n6 \\times 20 = 120\n\\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}."

Now, I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is clearly 6. But wait, the original problem is \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I think I need to multiply this expansion by the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Hmm, but do I need to multiply all the terms or just the specific term I'm interested in?\n\nLet me think. Since I'm only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), maybe I don't need to worry about the terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). Because when I multiply, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first expansion will multiply each term of the second expansion, but since the problem doesn't specify anything about \\(c\\), perhaps the coefficient remains the same? Wait, that doesn't seem right. Maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem.\n\nWait, let me read the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, actually, the entire expression is a product of two binomials, each raised to a power. So, when I expand the entire expression, I need to find the coefficient for the term \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). That means that term \\(a^2b^2\\) can be multiplied by any term from the second expansion, but since the question only asks for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, I think I just need to consider the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and then see if it's multiplied by any constant or something in the second part.\n\nWait, but actually, when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficients multiply. So, if I have a term \\(6a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion and then multiply by each term in the second expansion, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be \\(6\\) times the sum of all the coefficients in the second expansion. But that doesn't make sense because the second expansion has terms with different powers of \\(c\\), which are separate variables. So, maybe the \\(a^2b^2\\) term is multiplied by the entire second expansion, but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient would just be 6 times the sum of the coefficients of all terms in the second expansion.\n\nWait, but that doesn't sound right because each term in the second expansion is multiplied by the \\(a^2b^2\\) term, so the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. But I'm not sure if that's correct because the question might actually be asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without considering the \\(c\\) terms, meaning that the coefficient is just 6, regardless of the \\(c\\) part. Hmm, I'm a bit confused.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product. So, in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), when we expand it, we get terms like \\(a^kb^{4 - k} \\times c^m \\times \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^n\\), which simplifies to \\(a^kb^{4 - k}c^{m - n}\\). But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, that means we need to find all terms in the product where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2 each, and then sum their coefficients.\n\nSo, in other words, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the sum over all possible exponents \\(m\\) and \\(n\\) in the second expansion such that when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), we still have \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, but since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), their exponents don't affect the exponents of \\(c\\). So, actually, every term in the first expansion will multiply the entire second expansion, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion multiplied by the entire second expansion. But that would mean the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion.\n\nWait, but that can't be right because the second expansion has terms with different powers of \\(c\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, because each term in the second expansion is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), contributing 6 times each coefficient. But I'm not sure if that's correct because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, perhaps the answer is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion.\n\nWait, let me test this idea. Let's say I have \\((a + b)^4 = A\\), and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = B\\). Then, the product is \\(A \\times B\\). The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(A\\) is 6, as we found earlier. Now, when we multiply \\(A\\) by \\(B\\), each term in \\(A\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(B\\). So, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) in \\(A\\) will be multiplied by each term in \\(B\\), resulting in terms like \\(6a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(6a^2b^2c^4\\), etc., up to \\(6a^2b^2 \\times 1/c^6\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, in the entire product, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(B\\), because each term in \\(B\\) contributes a coefficient when multiplied by \\(6a^2b^2\\).\n\nWait, but the sum of all coefficients in \\(B\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\). So, let me calculate that. The sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is when \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of all coefficients in \\(B\\) is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\(A \\times B\\) would be 6 times 64, which is 384. So, is the answer 384?\n\nWait, but that seems too straightforward. Let me check if that's correct. Alternatively, maybe I should consider that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just 6, and since it's multiplied by each term in \\(B\\), the total contribution to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in \\(B\\), which is indeed 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Maybe the question is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where the exponents of \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are 2, 2, and 0, respectively. But the problem doesn't specify anything about \\(c\\), so I think it's just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(B\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me think again. When you multiply two polynomials, the coefficients multiply. So, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial will multiply each term in the second polynomial, which is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Each term in the second polynomial is of the form \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - k}(1/c)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, the coefficient for each term in the second polynomial is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}\\), and the exponent of \\(c\\) is \\(6 - 2k\\).\n\nNow, when we multiply \\(6a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second polynomial, we get terms like \\(6 \\times \\dbinom{6}{k} a^2b^2c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, for each \\(k\\), we have a term where the coefficient is \\(6 \\times \\dbinom{6}{k}\\), and the exponents are \\(a^2b^2c^{6 - 2k}\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in the entire product, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the sum of all \\(6 \\times \\dbinom{6}{k}\\) for \\(k = 0\\) to \\(6\\). So, that's 6 times the sum of \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}\\) from \\(k = 0\\) to \\(6\\).\n\nBut the sum of \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}\\) from \\(k = 0\\) to \\(6\\) is \\(2^6 = 64\\), as we saw earlier. So, 6 times 64 is indeed 384. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 384.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. Another way to think about it is that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the product of the coefficients of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and the sum of the coefficients in the second part. Since the second part is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which has a sum of coefficients equal to 64, then the total coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem had specified a particular power of \\(c\\), say \\(c^0\\), then we would have needed to find the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, which would require \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), so \\(k = 3\\), and then the coefficient would be \\(6 \\times \\dbinom{6}{3} = 6 \\times 20 = 120\\). But since the problem doesn't specify anything about \\(c\\), I think the answer is 384.\n\nWait, but let me check the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, it's just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. Therefore, the coefficient would be the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit unsure because sometimes when you have multiple variables, you have to consider cross terms, but in this case, since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), their coefficients are independent. So, I think my reasoning is correct.\n\nSo, to summarize:\n\n1. Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is 6.\n\n2. Recognize that this term is then multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which has a sum of coefficients equal to 64 when \\(c = 1\\).\n\n3. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nSo, I think the answer is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is found by first determining the coefficient in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplying it by the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is \\(2^6 = 64\\). Thus, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n\\boxed{384}"

But that doesn't make sense because then it would be a polynomial multiplied by another polynomial, but the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. But that seems too large and probably not the intended interpretation.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)\". So, actually, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is only from the first part, and the second part is just another polynomial.

Therefore, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term from the second part, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for various exponents \\(k\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would imply that we are only considering the coefficient regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, perhaps we need to sum over all possible coefficients from the second expansion, but that doesn't make sense because each term from the second expansion would multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term, making the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) as 6 times the coefficient from the second expansion. But the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), without any specific \\(c\\) term, which is a bit confusing because in the product, \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by the entire second polynomial, leading to terms with different powers of \\(c\\). \n\nWait, perhaps the problem is miswritten, and they actually mean the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would make more sense. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, but that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. Let me check that.\n\nWait, the second part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me expand that part to see what its coefficients are. Using the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\), where \\(m\\) ranges from 0 to 6. The coefficients are \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\) and the exponents of \\(c\\) are \\(6 - 2m\\).\n\nNow, going back to the original problem: when we multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, resulting in terms like \\(6a^2b^2 \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^{6 - 2m}\\) would be \\(6 \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a bit ambiguous because \\(a^2b^2\\) is just a term in the product, but in reality, each term is \\(a^2b^2c^{k}\\) for some exponent \\(k\\). So, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), which would mean summing over all possible coefficients from the second expansion. That is, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion.\n\nWait, but the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\). So, \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, if we sum all coefficients in the second expansion, we get 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). But that seems too straightforward, and I'm not sure if that's what the problem is asking.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), that is, the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2 and 2 respectively, and the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0. That would make more sense because otherwise, the coefficient would be the same for all terms with \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), which isn't typically how such problems are structured. So, let me assume that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2 and 2, and the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0.\n\nIf that's the case, then we need to find the term in the second expansion where \\(c^0\\), which occurs when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), so \\(m = 3\\). So, the coefficient from the second expansion when \\(m = 3\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficients from each part, which is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nWait, but I'm not sure if the problem is asking for \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\) or specifically \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). Let me check the problem statement again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)\". It doesn't specify anything about \\(c\\), so perhaps it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, treating \\(c\\) as another variable. But in that case, the coefficient would be the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire second expansion, which would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. As I calculated earlier, the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion is 64, so 6 times 64 is 384. But that seems quite large, and I'm not sure if that's the intended interpretation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when considering all possible terms, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. But in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 384. However, I think that's not the case because usually, when a problem asks for the coefficient of a specific term in a product of expressions, they're referring to the term where the exponents match exactly, not summed over all possible exponents of other variables.\n\nWait, another approach: perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating \\(c\\) as a variable, so that \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), meaning that we need to find the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\). That would make sense because otherwise, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by various powers of \\(c\\), and the coefficient would vary depending on the power of \\(c\\). So, to have a term that is just \\(a^2b^2\\), the exponent of \\(c\\) must be zero. Therefore, the coefficient would be the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part.\n\nSo, as I calculated earlier, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). So, that would be the answer.\n\nBut just to make sure, let me think again. The problem says: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)\". If we interpret this as finding the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then the answer would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. However, if we interpret it as finding the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it's 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nI think the more likely intended interpretation is the latter, that is, finding the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), because otherwise, the problem would be asking for a coefficient that's spread across multiple terms with different powers of \\(c\\), which isn't typically how such problems are phrased. So, I think the answer is 120.\n\nWait, but let me check the problem again. It just says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", without specifying anything about \\(c\\). So, in the product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by the entire second expansion, which includes terms with various powers of \\(c\\). Therefore, in the product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would appear multiplied by each term from the second expansion, resulting in terms like \\(6a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(6a^2b^2c^4\\), etc., down to \\(6a^2b^2c^{-6}\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is actually 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but that would mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 384, but that seems to ignore the fact that \\(a^2b^2\\) is being multiplied by different powers of \\(c\\). So, perhaps the problem is indeed asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. Alternatively, maybe the problem is miswritten, and it's supposed to be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), but it's written as \\(a^2b^2\\). Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which would be 384.\n\nHmm, this is a bit confusing. Let me think about how the problem is structured. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, it's a product of two separate binomial expansions. Each term in the product will be of the form \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}a^{4 - k}b^k \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would correspond to \\(k = 2\\) in the first part, and for the second part, \\(m\\) can be any value from 0 to 6, resulting in different powers of \\(c\\). Therefore, in the entire product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term from the second expansion, leading to terms like \\(6a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(6a^2b^2c^4\\), etc., each with their own coefficients. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is actually 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nBut that seems a bit odd because usually, when you're asked for the coefficient of a specific term, it's in the context of all variables. So, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. Alternatively, maybe the problem is miswritten, and they meant to include \\(c^0\\) or something else.\n\nWait, another way to think about it: if we treat \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) as separate variables, then the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term where \\(c\\) is not present, which would correspond to \\(c^0\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nAlternatively, if we treat \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) as separate variables, then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the sum of all coefficients of terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present, regardless of the power of \\(c\\). But that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 384.\n\nBut I think the more standard interpretation is that when you're asked for the coefficient of a specific term in a product of polynomials, you're supposed to consider the term where the exponents match exactly, meaning that if the term in the first polynomial is \\(a^2b^2\\), then in the second polynomial, you need the term where \\(c\\) is raised to the power that makes the overall term \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), but without any specific \\(k\\), it's ambiguous.\n\nWait, but in the problem, it's written as \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), so perhaps the variables \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are all independent, and the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be a term where \\(c\\) is not present, i.e., \\(c^0\\). Therefore, the coefficient would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion, which is 20, so 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nYes, that makes sense because if you're looking for the term \\(a^2b^2\\), you want the term where \\(c\\) is not present, so you need the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion, which is 20, and then multiply by the coefficient from the first expansion, which is 6, giving 120.\n\nTherefore, I think the answer is 120.\n\nWait, to double-check, let's think about how the expansion works. The first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), has a term \\(6a^2b^2\\). The second part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), has a term \\(20c^0\\). When you multiply these two, you get \\(6a^2b^2 \\times 20c^0 = 120a^2b^2c^0\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is 120. Since the problem didn't specify anything about \\(c\\), but just asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), it's reasonable to assume that they want the term where \\(c\\) is not present, i.e., \\(c^0\\). Therefore, the coefficient is 120.\n\nAlternatively, if they had asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some specific \\(k\\), that would be a different story. But as it stands, I think the answer is 120.\n\nSo, to summarize:\n\n1. Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6.\n2. Expand \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem. The coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n3. Multiply these two coefficients together: \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n4. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) (assuming \\(c^0\\)) is 120.\n\nI think that makes sense.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we proceed as follows:\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem**:\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term containing \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\):\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2}a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\n   \\]\n   So, the coefficient is 6.\n\n2. **Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem**:\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n   \\]\n   The term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0 (i.e., \\(c^0\\)) occurs when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which gives \\(m = 3\\):\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{6}{3}c^0 = 20\n   \\]\n   So, the coefficient is 20.\n\n3. **Multiply the coefficients from both expansions**:\n   Since we are looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, and considering that \\(c^0\\) is the term where \\(c\\) does not affect the \\(a^2b^2\\) term, we multiply the two coefficients:\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 20 = 120\n   \\]\n\n**Answer**: The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

    "text": " Let me write that expansion out.\n\nSo, \\((a + b)^4 = \\dbinom{4}{0}a^4b^0 + \\dbinom{4}{1}a^3b^1 + \\dbinom{4}{2}a^2b^2 + \\dbinom{4}{3}a^1b^3 + \\dbinom{4}{4}a^0b^4\\). Calculating the binomial coefficients, that becomes \\(1a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + 1b^4\\). Okay, so if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), that's the middle term, which is 6. So, the coefficient from the first part is 6.\n\nNow, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I need to consider how this multiplication affects the coefficient. Wait, but I'm only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), right? So, actually, the terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) might not affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), because \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\). Hmm, let me think about that.\n\nWait, no, that's not quite right. The entire expression is a product of two polynomials, so each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are different variables, the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) will be multiplied by terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), but when we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), we need to consider all the terms in the second part that, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), will still result in a term that includes \\(a^2b^2\\). But wait, actually, since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are separate variables, any term involving \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\) will not affect the power of \\(a\\) or \\(b\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), right? Because when you multiply, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial, but since \\(c\\) is a different variable, the terms involving \\(c\\) don't affect the power of \\(a\\) or \\(b\\).\n\nWait, no, that doesn't sound quite right. Let me think again. If I have \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part, and I multiply it by any term from the second part, say \\(c^k\\) or \\(c^{-k}\\), then the resulting term would be \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2c^{-k}\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, but in the entire expression, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would only appear if it's multiplied by a term that's \\(c^0\\), because otherwise, the term would have \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\) in it. So, to get the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), and then multiply that by the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) from \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6.\n\nSo, first, let's find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). To do this, I can use the binomial theorem again. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k\\). Simplifying the exponents, that's \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} c^{-k} = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\).\n\nWe need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so we set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). Wait, that's not right. Let me calculate it correctly. 6! is 720, 3! is 6, so 720/(6*6) is 720/36, which is 20. So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20.\n\nNow, going back to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part is 20. Since these are multiplied together in the product, the overall coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, let me double-check that. So, \\((a + b)^4\\) gives \\(a^2b^2\\) with a coefficient of 6, and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) gives a constant term (c^0) with a coefficient of 20. So, when you multiply these two expansions together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by the constant term 20 from the second part, resulting in \\(20a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient is indeed 20 multiplied by 6, which is 120. Hmm, that seems correct.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not missing anything. The problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product of the two expressions. Since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are separate variables, the only way to get a term with \\(a^2b^2\\) is to take \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part and multiply it by a term that doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\) from the second part. So, that term must be the constant term in the second part, which is 20. Therefore, the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So, I think the coefficient is 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem for both parts of the expression.\n\nFirst, we expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n\\]\nThe term containing \\(a^2b^2\\) is:\n\\[\n\\dbinom{4}{2}a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\n\\]\nSo, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\nNext, we need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) (the constant term) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem again:\n\\[\n\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n\\]\nWe need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, which occurs when \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\) gives \\(k = 3\\). The coefficient is:\n\\[\n\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\n\\]\n\nFinally, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficients from each part:\n\\[\n6 \\times 20 = 120\n\\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}."

But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), the only way that can happen is if we multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term by the constant term (the term with \\(c^0\\)) in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).

The coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nOnce I have both coefficients, I can multiply them together to get the final coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression.\n\nSo, let's tackle the second part: finding the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Again, I can use the binomial theorem here. The binomial theorem states that \\((x + y)^n = \\sum_{k=0}^{n} \\dbinom{n}{k}x^{n - k}y^k\\). In this case, \\(x = c\\), \\(y = \\dfrac{1}{c}\\), and \\(n = 6\\).\n\nSo, expanding \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term will be \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - k}\\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k\\). Let me simplify that term. \\(\\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = c^{-k}\\), so the exponent on \\(c\\) becomes \\(6 - k - k = 6 - 2k\\).\n\nWe need the term where the exponent on \\(c\\) is 0, because that's the constant term. So, we set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\) and solve for \\(k\\):\n\n\\(6 - 2k = 0\\)\n\nSubtract 6 from both sides:\n\n\\(-2k = -6\\)\n\nDivide both sides by -2:\n\n\\(k = 3\\)\n\nSo, the term where \\(k = 3\\) will be the constant term. Let's compute that term.\n\nFirst, find the binomial coefficient \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). I remember that \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). Wait, let me check that again: 6! is 720, 3! is 6, so 720 divided by (6 \u00d7 6) is indeed 20. So, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n\nThen, the term is \\(20 \\times c^{6 - 3} \\times \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^3 = 20 \\times c^3 \\times c^{-3} = 20 \\times c^{0} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of the constant term \\(c^0\\) is 20.\n\nGreat, so now I have both coefficients:\n\n1. Coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n2. Coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20.\n\nNow, since the entire expression is the product of \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be the product of these two coefficients. That is, 6 multiplied by 20.\n\nCalculating that: 6 \u00d7 20 = 120.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is 120.\n\nWait, let me just double-check to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. So, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6. Then, in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the constant term is when the exponent is 0, which happens when \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), so \\(k = 3\\), and the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\), which is 20. Multiplying 6 and 20 gives 120. Yeah, that seems right.\n\nI don't think I made any calculation errors. So, I'm confident that the coefficient is 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem.\n\nFirst, we expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\dbinom{4}{0}a^4 + \\dbinom{4}{1}a^3b + \\dbinom{4}{2}a^2b^2 + \\dbinom{4}{3}ab^3 + \\dbinom{4}{4}b^4\n\\]\nCalculating the coefficients, we get:\n\\[\n1, 4, 6, 4, 1\n\\]\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\nNext, we need to find the coefficient of the constant term (i.e., \\(c^0\\)) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem, we expand:\n\\[\n\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n\\]\nWe need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, which occurs when \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(k = 3\\). The coefficient for this term is:\n\\[\n\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficients found:\n\\[\n6 \\times 20 = 120\n\\]\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}."

Calculating the binomial coefficients, that's \\(1a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + 1b^4\\). Okay, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6. But wait, the problem isn't just \\((a + b)^4\\), it's multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I can't just stop here. I need to consider the entire expression.\n\nHmm, so maybe I should expand both parts separately and then see how they multiply. But that seems complicated because both expansions have multiple terms. Wait, but I only need the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Maybe I don't need to expand the entire expression, just focus on the parts that contribute to \\(a^2b^2\\).\n\nLet me think. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When I multiply these two expansions together, each term from the first expansion will multiply each term from the second expansion. So, for the product to have a term with \\(a^2b^2\\), the term from the first part must be \\(a^2b^2\\) and the term from the second part can be any term because it doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\). Wait, actually, the second part is in terms of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), so it doesn't affect the powers of \\(a\\) or \\(b\\). So, maybe the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part, summed up? No, that doesn't make sense because when you multiply two polynomials, each term multiplies each term.\n\nWait, no. Let me clarify. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from multiplying the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first expansion by any term in the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Because each term in the second part is a constant (with respect to \\(a\\) and \\(b\\)), so when you multiply, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) will be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\).\n\nWait, is that correct? Let me think again. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6a\u00b2b\u00b2, and when you multiply it by any term in the second expansion, which is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), you'll get terms like 6a\u00b2b\u00b2c^k + 6a\u00b2b\u00b2c^{6 - k}, etc. But all of these terms will have \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by some power of \\(c\\), so the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product will indeed be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion because each term in the second expansion is multiplied by 6a\u00b2b\u00b2.\n\nBut wait, actually, no. Because the second expansion is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is a Laurent polynomial in \\(c\\). The sum of the coefficients in the second expansion would be found by setting \\(c = 1\\), because substituting \\(c = 1\\) makes \\(c + 1/c = 2\\), and \\(\\left(2\\right)^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of the coefficients is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but I'm not sure if that's correct. Let me verify. Alternatively, maybe I should consider that the second expansion doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But when we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\), it's just 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nBut wait, let me think again. When you have two separate variables, \\(a, b\\) and \\(c\\), the product will have terms that are products of terms from each expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first expansion multiplied by any term in the second expansion. So, the coefficient would be 6 (the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is indeed 64. So, 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, if I were to compute the entire product, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 multiplied by each term in the second expansion, but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\), it's just 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion.\n\nWait, but let me make sure. Let me compute the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). To find the sum of the coefficients, I can substitute \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\), as I thought earlier. So, yes, the sum is 64.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but another way to think about it is that when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in one polynomial is multiplied by all terms in the other polynomial. So, in this case, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term is 6a\u00b2b\u00b2, and when you multiply it by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), you get 6a\u00b2b\u00b2 times each term, which means that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64. So, 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Is that the correct approach? Because the second expansion has terms with different powers of \\(c\\), but since we're only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then yes, it's just 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem had asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some specific \\(k\\), then I would have to find the specific coefficient in the second expansion. But since it's just \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\), then it's 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion.\n\nSo, I think that's the correct approach. Therefore, the coefficient is 384.\n\nWait, but let me check my work again. Maybe I made a mistake in calculating the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion. Let me compute \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) when \\(c = 1\\). So, substituting \\(c = 1\\), we get \\((1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). That's correct.\n\nAnd the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is indeed 6, as calculated using the binomial coefficient \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n\nTherefore, multiplying these together gives 6 * 64 = 384. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 384.\n\nI think that's correct. So, the final answer is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplying it by the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The sum of the coefficients in the second expression is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), yielding \\(2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n\\boxed{384}"

    "text": " Let me expand that first.\n\nSo, expanding \\((a + b)^4\\), the expansion will have terms from \\(a^4\\) down to \\(b^4\\). Each term's coefficient is given by the binomial coefficient \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}\\) where \\(k\\) goes from 0 to 4. So, the general term is \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}a^{4 - k}b^k\\). Now, I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). That would be when \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\), right? So, let me compute that binomial coefficient.\n\nCalculating \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\), which is the number of ways to choose 2 items out of 4. The formula is \\(\\dbinom{n}{k} = \\dfrac{n!}{k!(n - k)!}\\). Plugging in the numbers, that's \\(\\dfrac{4!}{2!2!}\\). Calculating that: \\(4! = 24\\), \\(2! = 2\\), so it's \\(24 / (2*2) = 24/4 = 6\\). So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. Okay, so that part is done. I think that's straightforward.\n\nNow, the expression also has another part, which is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I need to consider this as well. But wait, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Hmm, so maybe the other part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. Let me think about that. Since \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) are separate variables from \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), when we multiply the two expansions together, the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) will be multiplied by terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). But since the question is only about the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), perhaps the coefficient is just 6 multiplied by whatever the constant term is in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because if there's a constant term, it won't introduce any additional \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\) factors, so it will just multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. Alternatively, if there are other terms, they might introduce \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), which would make the term not just \\(a^2b^2\\), but something like \\(a^2b^2c\\) or \\(a^2b^2/c\\), which aren't what we want. So, I think the only term that contributes to \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms is the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, i.e., the constant term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nTherefore, I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me expand that using the binomial theorem as well. So, the expansion is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying that, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m} = \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the exponent of \\(c\\) in each term is \\(6 - 2m\\). I want the exponent to be zero because that's the constant term. So, setting \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\) so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is when \\(m = 3\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} c^{0} = \\dbinom{6}{3}\\).\n\nCalculating \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\), that's \\(6! / (3!3!) = (720)/(6*6) = 720/36 = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20. Therefore, when I multiply the two expansions together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by 20 from the second part, giving me \\(6 * 20 = 120\\) as the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\).\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not missing anything here. So, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). When I expand both, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the first part, and to get a term without any \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), it must be multiplied by the constant term in the second expansion. So, the coefficient is indeed 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nBut just to double-check, let me think if there's another way this could happen. For example, could there be a term in the second expansion that has \\(c^1\\) and another that has \\(c^{-1}\\), so when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), it would result in \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is still \\(a^2b^2\\)? Wait, no, because each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, for \\(a^2b^2\\) to be multiplied by \\(c^1\\) and \\(c^{-1}\\), you would need both \\(c^1\\) and \\(c^{-1}\\) terms, but each term in the product is a single term, so you can't have two different terms multiplied together for the same product. So, the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms is to have it multiplied by the constant term in the second expansion. Therefore, my initial thought was correct, and the coefficient is 120.\n\nWait, but let me think again: when I expand \\((a + b)^4\\), I get terms like \\(a^4\\), \\(4a^3b\\), \\(6a^2b^2\\), \\(4ab^3\\), \\(b^4\\). Then, when I expand \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), I get terms like \\(c^6\\), \\(6c^4\\), \\(15c^2\\), \\(20\\), \\(15c^{-2}\\), \\(6c^{-4}\\), \\(c^{-6}\\). So, when I multiply these two expansions together, each term from the first is multiplied by each term from the second. So, for example, \\(a^4\\) would be multiplied by \\(c^6\\), \\(6c^4\\), etc., giving terms like \\(a^4c^6\\), \\(6a^4c^4\\), etc. Similarly, \\(6a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion would be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, resulting in terms like \\(6a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(36a^2b^2c^4\\), \\(90a^2b^2c^2\\), \\(120a^2b^2\\), \\(90a^2b^2c^{-2}\\), \\(36a^2b^2c^{-4}\\), \\(6a^2b^2c^{-6}\\). So, among all these terms, the only one that is \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms is \\(120a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient is indeed 120.\n\nWait, so that seems to confirm my earlier conclusion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can approach this problem differently. Let me consider the entire expression as a product of two independent expansions. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part is 20. Since these are independent, when you multiply the two expressions together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\) is 6 * 20 = 120. So, that also gives me the same answer.\n\nWait, but just to be thorough, let me make sure that there's no other combination where a term from the first expansion could combine with a term from the second expansion to give \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms. For example, could a term with \\(a^3b\\) from the first expansion multiply with a term from the second expansion that has \\(c^{-1}\\) to somehow give \\(a^2b^2\\)? No, because when you multiply \\(a^3b\\) by \\(c^{-1}\\), you get \\(a^3b c^{-1}\\), which is not \\(a^2b^2\\). Similarly, any term in the first expansion with a different power of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) can't combine with a term in the second expansion to give exactly \\(a^2b^2\\) because the second expansion only affects \\(c\\) terms, not \\(a\\) or \\(b\\). So, the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) is to take the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first expansion and multiply it by the constant term from the second expansion. Therefore, 6 * 20 = 120 is indeed the correct coefficient.\n\nI think I've considered this from multiple angles and each time I come back to 120 as the coefficient. So, I feel confident that 120 is the right answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem.\n\nFirst, we expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n\\]\nThe term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\). The coefficient is given by:\n\\[\n\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\n\\]\n\nNext, we consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):\n\\[\n\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n\\]\nWe need the constant term, which occurs when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero:\n\\[\n6 - 2m = 0 \\implies m = 3\n\\]\nThe constant term is:\n\\[\n\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\n\\]\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is the product of the coefficients found:\n\\[\n6 \\times 20 = 120\n\\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}."

But wait, that's only the first part of the expression. The entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I need to consider how this multiplication affects the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). \n\nI think the key here is that when you multiply two expressions together, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression.

Actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be the sum of all the coefficients from the second expression multiplied by 6, because each term in the second expression when multiplied by \\(6a^2b^2\\) would contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. But hold on, no, that doesn't sound right. Because the second expression is a polynomial in \\(c\\), and we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, actually, every term in the second expression when multiplied by \\(6a^2b^2\\) will result in a term that has \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by some power of \\(c\\). But the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), without considering the powers of \\(c\\). \n\nWait, no, actually, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product. So, that means we're considering all terms in the expansion where the variables \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are squared, regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in other words, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the sum of all the coefficients from the second expression multiplied by the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expression. \n\nWait, but that would mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that can't be right because the sum of the coefficients in the second expression is when \\(c = 1\\), so \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). So, then the coefficient would be 6 * 64 = 384. But that seems too high. Alternatively, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me check the problem again. \n\nWait, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, in other words, we're looking for the term where \\(a\\) is squared, \\(b\\) is squared, and \\(c\\) is raised to any power. But the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would be the sum of all terms in the expansion where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any power of \\(c\\). So, in effect, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all coefficients from the second part, because each term in the second part is being multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). \n\nWait, but that would mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The sum of the coefficients in a polynomial is found by setting all variables to 1. So, in this case, setting \\(c = 1\\) gives \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of the coefficients is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nBut that seems a bit too straightforward. Let me think again. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\). In that case, we would need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product. So, in that case, we would need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part, which is the constant term of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nSo, let's calculate the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem, the expansion is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\). So, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, the constant term is 20. \n\nSo, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then the coefficient would be 6 * 20 = 120. But wait, the problem didn't specify the power of \\(c\\), it just asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, perhaps I misinterpreted the problem. Let me check the original problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" \n\nSo, the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). That is, it's considering all terms in the product where \\(a\\) is squared and \\(b\\) is squared, regardless of the power of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient would be the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the sum of all coefficients from the second part, which is 64, as I calculated earlier. So, 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nBut wait, that seems high. Let me think again. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where \\(a\\) is squared, \\(b\\) is squared, and \\(c\\) is to the zero power. In that case, as I calculated earlier, the coefficient would be 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nBut the problem didn't specify the power of \\(c\\), so I'm a bit confused. Let me check the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, it's just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). That is, in the entire expansion, collect all terms that have \\(a^2b^2\\) and sum their coefficients. So, each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) will be multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), and the coefficients will add up. So, the total coefficient would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expression. \n\nBut the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, the total coefficient would be 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is only considering terms where the exponents of \\(c\\) are non-negative, but I don't think that's the case unless specified. The problem didn't specify, so I think it's safe to assume that it's asking for the coefficient regardless of the power of \\(c\\). \n\nWait, but let me think again. If I have \\((a + b)^4\\), which gives me terms up to \\(a^4\\) and \\(b^4\\), and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which gives me terms from \\(c^6\\) down to \\(c^{-6}\\). So, when I multiply them together, each term in the first expression is multiplied by each term in the second expression. So, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part, which includes \\(c^6, c^4, c^2, 1, c^{-2}, c^{-4}, c^{-6}\\), etc. So, each of these will give a term like \\(6a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(6a^2b^2c^4\\), and so on. \n\nBut the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would include all these terms. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the sum of all the coefficients from the second expression multiplied by 6. So, if I sum all the coefficients in the second expression, which is 64, then 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nWait, but let me verify that. The sum of the coefficients in the second expression is indeed 64, as calculated by setting \\(c = 1\\). So, when I multiply \\(6a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expression, the total contribution to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 * (sum of coefficients in the second expression) = 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nAlternatively, if the problem had asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it would be 6 * 20 = 120, as I calculated earlier. But since it's just asking for \\(a^2b^2\\), I think it's 384. \n\nWait, but let me make sure. Let me think of a simpler example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^1 (c + 1/c)^1\\). The expansion would be \\((a + b)(c + 1/c)\\). The coefficient of \\(a^1b^0\\) in the first part is 1, and the sum of coefficients in the second part is 2. So, the coefficient of \\(a^1b^0\\) in the product would be 1 * 2 = 2. Similarly, the coefficient of \\(a^0b^1\\) would also be 1 * 2 = 2. \n\nBut if I look at the product, it's \\(ac + a/c + bc + b/c\\). So, the coefficients of \\(a\\) are 1 and 1, but considering all terms, the coefficient of \\(a\\) is 1*(c + 1/c), which when considering the entire product, the coefficient of \\(a\\) would be the sum of the coefficients from the second expression. So, in this case, the coefficient of \\(a\\) is indeed 2, and similarly for \\(b\\). \n\nSo, applying that logic to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nWait, but let me check another way. Let me consider that when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a term is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each polynomial. But in this case, since the second polynomial has terms with \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), and we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient would be the sum of all the coefficients from the second polynomial multiplied by the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first polynomial. \n\nSo, yes, that would be 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting a different approach, where we consider the entire expansion and collect terms. But that seems more complicated. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and not considering the second part, but that doesn't make sense because the entire expression is the product of both parts. \n\nWait, no, the problem is definitely asking for the coefficient in the entire product. So, to clarify, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the sum of the coefficients of all terms in the product where \\(a\\) is squared and \\(b\\) is squared, regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, each such term is of the form \\(6a^2b^2 \\cdot \\text{(term from the second expression)}\\), so the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expression. \n\nTherefore, the coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. Let me think of another example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^2 (c + 1/c)^2\\). The first part expands to \\(a^2 + 2ab + b^2\\). The second part expands to \\(c^2 + 2 + 1/c^2\\). The product would be \\(a^2c^2 + 2a^2 + a^2/c^2 + 2ab c^2 + 4ab + 2ab/c^2 + b^2c^2 + 2b^2 + b^2/c^2\\). \n\nNow, looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^0\\), which would be the terms with \\(a^2\\). From the expansion, the terms are \\(a^2c^2\\), \\(2a^2\\), and \\(a^2/c^2\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) is \\(c^2 + 2 + 1/c^2\\), which when considering all coefficients, the sum is indeed \\(1 + 2 + 1 = 4\\), which is the sum of the coefficients in the second expression (since when \\(c = 1\\), the second expression is \\((1 + 1)^2 = 4\\)), and the coefficient from the first expression is 1. So, 1 * 4 = 4, which matches. \n\nSimilarly, the coefficient of \\(ab\\) in the product would be the coefficient from the first expression, which is 2, multiplied by the sum of coefficients from the second expression, which is 4, giving 8. Looking at the expansion, the terms with \\(ab\\) are \\(2ab c^2\\), \\(4ab\\), and \\(2ab/c^2\\). So, the coefficients are 2, 4, and 2, which sum to 8. \n\nSo, this seems to confirm that the approach is correct. Therefore, in the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nWait, but let me think again. The problem is \\((a + b)^4 (c + 1/c)^6\\). So, the first part has a term \\(6a^2b^2\\), and the second part has a sum of coefficients equal to 64. Therefore, when multiplied, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is simply the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of the coefficients in the second part. So, that would be 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nWait, but let me check the problem again. It says: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 (c + 1/c)^6\\)?\" So, it's just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). Therefore, the answer should be 384. \n\nBut to make sure, let me think of another way. Let me consider that the entire expression is a product of two independent polynomials. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial and the sum of the coefficients in the second polynomial. \n\nYes, that makes sense. Because when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a term like \\(a^2b^2\\) is the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial and the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial. \n\nSo, in this case, the coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nWait, but let me confirm this with another example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^1 (c + 1/c)^1\\). The first part has coefficients 1 for \\(a\\) and 1 for \\(b\\). The second part has coefficients 1 for \\(c\\) and 1 for \\(1/c\\), so the sum is 2. So, the coefficient of \\(a\\) in the product would be 1 * 2 = 2, and similarly for \\(b\\). \n\nLooking at the expansion: \\(ac + a/c + bc + b/c\\). The coefficients of \\(a\\) are 1 and 1, so the total coefficient is 2, which matches. Similarly for \\(b\\). \n\nSo, yes, this approach seems correct. Therefore, in the original problem, the coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nWait, but let me check one more time. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term in the product. Each occurrence of \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term from the second polynomial. So, the coefficient is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 64. Therefore, 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nI think that's the correct answer. So, I'll go with 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplying it by the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The sum of the coefficients in the second expression is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), resulting in \\(2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n\\boxed{384}"

So, the coefficient here is 6. But wait, the original expression is \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I need to consider the entire expression, not just \\((a + b)^4\\).\n\nHmm, so the coefficient I found, 6, is just for the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first part. But when I multiply this by the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the entire expression becomes a product of two polynomials. So, to get the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, I need to consider how the multiplication affects the terms.\n\nWait, but actually, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is only present in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\). When we multiply this by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the first polynomial will be multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. However, since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), we can think of it as multiplying \\(6a^2b^2\\) by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, no, that's not exactly right because the other terms in the first expansion (like \\(a^4\\), \\(a^3b\\), etc.) will also be multiplied by the second expansion, but since we're only interested in \\(a^2b^2\\), those other terms won't contribute to the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the final product.\n\nWait, actually, no. Let me clarify. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion is multiplied by every term in the second expansion. But the other terms in the first expansion (like \\(a^4\\), \\(a^3b\\), etc.) when multiplied by the second expansion will produce terms that have different powers of a and b. So, the only way to get a term with \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is if we take \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion and multiply it by any term from the second expansion. However, since the second expansion is in terms of c and 1/c, which are separate variables, multiplying by any term from the second expansion won't affect the powers of a and b. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product will just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion multiplied by the entire second expansion. But wait, no, that's not correct because when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second, and the coefficients add up if the variables match. But in this case, since the second polynomial doesn't have a and b, the variables in the product will be a combination of a, b, c, and 1/c. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product can only come from multiplying \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion by any term from the second expansion, but since the second expansion doesn't have a or b, the variables in the product will be \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2c^{-k}\\) for some k. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is actually the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. Wait, no, that's not quite right either because the second expansion has terms with different powers of c, but the variables are separate. So, actually, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will have coefficients that are the product of the coefficients from the first expansion and each term in the second expansion. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of c, we need to consider all the terms in the second expansion and multiply them by the coefficient 6 from the first expansion. But that doesn't make sense because the second expansion is a separate polynomial. Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this.\n\nLet me think differently. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When we expand this, each term in the expansion will be of the form \\((a^kb^{4 - k}) \\times (c^mc^{6 - m})\\) where k ranges from 0 to 4 and m ranges from 0 to 6. But wait, actually, the exponents for c are a bit different because it's \\(c + 1/c\\). So, the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) will have terms like \\(c^6\\), \\(c^4\\), \\(c^2\\), \\(c^0\\), \\(c^{-2}\\), \\(c^{-4}\\), \\(c^{-6}\\), each multiplied by their respective binomial coefficients.\n\nBut the point is, when we multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the variables a and b are independent of c and 1/c. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will have coefficients that are the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion and the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. Wait, no, that's not correct because each term in the second expansion is multiplied by each term in the first expansion, but since the variables are different, the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) is to take \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion and multiply it by any term from the second expansion. However, since we're just looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of c, the coefficient will be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. But that can't be right because the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion is when c = 1, which would be \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 * 64 = 384. But wait, that seems too high, and I think I'm making a mistake here.\n\nWait, no. Actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion multiplied by the entire second expansion. But since the second expansion is a separate polynomial, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion multiplied by the entire second expansion. But that doesn't make sense because the second expansion has multiple terms. Wait, perhaps I'm confusing how the coefficients add up. Let me think again.\n\nWhen you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum of the products of the coefficients of terms whose variables multiply to give that specific term. In this case, the specific term is \\(a^2b^2\\). Since the second polynomial doesn't have a or b, the variables in the product term \\(a^2b^2\\) can only come from the first polynomial. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is simply the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial multiplied by the entire second polynomial. But that can't be right because the second polynomial is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which has multiple terms. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial. Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second polynomial, you get terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), etc., but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of c, we need to consider all the terms in the second polynomial and sum their coefficients. But that's not quite right because the variables are separate. Wait, actually, no. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will have a coefficient that is the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial and the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial. Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second polynomial, you're effectively scaling \\(a^2b^2\\) by each coefficient in the second polynomial, and since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the c terms, we sum all those scaled coefficients. So, the total coefficient would be 6 (from the first expansion) multiplied by the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion.\n\nBut wait, the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\). So, \\(\\left(1 + 1/1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 * 64 = 384. But I'm not sure if that's correct because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for any k. So, actually, in the product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will have a coefficient that is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion because each term in the second expansion is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient is indeed 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me double-check that logic. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product comes from multiplying \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion by each term in the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. Because each term in the second expansion is of the form coefficient * c^k, so when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each of these, you get \\(a^2b^2\\) times coefficient * c^k. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of c, we sum all the coefficients from the second expansion and multiply by 6. So yes, that makes sense.\n\nBut wait, another way to think about it is that the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). If we consider that the variables a, b, c are independent, then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the c terms, the coefficient will be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, if we were to collect like terms, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by every term in the second expansion, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), \\(a^2b^2c^2\\), \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), \\(a^2b^2c^{-2}\\), \\(a^2b^2c^{-4}\\), and \\(a^2b^2c^{-6}\\). Each of these has a coefficient that is 6 times the respective binomial coefficient from the second expansion. But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of c, we need to sum all these coefficients. So, that would be 6 times the sum of all binomial coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but hold on a second. Is the problem asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, or is it asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some specific k? The problem says, \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\". Since it doesn't specify any power of c, it's just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the c terms. Therefore, in the product, \\(a^2b^2\\) will appear multiplied by various powers of c, but the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the sum of all coefficients of terms \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for all k. Therefore, that sum is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nBut wait, let me make sure I'm not confusing the term \"coefficient\". The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the sum of all the coefficients of terms where the variables a and b are squared, regardless of the power of c. So, each term in the product is of the form \\(a^kb^{4 - k}c^m\\), where k ranges from 0 to 4 and m ranges from -6 to 6. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be present in the product as \\(a^2b^2c^m\\) for various m, each multiplied by their respective coefficients. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the sum of all coefficients of \\(a^2b^2c^m\\) for all m. Since the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^m\\) is the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion (which is 6) and the coefficient of \\(c^m\\) in the second expansion.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. As I calculated earlier, the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion is when c = 1, which is \\( (1 + 1)^6 = 64 \\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Is this correct? Because the second expansion is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which when expanded has terms with both positive and negative exponents of c. So, the sum of all coefficients is indeed when c = 1, which gives 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, if I were to compute the entire product, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 multiplied by each term in the second expansion, but since we're summing over all possible c terms, it's 6 * 64.\n\nWait, but let me think about another approach. Maybe I can consider the entire product and find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) by looking at how the terms combine. The first part is \\((a + b)^4\\), which gives \\(a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). The second part is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which can be expanded as \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, each term in the second expansion is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\) for k from 0 to 6.\n\nTherefore, when we multiply the two expansions, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, resulting in terms like \\(6a^2b^2 \\times \\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^{6 - 2k}\\) is \\(6 \\times \\dbinom{6}{k}\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of c, we need to sum all these coefficients for k from 0 to 6. Therefore, the total coefficient is \\(6 \\times \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k}\\).\n\nBut \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the total coefficient is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 384.\n\nWait, but let me just confirm this with an example. Suppose I have a simpler case: \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, expanding \\((a + b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2\\). The second expansion is \\(c + 1/c\\). So, multiplying these together, we get:\n\n\\(a^2c + a^2/c + 2ab c + 2ab/c + b^2c + b^2/c\\).\n\nNow, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in this product is 0 because there are no \\(a^2b^2\\) terms. Wait, that's different. Hmm, so in this case, the coefficient is 0. But according to my previous logic, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion (which is 0) multiplied by the sum of coefficients in the second expansion (which is 2). So, 0 * 2 = 0, which matches. So, that seems correct.\n\nAnother example: \\((a + b)^3 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). The first expansion is \\(a^3 + 3a^2b + 3ab^2 + b^3\\). The second expansion is \\(c + 1/c\\). Multiplying them, we get terms like \\(a^3c + a^3/c + 3a^2bc + 3a^2b/c + 3ab^2c + 3ab^2/c + b^3c + b^3/c\\). The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in this product is 0 because there are no \\(a^2b^2\\) terms. According to my logic, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion is 3 (from \\(3ab^2\\), but wait, no, \\(3ab^2\\) is \\(a^1b^2\\), not \\(a^2b^2\\). The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion is actually 0 because in \\((a + b)^3\\), the highest power of a is 3, and the term with \\(a^2b^1\\) is \\(3a^2b\\), so there is no \\(a^2b^2\\) term. Therefore, the coefficient is 0, which matches the product.\n\nWait, but in the previous example, when I had \\((a + b)^4 \\times (c + 1/c)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion is 6, and the sum of coefficients in the second expansion is 64, so the total coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384. So, that seems consistent.\n\nWait, but in the first example, \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 0, which matches 0 * 2 = 0. In the second example, \\((a + b)^3 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is also 0, which again matches 0 * 2 = 0. So, my logic seems to hold.\n\nTherefore, applying this to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product equal to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion? Because in the first example, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion was 0, so the total coefficient was 0, which is correct. In the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion is 6, and the sum of coefficients in the second expansion is 64, so the total coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, another way to think about it is that when you have two independent polynomials multiplied together, the coefficient of a term in one polynomial is unaffected by the variables in the other polynomial. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is simply the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial multiplied by the entire second polynomial. But since we're only interested in the coefficient, regardless of the variables in the second polynomial, it's the product of the coefficients.\n\nWait, but that's not quite accurate because the second polynomial has multiple terms, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial. Because each term in the second polynomial adds a multiple of the coefficient from the first polynomial.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nTherefore, after all this thinking and checking, I believe the coefficient is 384.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem.\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\dbinom{4}{0}a^4 + \\dbinom{4}{1}a^3b + \\dbinom{4}{2}a^2b^2 + \\dbinom{4}{3}ab^3 + \\dbinom{4}{4}b^4\n   \\]\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n\n2. **Consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   The sum of all coefficients in this expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives:\n   \\[\n   (1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\n   \\]\n\n3. **Multiply the coefficient from the first expansion by the sum of coefficients from the second expansion:**\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 64 = 384\n   \\]\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{384}\\)."

Now, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). That means I need to find the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2. So, \\(a^2b^2\\) would correspond to \\(k = 2\\) in the binomial expansion, right? Because \\(4 - k = 2\\) implies \\(k = 2\\).\n\nCalculating the binomial coefficient for \\(k = 2\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Let me compute that: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. Got that part down.\n\nNow, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I also need to consider the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I wonder if I need to expand this part as well. Wait, but the problem is asking specifically for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Hmm, that term only involves \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), so maybe the \\(c\\) terms don't affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)? Let me think about that.\n\nWhen I multiply two expressions together, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression. So, if I have \\( (a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 \\), each term from the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term from the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), maybe the coefficient is just the same as in \\((a + b)^4\\), multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. Wait, no, that might not be correct.\n\nWait, actually, no. Because when you multiply by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), you're adding more terms, but since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't have any \\(c\\) terms, the coefficient would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because only the constant term (i.e., the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero) would not affect the \\(a^2b^2\\) term when multiplying.\n\nSo, I think I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me figure that out. Using the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying each term, that becomes \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m - m} = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\).\n\nWe need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is when \\(m = 3\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} c^{0} = \\dbinom{6}{3} \\times 1\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20.\n\nTherefore, going back to the original expression, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the constant term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). As we found earlier, that's 6 times 20, which is 120.\n\nWait a second, let me double-check that logic. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the first part, and when we multiply by the constant term from the second part, we're effectively just scaling it by 20. So, 6 times 20 is indeed 120. That seems right.\n\nAlternatively, another way to think about it is that when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each polynomial. Since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), we only consider the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second polynomial, which is 20. So, 6 times 20 is 120. Yep, that makes sense.\n\nI don't think I made any mistakes in the calculations. Let me just recap:\n\n1. Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is 6.\n2. Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem to find the constant term, which is 20.\n3. Multiply these two coefficients together to get the final coefficient in the product, which is 120.\n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem.\n\nFirst, we expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n\\]\nWe need the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2. This corresponds to \\(k = 2\\):\n\\[\n\\dbinom{4}{2} a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\n\\]\nSo, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\nNext, we consider the expression \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).

Hmm, so I need to consider how this multiplication affects the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\).

But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, and since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. Wait, no, that's not correct either because the second part is another polynomial. Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating this.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider that when you multiply two expressions, the coefficients add when the variables match. But in this case, since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), any term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) would be multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), but since \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) are separate variables, the product would have terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) and \\(a^2b^2c^{-k}\\), etc. But the question is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would mean that we're considering the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, right? Because otherwise, the term would have \\(c\\) in it, and we're only interested in the \\(a^2b^2\\) term, regardless of \\(c\\)'s exponent. Wait, no, that's not quite right. Let me clarify.\n\nWait, the problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\" in the entire product. So, in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term would be of the form \\(a^k b^{4 - k} \\times c^m\\) or something like that, depending on the exponents from both expansions. But the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would come from the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\), specifically when \\(k = 2\\), as we found earlier, and then multiplied by any term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). However, since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, I think that's considering all possible terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) appears, regardless of the exponent of \\(c\\). But that doesn't make sense because each term in the product will have both \\(a\\) and \\(c\\) parts. Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, so the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\). But that seems more complicated, and I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). But that would mean that the coefficient is the same as in \\((a + b)^4\\), multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which would make the coefficient a polynomial in \\(c\\), which seems unlikely. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when the entire expression is expanded, and considering all possible terms, but since \\(c\\) is another variable, the coefficient would actually be a sum over all possible terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present, each multiplied by their respective \\(c\\) terms. But that seems too broad.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me re-examine the problem: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, in the entire expansion, each term is a product of a term from \\((a + b)^4\\) and a term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the term in \\((a + b)^4\\) that is \\(a^2b^2\\), which we found has a coefficient of 6, and then it's multiplied by every term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, is that correct? Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, each of those would contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, but only if the term from the second expansion is a constant (i.e., \\(c^0\\)), because otherwise, the term would have \\(c\\) raised to some power, and the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\). So, perhaps I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), and then multiply that by 6.\n\nWait, that makes more sense. Because if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, that would be the term where the \\(c\\) exponents cancel out, i.e., \\(c^0\\). So, the coefficient would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, first, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), and then multiply that by 6.\n\nAlright, so let's compute that. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) can be done using the binomial theorem as well. The general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We want the exponent of \\(c\\) to be zero, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\).\n\nCalculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 times 20, which is 120.\n\nWait, let me double-check that. So, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. In \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. So, when we multiply the two, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by the constant term (20) from the second part, resulting in 6 * 20 = 120. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 120.\n\nWait, but hold on a second. Let me make sure I didn't make a mistake. So, in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the expansion is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\times c^{-k}\\) which simplifies to \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, when does the exponent equal zero? When \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), so \\(k = 3\\). So, yes, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, that's correct.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is indeed 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but just to be thorough, let me think about it another way. Suppose I consider the entire product: \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\), and when multiplied by any term from the second expansion, it would create terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2c^{-k}\\). But if we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then the coefficient would be the sum of all the coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by 6. But that doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a specific term, not considering \\(c\\). So, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), which is the term where \\(c\\) cancels out. So, in that case, the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120, as I found earlier.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem was asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some specific \\(k\\), that would be different, but since it's just \\(a^2b^2\\), I think it's safe to assume that \\(c\\) must be raised to the zero power, making the term \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient is 120.\n\nI think that's it. I can't see any mistakes in my reasoning, so I'm confident that the coefficient is 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem for both parts of the expression.\n\nFirst, we expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n\\]\nThe term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\), so the coefficient is:\n\\[\n\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\n\\]\n\nNext, we consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem:\n\\[\n\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n\\]\nWe need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, which occurs when \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(k = 3\\). The coefficient of this term is:\n\\[\n\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\n\\]\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the product of the coefficients from both expansions:\n\\[\n6 \\times 20 = 120\n\\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

Okay, so the term with \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(6a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6.\n\nNow, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I need to consider both parts. Wait, but the question is only asking about the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). That term is present only in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\), right? Because the other part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), so when I multiply them together, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will be multiplied by each term from the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since the question is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\), I think that means I just need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and then multiply it by the entire expansion of the second part. Wait, no, actually, when you multiply two expressions, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. But since the second part doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will just be multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression will be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, that doesn't seem right because the sum of all coefficients would be when \\(c = 1\\), but I'm not sure if that's the case here.\n\nWait, no, actually, when you have a term like \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, and you multiply it by each term in the second expansion, each term in the second expansion is a coefficient times some power of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the powers of \\(c\\), that means that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is just 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in the second expansion. Because when you multiply \\(6a^2b^2\\) by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), you get terms like \\(6a^2b^2c^k\\) and \\(6a^2b^2c^{-k}\\), etc. So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms is 6 multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients in the second expansion.\n\nSo, to find the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), I can set \\(c = 1\\). Because when \\(c = 1\\), each term becomes just its coefficient. So, substituting \\(c = 1\\), we get \\(\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = (1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me double-check that. Alternatively, maybe I should consider that the second expansion, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), can also be expanded using the binomial theorem. Let me write that out:\n\n\\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\).\n\nSo, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, when I multiply this by \\(6a^2b^2\\), I get \\(6a^2b^2 \\times \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384, as I thought earlier.\n\nWait, but another way to think about it is that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\).

The sum of these coefficients is when \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\(2^6 = 64\\). So, the total coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but another thought: maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some specific \\(k\\)? But the problem just says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", without specifying any particular power of \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would indeed be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, because each term in the second expansion contributes to a different power of \\(c\\), but since the problem doesn't specify, it's considering all possible powers of \\(c\\). Therefore, the total coefficient is 384.\n\nSo, I think I'm confident that the coefficient is 384.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{384}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem.\n\nFirst, we expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n\\]\nThe term with \\(a^2b^2\\) is:\n\\[\n\\dbinom{4}{2} a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\n\\]\nSo, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\nNext, we consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).

Simplifying the coefficients, that would be \\(1 \\cdot a^4 + 4 \\cdot a^3b + 6 \\cdot a^2b^2 + 4 \\cdot ab^3 + 1 \\cdot b^4\\). \n\nOkay, so I see that the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is present in this expansion, and its coefficient is 6. Now, the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I need to consider how this multiplication affects the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). \n\nWait, but I'm only asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not considering any terms with \\(c\\). That makes me think that the \\(c\\) terms might not affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but I'm not entirely sure. Let me think. \n\nActually, when you multiply two expressions, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part, which is \\(6a^2b^2\\), will be multiplied by every term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I need to see if any of these multiplications introduce new \\(a\\) or \\(b\\) terms. \n\nWait, no, because the second part is in terms of \\(c\\), so when I multiply \\(6a^2b^2\\) by terms involving \\(c\\), the result will be terms like \\(6a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(6a^2b^2 \\cdot \\dfrac{1}{c^k}\\), but not any terms with more \\(a\\) or \\(b\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product will just be \\(6\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients from the second expression, because each term in the second expression is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), and we want the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. \n\nWait, no, that doesn't sound right. Let me correct that. Actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product will be \\(6\\) multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because each term in the second expansion will multiply \\(6a^2b^2\\), contributing to terms like \\(6a^2b^2c^k\\) and \\(6a^2b^2 \\cdot \\dfrac{1}{c^k}\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, we can consider that each multiplication by a term in the second expansion adds a multiple of \\(a^2b^2\\) with a coefficient equal to the coefficient of that term in the second expansion. \n\nWait, no, that's not correct either. Because when you multiply \\(6a^2b^2\\) by, say, \\(c^3\\), you get \\(6a^2b^2c^3\\), which is a different term. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product remains just \\(6\\), because none of the multiplications by terms in the second expression will change the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) itself. The other terms will have higher powers of \\(c\\) or negative powers, but not affect the \\(a^2b^2\\) term's coefficient. \n\nWait, no, that's not right. Because when you multiply \\(6a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, each of those terms is just a scalar multiple. So, for example, if the second expansion has a term \\(k \\cdot c^m\\), then multiplying by \\(6a^2b^2\\) gives \\(6k a^2b^2 c^m\\). But since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), each of these terms contributes \\(6k\\) to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the total coefficient would be \\(6\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. \n\nWait, that makes sense. Because each term in the second expansion, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), contributes a term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by that coefficient, and since we're summing over all possible \\(c\\) terms, the total coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) would be \\(6\\) times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion. \n\nSo, let me compute the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). To find the sum of the coefficients, I can substitute \\(c = 1\\). Because when \\(c = 1\\), each term becomes just its coefficient. So, substituting \\(c = 1\\), we get \\((1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion is 64. \n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). \n\nWait, but let me double-check that reasoning. Because if I have two expressions, say \\(P(a, b)\\) and \\(Q(c)\\), then the coefficient of a specific term in \\(P(a, b)\\) when multiplied by \\(Q(c)\\) is just the coefficient in \\(P(a, b)\\) times the sum of coefficients in \\(Q(c)\\), because each term in \\(Q(c)\\) is a scalar that multiplies the entire \\(P(a, b)\\). So, in this case, since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term in \\(P(a, b)\\), its coefficient in the product will be \\(6\\) times the sum of coefficients in \\(Q(c)\\), which is 64. So, yes, 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nAlternatively, another way to think about it is that when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in one polynomial is scaled by the sum of all coefficients in the other polynomial. So, since we're only interested in \\(a^2b^2\\), and the second polynomial doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), each term in the second polynomial just scales the entire first polynomial by its coefficient. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient in the first polynomial times the sum of coefficients in the second polynomial. \n\nSo, I think that makes sense. Therefore, the coefficient is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by substituting \\(c = 1\\), giving \\(2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n\\boxed{384}"

But that doesn't sound right because when you multiply, each term is multiplied individually, but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), maybe the coefficient remains 6, and the rest of the terms involve \\(c\\) which we don't care about. Wait, no, that can't be right because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but since the entire expression is a product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by each term from the second expansion.

So, then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 * 64 = 384. But that seems too straightforward. Let me check if that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Since \\(a^2b^2\\) is only from the first part, and when you multiply by the second part, which doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would just be the coefficient from the first part times the entire expansion of the second part, but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is independent of \\(c\\), maybe the coefficient remains 6, and the rest of the terms are multiplied by various powers of \\(c\\), but since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), it would be 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, so 6*64=384. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some specific \\(k\\), but the problem doesn't specify, so maybe it's just 6*64=384. Wait, but I'm not sure if that's the case. Let me think again.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. The problem says, \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", without specifying any power of \\(c\\). So, in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be present in the first part, and when multiplied by the second part, it would be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, each of which is of the form \\(c^k\\) or \\(c^{-k}\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would appear in the product as \\(a^2b^2 \\times\\) each term from the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Because each term in the second part is a coefficient times some power of \\(c\\), so when you multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), you're effectively scaling the coefficient by the sum of all coefficients in the second part. So, the sum of coefficients in the second part is obtained by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nBut let me check this another way. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), which would mean that it's the same as the coefficient in the first part multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part, so the coefficient would indeed be 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, maybe I should consider that the second part could contribute different powers of \\(c\\), but since the problem doesn't specify any power of \\(c\\), maybe it's just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) irrespective of \\(c\\), which would mean that it's 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, giving 384.\n\nWait, but another thought: perhaps I'm supposed to consider that the second expansion might have terms that affect the coefficient. But actually, since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term in the first part, and the second part is a separate expansion, when you multiply, each term in the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, which are terms like \\(c^6\\), \\(6c^4\\), \\(15c^2\\), \\(20\\), \\(15c^{-2}\\), \\(6c^{-4}\\), and \\(c^{-6}\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^6\\) would be 6*1=6, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^4\\) would be 6*6=36, and so on. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), without specifying any power of \\(c\\). So, does that mean we're supposed to sum all the coefficients where the power of \\(c\\) is zero? Because otherwise, if we consider all possible powers of \\(c\\), then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually be the sum of all the coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by 6. But that's not the case because each term in the product would have a specific power of \\(c\\). So, perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), which would mean that it's 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, giving 384. Alternatively, perhaps the problem wants the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where the power of \\(c\\) is zero. Let me check that.\n\nIf the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then we need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion. The coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is the middle term, which is when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. Using the binomial theorem, the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, the exponent of \\(c\\) is \\(6 - 2k\\). We want this exponent to be zero, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part, which is 20. So, 6 * 20 = 120. But wait, the problem didn't specify any power of \\(c\\), just \\(a^2b^2\\). So, if it's asking for the coefficient regardless of \\(c\\), it would be 6 * 64 = 384, but if it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), it would be 120. So, which one is it?\n\nLooking back at the problem: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" It doesn't specify any power of \\(c\\), so I think it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. But wait, that seems high. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times the constant term, i.e., \\(c^0\\), so 6 * 20 = 120. Hmm.\n\nWait, perhaps I should think of the entire expression as a product, and when you multiply two polynomials, each term from the first is multiplied by each term from the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, which includes \\(c^6\\), \\(6c^4\\), \\(15c^2\\), \\(20\\), \\(15c^{-2}\\), \\(6c^{-4}\\), and \\(c^{-6}\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the sum of all these products, i.e., 6*(1 + 6 + 15 + 20 + 15 + 6 + 1) = 6*64 = 384. So, that's the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), etc., but the problem is only asking for \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in that case, yes, it's 384.\n\nBut wait, another perspective: perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, meaning that the term \\(a^2b^2\\) can be multiplied by any power of \\(c\\), so the coefficient would indeed be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, so 6*64=384. Therefore, the answer is 384.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because sometimes when people ask for the coefficient of a term in a product, they might be referring to the term with specific exponents for all variables, but in this case, since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), maybe they just want the coefficient irrespective of \\(c\\). So, I think the correct approach is to consider that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, and since it's multiplied by each term in the second expansion, the total coefficient would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, so 6*64=384.\n\nAlternatively, let me think of it as two separate expansions. The first expansion gives me terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the second expansion gives me terms involving \\(c\\). When I multiply them, each term from the first is multiplied by each term from the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, which are \\(c^6\\), \\(6c^4\\), \\(15c^2\\), \\(20\\), \\(15c^{-2}\\), \\(6c^{-4}\\), \\(c^{-6}\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the sum of 6 times each of these coefficients, because each term from the second expansion is multiplied by 6. So, 6*(1 + 6 + 15 + 20 + 15 + 6 + 1) = 6*64=384. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 384.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me compute the sum inside the second expansion. The coefficients are 1, 6, 15, 20, 15, 6, 1. Adding them up: 1 + 6 =7, 7 +15=22, 22+20=42, 42+15=57, 57+6=63, 63+1=64. So, yes, the sum is 64. So, 6*64=384.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 384.\n\nBut wait, another way to think about it: perhaps the problem is only considering the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where \\(c\\) is raised to the zero power. In that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion, which is 20, so 6*20=120. But the problem didn't specify \\(c^0\\), so I think it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), so 384.\n\nWait, but let me check the problem statement again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" It doesn't mention anything about \\(c\\), so I think it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) irrespective of the power of \\(c\\), which would be 384.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting just the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, but that seems unlikely because the entire expression is a product, so the coefficient would be scaled by the second part.\n\nWait, but let me think again. If I have two polynomials, P(a, b) and Q(c), then the product P(a, b) * Q(c) would have terms where each term from P is multiplied by each term from Q. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the same as the coefficient in P(a, b) times the sum of all coefficients in Q(c). Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in Q(c), you're effectively scaling the coefficient by each term's coefficient, and summing them up. So, yes, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the sum of coefficients in Q(c), which is 64, giving 384.\n\nTherefore, I think the correct answer is 384.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\n   \\]\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) here is 6.\n\n2. **Consider the second part \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   The sum of all coefficients in this expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\):\n   \\[\n   \\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\n   \\]\n\n3. **Multiply the coefficient from the first part by the sum of coefficients from the second part:**\n   Since each term in the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is:\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 64 = 384\n   \\]\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{384}\\)."

So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) here is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Let me compute that: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\\). So, the term with \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(6a^2b^2\\). \n\nBut wait, the original expression is \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is going to be multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 multiplied by the sum of all the terms in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But hold on, that can't be right because I'm only asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not considering the other variables. Hmm, maybe I need to think differently.\n\nWait, no, actually, since the variables \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), the terms in \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) are independent. So, when I multiply the two expansions together, each term from the first expansion gets multiplied by each term from the second expansion. But since I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), I can consider that term in isolation. That is, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by every term in the second part, but since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would just be \\(6\\) times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. Wait, no, that doesn't make sense because each term in the product would be something like \\(6a^2b^2 \\times \\text{something with } c\\). But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, maybe I'm overcomplicating it.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, treating \\(c\\) as another variable. But that might not be the case because \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) are present, so maybe the term \\(a^2b^2\\) could be multiplied by various powers of \\(c\\), but the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. Hmm, that is, perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) irrespective of the \\(c\\) terms. So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Because when you multiply \\(6a^2b^2\\) by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each of those terms would have a coefficient, and the total coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) times any power of \\(c\\) would be the sum of all those coefficients.\n\nBut wait, that might not be correct. Let me think again. The problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", but in the entire expression, \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by various powers of \\(c\\). So, unless we're considering \\(a^2b^2\\) as a standalone term without any \\(c\\) terms, but that's not possible because when you multiply the two expressions, every term will have both \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) parts and \\(c\\) parts. So, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^k\\) for some \\(k\\), but the problem doesn't specify. Wait, the problem just says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", so maybe it's considering \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), because each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) contributes a coefficient when multiplied by \\(6a^2b^2\\), and the total coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) across all possible \\(c\\) terms would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion.\n\nWait, but let me check that. The sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) would be obtained by setting \\(c = 1\\), right? So, if I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(1 + 1/1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 * 64 = 384. But wait, that seems too high. Alternatively, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, without considering the \\(c\\) terms. So, in other words, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) could be multiplied by any power of \\(c\\), but the coefficient is just the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion, because each term in the second expansion contributes to the coefficient when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). So, if I take the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and then multiply it by the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which is 64, then the total coefficient would be 6 * 64 = 384. But I'm not entirely sure if that's the correct approach.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times a specific power of \\(c\\), but since it's not specified, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Let me try another approach.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, considering all possible terms. So, when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in the expansion will be of the form \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}a^{4 - k}b^k \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - m}(1/c)^m\\). So, simplifying, that's \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}\\dbinom{6}{m}a^{4 - k}b^k c^{6 - 2m}\\). Now, we need the terms where \\(a^2b^2\\), which means \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). So, k = 2. Therefore, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) times the sum over all m of \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\) times the coefficient from the second expansion. Wait, no, because for each m, we get a term with \\(c^{6 - 2m}\\), but the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is \\(\\dbinom{6}{0} + \\dbinom{6}{1} + \\dots + \\dbinom{6}{6} = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the total coefficient would be 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me check again. Alternatively, maybe I'm supposed to consider the entire term, including the \\(c\\) part, but the problem doesn't specify, so perhaps it's just 6 times 64. Hmm, but 384 seems quite large. Let me see if that makes sense. Alternatively, perhaps I'm supposed to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times a specific power of \\(c\\), but the problem doesn't specify, so maybe it's just 6 times the sum of coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it and the answer is just 6, but that seems unlikely because the second part is also being multiplied. So, perhaps I should think of it as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and then the entire expression is multiplied by the second part, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second part, which is 64, giving 384.\n\nWait, but another way to think about it is that when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each polynomial. But in this case, since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part will be multiplied by every term in the second part, each of which has a coefficient. Therefore, the total coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) across all possible \\(c\\) terms would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part. So, that would be 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, without considering the \\(c\\) terms, so it's just 6 times the entire expansion of the second part, but that would mean the coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because the problem is written as \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), so perhaps the variables are separate, and the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is independent of \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which would be 6 times 64, which is 384. So, the coefficient is 384.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, meaning that the term \\(a^2b^2\\) can be multiplied by any power of \\(c\\), and the coefficient is just the sum of all the coefficients from the second expansion. So, in that case, it's 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it, and the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and the second part doesn't affect it because \\(c\\) is a separate variable. But that doesn't seem right because when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second part, which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me check with an example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^1 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, expanding, we have \\((a + b)(c + 1/c) = a c + a/c + b c + b/c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a\\) in this product would be \\(c + 1/c\\), but if we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a\\) regardless of \\(c\\), it's just the sum of coefficients, which is \\(1 + 1 = 2\\). So, in this case, the coefficient of \\(a\\) would be 2 times the coefficient from the first part, which is 1, so 2 * 1 = 2. Similarly, in the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but in the example I just did, the coefficient of \\(a\\) is \\(c + 1/c\\), which has coefficients 1 and 1. So, the sum of the coefficients is 2, which is correct. So, applying that logic, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the original problem would be 6 times 64, which is 384.\n\nWait, but another way to think about it is that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the product of the coefficients of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial and the constant term in the second polynomial. But that doesn't make sense because the second polynomial isn't a constant. So, that approach is incorrect.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, without considering the \\(c\\) terms, meaning that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me think differently. Maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), because \\(c^0\\) is 1, so it's just the constant term. So, in that case, I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product. So, that would involve finding terms where in the first polynomial, we have \\(a^2b^2\\), and in the second polynomial, we have \\(c^0\\). So, the coefficient would be the product of the coefficients from each part.\n\nIn the first part, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, as we found earlier. In the second part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is the middle term when expanded. Let me compute that.\n\nThe expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - m}(1/c)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the exponent of \\(c\\) is \\(6 - 2m\\). We need the term where the exponent is 0, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which gives \\(m = 3\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product would be \\(6 * 20 = 120\\). So, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. But the problem just says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", so I'm not sure if it's considering only \\(a^2b^2\\) times any power of \\(c\\), or specifically \\(a^2b^2c^0\\).\n\nWait, the problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", without mentioning \\(c\\), so maybe it's considering all terms where the variables are \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, giving 384.\n\nBut in the example I did earlier with \\((a + b)(c + 1/c)\\), the coefficient of \\(a\\) was \\(c + 1/c\\), which has a sum of coefficients equal to 2, so the coefficient of \\(a\\) regardless of \\(c\\) is 2, which matches 1 (from the first part) times 2 (sum of coefficients in the second part). So, applying that logic, in the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nBut then, in the example, if I wanted the coefficient of \\(a c^0\\), it would be 1 * 20 = 20, but the problem didn't specify, so I think the correct interpretation is that it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which would be 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because in the example, if I just take the coefficient of \\(a\\) without considering \\(c\\), it's 2, which is 1 * 2. So, in the original problem, it's 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and since \\(c\\) is a separate variable, the coefficient is just 6, but that seems incorrect because the second part is also being multiplied.\n\nWait, but let me think again. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, when you multiply these two polynomials together, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second part, which includes \\(c^6\\), \\(6c^4\\), \\(15c^2\\), \\(20\\), \\(15/c^2\\), \\(6/c^4\\), \\(1/c^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be \\(6 \\times (1 + 6 + 15 + 20 + 15 + 6 + 1)\\), which is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\nWait, but in this case, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so it's considering all possible terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present, regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient is 384.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem had specified a particular power of \\(c\\), say \\(c^0\\), then the coefficient would be 6 * 20 = 120. But since it's not specified, I think it's 384.\n\nWait, but let me check that again. The problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", so in the product, \\(a^2b^2\\) can be multiplied by any power of \\(c\\), so the coefficient would be the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by 6. So, 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is only considering the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\), which would be 6 * 20 = 120. But since the problem doesn't specify, I'm not sure. However, given that the problem is written as \\((a + b)^4 \\times (c + 1/c)^6\\), and it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I think it's more likely that it's considering all possible terms, so the coefficient is 384.\n\nWait, but I'm still a bit uncertain. Let me try to see if there's another way to approach this. Maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be 120, as I calculated earlier. Alternatively, perhaps it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), which would be 384.\n\nWait, let me think about how the problem is phrased. It says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", so in the context of the entire expression, which includes \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), it's possible that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times any power of \\(c\\). So, that would mean the coefficient is 384.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is only considering the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\), which is the constant term, so that would be 120. But without more context, it's hard to say. However, given that the problem is written as it is, I think the intended answer is 120, because when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would only be multiplied by the constant term in the second expansion to give a term with \\(a^2b^2\\) and no \\(c\\). So, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nWait, but in that case, the problem should have specified \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), but it didn't. So, perhaps it's 384.\n\nWait, I'm getting confused. Let me try to structure this better.\n\n1. Expand \\((a + b)^4\\): the term with \\(a^2b^2\\) has coefficient 6.\n2. Expand \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\): the sum of all coefficients is \\(2^6 = 64\\).\n3. When multiplying the two expansions, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 * 64 = 384, because each term in the second expansion contributes a coefficient when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\).\n\nAlternatively, if we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then we need to find the term in the second expansion where \\(c^0\\), which is when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), so \\(m = 3\\), and the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) would be 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nBut since the problem just says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", without specifying \\(c\\), I think it's more likely that it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), which would be 384.\n\nWait, but let me check the problem again: it says \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)\". So, it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, which includes all possible powers of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but in the example I did earlier, if I have \\((a + b)(c + 1/c)\\), the coefficient of \\(a\\) is \\(c + 1/c\\), which has a sum of coefficients equal to 2. So, the coefficient of \\(a\\) regardless of \\(c\\) is 2, which is 1 * 2. So, applying that logic, in the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nTherefore, after all this thinking, I believe the coefficient is 384.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we proceed as follows:\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem**:\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term with \\(a^2b^2\\) is when \\(k = 2\\), so its coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n\n2. **Consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)**:\n   The sum of all coefficients in this expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\(2^6 = 64\\).\n\n3. **Combine the results**:\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient from the first part (6) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients from the second part (64), resulting in \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n**Answer**: The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{384}\\)."

    "text": " Let me write that out using the binomial theorem.\n\nSo, expanding \\((a + b)^4\\), it becomes \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\\). Now, I'm looking for the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2, because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). That means I need to find the term where \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). Let me check: if \\(4 - k = 2\\), then \\(k = 2\\). Yep, that works. So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient is 6. That takes care of the first part.\n\nNow, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Since I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I need to consider how this term interacts with the second part of the expression, which is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but actually, since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) don't directly interact with the terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, when I multiply the two expressions together, each term from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term from the second expansion. However, since I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and the second part doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression will just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire second part's expansion. Wait, but that doesn't make sense because the second part is a separate variable. Let me think again.\n\nWait, no, actually, when you multiply two expressions, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, it's the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, because the second part doesn't have any \\(a\\) or \\(b\\) terms. So, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first part is \\(6a^2b^2\\), and when multiplied by the entire second part, which is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will be multiplied by every term in the second expansion. But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and the second part doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms, does that mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just 6 times the entire second expression? But that can't be right because the problem is asking for a coefficient, which is a number, not an expression involving \\(c\\). Hmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem.\n\nWait, perhaps I misread the problem. Let me check again. It says, \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, the entire expression is a product of two binomial expansions. Now, when you multiply these two expansions, the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from the terms involving \\(c\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by every term in the second part. But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term in the variables \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the second part involves \\(c\\), perhaps the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just 6 times the entire expansion of the second part, but that seems odd because the coefficient should be a number, not an expression involving \\(c\\).\n\nWait, no, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think differently. When you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum of the products of the coefficients of terms that multiply together to give that specific term. But in this case, since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are only in the first part and \\(c\\) is only in the second part, the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is to take the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part and multiply it by any term from the second part. But since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Wait, is that right?\n\nWait, no. Because each term in the product is a product of a term from the first expansion and a term from the second expansion. So, if I have a term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion, and I multiply it by any term from the second expansion, say \\(c^k \\times \\dfrac{1}{c}^m\\), which simplifies to \\(c^{k - m}\\), then the resulting term would be \\(a^2b^2c^{k - m}\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would be the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by the coefficient from the first part. Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, each such term contributes to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. Wait, but that can't be right because the second expansion has terms involving \\(c\\), so the product would have terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for various \\(k\\), but the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would be the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion, because each term in the second expansion, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), gives a term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present with a coefficient equal to the coefficient of that term in the second expansion.\n\nWait, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Because each term in the second part, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), adds to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. So, the coefficient is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nBut wait, the sum of the coefficients in a polynomial is found by plugging in 1 for all variables. So, the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) would be when \\(c = 1\\). So, let me compute that. Plugging \\(c = 1\\) into \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) gives \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 multiplied by 64, which is 384.\n\nWait, but that seems high. Let me check again. Alternatively, maybe I'm making a mistake here. Let me think differently. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion is 6a^2b^2. When I multiply this by the entire second expansion, which is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the second expansion is a term like \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - k}\\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, when I multiply 6a^2b^2 by each of these terms, I get terms like 6\\dbinom{6}{k}a^2b^2c^{6 - 2k}. So, in the entire product, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the sum over all k of \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}\\), because each term contributes \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}\\) to the coefficient when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). But the sum of \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}\\) for k from 0 to 6 is 2^6 = 64, as I thought before. So, 6 times 64 is indeed 384. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 384.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not missing anything. The problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term in the product. Since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are only in the first part, and \\(c\\) is only in the second part, the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is by taking the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part and multiplying it by any term from the second part. But each term from the second part, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), gives a term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present, but with different powers of \\(c\\). However, the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the sum of all the coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by the coefficient from the first part. So, that would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 times 64, which is 384.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should think of it as the product of two polynomials, and the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial times the entire second polynomial, but that doesn't make sense because the second polynomial is in different variables. Wait, no, when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial. Because each term in the second polynomial, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), contributes its coefficient to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. So, yes, that makes sense.\n\nSo, to recap: The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not confusing the variables. The problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in the product, every term that has \\(a^2b^2\\) will have a coefficient that's the product of the coefficients from the first and second parts. But since the second part doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) is by taking the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part and multiplying it by any term from the second part. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the sum of all coefficients in the second part. So, that's 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me check with an example. Let's say I have \\((a + b)^1 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, expanding, it would be (a + b)(c + 1/c) = ac + a/c + bc + b/c. The coefficient of \\(a^1b^0\\) would be c + 1/c, but if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^1b^0\\), it's just c + 1/c. But if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^1b^0\\) in terms of numerical coefficient, that doesn't make sense because it's not a number. So, perhaps in that case, the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, meaning that the coefficient is 6 times the entire second expansion, but that would make the coefficient a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't seem right. So, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\). That would make sense because then the coefficient would be a number. So, maybe the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). Let me check the original problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" Hmm, it just says \\(a^2b^2\\), so perhaps it's considering the coefficient as a polynomial in \\(c\\), but that seems odd. Alternatively, maybe the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) irrespective of \\(c\\), which would mean summing over all possible \\(c\\) exponents, which would give 384 as I thought earlier.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where the exponents of \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are 2, 2, and 0, respectively. That would make sense because then the coefficient would be a specific number. Let me try that approach.\n\nSo, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then I need to find the term in the product where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\). That means I need to take the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first expansion and multiply it by the \\(c^0\\) term from the second expansion. So, the coefficient would be 6 (from the first part) multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nSo, let's find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We want the exponent of \\(c\\) to be 0, so we set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire product is 6 * 20 = 120. But wait, the original problem didn't specify the \\(c^0\\) term; it just asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, maybe I'm overcomplicating things again.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). In that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the entire second expansion, which is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. So, perhaps the problem is actually to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be 120, as I calculated earlier.\n\nWait, but let me check again. If the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\), then it's 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. But if it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), it's 6 * 20 = 120. So, which one is it?\n\nLooking back at the problem: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" It just says \\(a^2b^2\\), without mentioning \\(c\\). So, perhaps it's considering the coefficient as a polynomial in \\(c\\), meaning that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the same as the coefficient from the first part times the entire second expansion. But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, not a number. So, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, considering all possible powers of \\(c\\). In that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the entire second expansion, which is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems unlikely because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be 120. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) irrespective of \\(c\\), which would be 384. But I'm not sure which one is intended.\n\nWait, perhaps I should look at the problem again. It says: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, the expression is a product of two polynomials, one in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the other in \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, when you multiply them, each term in the product will be of the form \\(a^kb^{4 - k} \\times c^m c^{-n}\\), but since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), the only way \\(a^2b^2\\) appears is when you take the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first expansion and multiply it by any term from the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. Because each term in the second expansion, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), contributes its coefficient to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product.\n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6, and the sum of the coefficients in the second part is 64, so the total coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me confirm this with a smaller example to see if this makes sense. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^1 \\times (c + 1/c)^1 = (a + b)(c + 1/c)\\). Expanding this gives \\(ac + a/c + bc + b/c\\). Now, the coefficient of \\(a^1b^0\\) is \\(c + 1/c\\), and the coefficient of \\(a^0b^1\\) is also \\(c + 1/c\\). If I were to ask for the coefficient of \\(a^1b^0\\), it would be \\(c + 1/c\\), which is a polynomial in \\(c\\). So, in this case, the coefficient is not a number but a polynomial. So, in the original problem, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), it would be a polynomial in \\(c\\), specifically \\(6 \\times (c + 1/c)^6\\). But that seems odd because the problem is asking for a coefficient, which is typically a number.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, considering all possible terms, which would mean that the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But that's not standard because usually, coefficients are numerical. So, perhaps the problem is intended to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be a number.\n\nWait, let's try that approach again. If I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then I need to find the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\). So, from the first part, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, and from the second part, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20, as I calculated earlier. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) would be 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nBut the problem didn't specify \\(c^0\\), so maybe it's just 384. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable, which would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the entire second expansion, which is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems unlikely because coefficients are usually numerical. So, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nWait, but let me think again. The problem is: What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, perhaps the problem is considering the coefficient as a polynomial in \\(c\\), meaning that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems odd because the problem is asking for a coefficient, which is a number. So, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating this, and the problem is simply to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nBut to make sure, let me think of it as a product of two independent variables. So, when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a term in one polynomial is multiplied by the entire other polynomial. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial times the entire second polynomial. So, that would be 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that's a polynomial, not a number. So, perhaps the problem is intended to have \\(c\\) terms, and the coefficient is a polynomial. But that seems unlikely because the problem is asking for a coefficient, which is a number.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable, so the coefficient would be 6 times the entire second expansion, which is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, which doesn't make sense in this context.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is actually to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). That would make sense because then the coefficient would be a number. So, let me proceed under that assumption.\n\nSo, as I calculated earlier, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire product is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but let me check that again. If I'm looking for \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then from the first part, I have 6a^2b^2, and from the second part, I have 20c^0. So, multiplying them gives 6 * 20 a^2b^2c^0 = 120a^2b^2. So, the coefficient is 120.\n\nBut the problem didn't specify \\(c^0\\), so perhaps that's not what it's asking. Alternatively, maybe it's just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\), which would be 6 times the entire second expansion, but that's a polynomial, not a number. So, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable, which would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the entire second expansion, which is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems odd because the problem is asking for a coefficient, which is a number, not a polynomial.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, considering all possible powers of \\(c\\), which would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. So, that would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, that would be 384.\n\nBut let me think again. If I have two polynomials, P(a, b) and Q(c), then the product P(a, b) * Q(c) would have terms like term from P times term from Q. So, the coefficient of a specific term in P, say \\(a^2b^2\\), would be the coefficient of that term in P multiplied by the entire Q(c). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 * Q(c). But that's a polynomial in \\(c\\), not a number. So, perhaps the problem is intended to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be a number.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating \\(c\\) as a variable, which would mean that the coefficient is a polynomial, but that seems unlikely. So, perhaps the intended answer is 120, assuming that the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\).\n\nWait, but let me check the problem again. It says: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, it's possible that the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) irrespective of the power of \\(c\\), which would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be 120.\n\nI think I need to decide which approach is correct. Let me consider the problem statement carefully. It says, \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\". If the problem is in a context where multiple variables are involved, it's possible that it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), it's 120. But since the problem didn't specify \\(c^0\\), I think the intended answer is 384. So, I'll go with that.\n\nSo, to summarize: The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought that the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 64, which is correct because when \\(c = 1\\), \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). So, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), it's 120. But since the problem didn't specify \\(c^0\\), I think the intended answer is 384.\n\nWait, but let me check with the original problem again. It says: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) irrespective of \\(c\\), which would be 6 * 64 = 384. So, that's the answer.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let me calculate both possibilities and see which one makes sense.\n\nIf I consider the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, regardless of the power of \\(c\\), it's 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nIf I consider the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), it's 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nGiven that the problem didn't specify \\(c^0\\), I think the correct interpretation is that it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), which would be 384.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 384.\n\nWait, but let me think again. When you have two polynomials multiplied together, the coefficient of a term in one polynomial is multiplied by the entire other polynomial. So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, it's the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial times the entire second polynomial. So, that would be 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial. But since the problem is asking for a coefficient, which is a number, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable, so the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But that seems odd because the problem is asking for a coefficient, which is a number. So, perhaps the problem is intended to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be 120.\n\nWait, perhaps I should look for the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which would involve multiplying \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the sum over all k of (coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in first part) times (coefficient of \\(c^{6 - 2k}\\) in the second part). But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), that would mean summing over all possible k, which would give 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), that would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion, which is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nI think the confusion arises from whether the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) irrespective of \\(c\\) or specifically \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). Since the problem didn't specify \\(c^0\\), I think it's more likely that it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) irrespective of the power of \\(c\\), which would be 384.\n\nTherefore, after considering all possibilities, I conclude that the coefficient is 384.\n\nWait, but let me check with an example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Expanding, it's \\((a^2 + 2ab + b^2)(c + 1/c)\\). The coefficient of \\(ab\\) in the product would be 2 times (c + 1/c), which is 2c + 2/c. So, the coefficient of \\(ab\\) is 2c + 2/c, which is a polynomial. So, in this case, the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), not a number. So, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), it would be a polynomial in \\(c\\). But since the problem is asking for a coefficient, which is typically a number, perhaps it's intended to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be a number.\n\nIn that case, for the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is 120. So, perhaps that's the intended answer.\n\nWait, but let me check again. The problem is: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" If it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) irrespective of \\(c\\), then it's 6 * 64 = 384. If it's asking for \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), it's 120. Since the problem didn't specify \\(c^0\\), but in the example I just did, the coefficient of \\(ab\\) is a polynomial, which suggests that the problem is indeed asking for the coefficient as a polynomial. So, perhaps the answer is 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that's a polynomial, not a number. So, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which"

Calculating those coefficients, \\(\\dbinom{4}{0} = 1\\), \\(\\dbinom{4}{1} = 4\\), \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\), \\(\\dbinom{4}{3} = 4\\), and \\(\\dbinom{4}{4} = 1\\). So, the expansion becomes \\(a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). \n\nWait, but the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Looking at the expansion, the term with \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(6a^2b^2\\), so the coefficient is 6. But hold on, the original expression isn't just \\((a + b)^4\\), it's multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I need to consider the entire expression: \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nHmm, so does that mean I need to multiply each term of \\((a + b)^4\\) by each term of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)? That seems like a lot of terms, but maybe I don't need to consider all of them. Since I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), perhaps I can find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and then multiply it by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but wait, no, that's not quite right because when you multiply two expressions together, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression. \n\nBut in this case, I think the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from those involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, the variables \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are only in the first part, and \\(c\\) is only in the second part. That means that when I multiply the two expansions together, the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) won't affect the terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, maybe the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that doesn't seem quite right because the problem is asking for a single coefficient, not a product of coefficients. \n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think again. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when you expand this, each term will be of the form \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}a^{4 - k}b^k \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - m}\\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying the exponents for \\(c\\), that becomes \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}\\dbinom{6}{m}a^{4 - k}b^k c^{6 - 2m}\\). \n\nNow, I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). That means I need \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\), so \\(k = 2\\). So, the coefficient from the first part is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Now, since the variables \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are only in the first part, the second part involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) will multiply this coefficient, but since the problem doesn't specify any condition on \\(c\\), perhaps we just need the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). Wait, but that can't be right because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so maybe the entire expression is being considered, and we need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which would include all possible terms from the second expansion. \n\nWait, no, that's not possible because \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are in the first part, and \\(c\\) is in the second part. So, when you multiply them, the variables \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are all separate. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by every possible term from the second expansion, which is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is \\(2^6 = 64\\), but that doesn't seem right because the problem is asking for a specific coefficient, not a product.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)\". So, the variables are \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\), and the term we're looking for is \\(a^2b^2\\) times any possible power of \\(c\\). But that can't be, because then the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is indeed 6 * 64 = 384. But that seems too straightforward, and I think I might be missing something.\n\nWait, but maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, because \\(a^2b^2\\) alone doesn't specify anything about \\(c\\). So, perhaps I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would mean that the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. Let me check that. If that's the case, then I need to find the term where, in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. \n\nSo, in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - m} \\times \\left(1/c\\right)^m = \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\). The exponent of \\(c\\) is \\(6 - 2m\\), and we want this to be zero, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which gives \\(m = 3\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). \n\nNow, going back to the original expression, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the coefficient from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) where \\(c^0\\) is selected. So, that would be 6 (from \\(a^2b^2\\)) times 20 (from \\(c^0\\)), which gives 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nWait, that makes sense because when you multiply the two expansions, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by each term from the second part, but only the term where \\(c^0\\) contributes to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). So, the coefficient would be 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nLet me just verify that. So, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. In \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Multiplying these together gives 6 * 20 = 120. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire expression is 120. \n\nWait, but the problem just says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", without specifying \\(c\\). So, maybe I'm overcomplicating it by considering \\(c^0\\). Perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), which would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which would be 6 * 64 = 384. But that seems too large, and I think the problem is more likely asking for the coefficient when considering all variables, including \\(c\\), so that the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any power of \\(c\\). \n\nWait, but that can't be, because \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term in the first part, and when multiplied by the second part, it would become \\(a^2b^2\\) times each term in the second expansion, so the coefficient would be 6 times each coefficient in the second expansion, but that would mean the entire expression would have multiple terms with \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by different powers of \\(c\\). Therefore, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then it's just 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 2^6 = 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nBut that seems too straightforward, and I think the problem is more likely asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nWait, let me check again. The problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\". It doesn't specify anything about \\(c\\), so perhaps it's just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, which would include all possible powers of \\(c\\). But that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial in \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually be a polynomial in \\(c\\), not a single number. That can't be right because the problem is asking for a coefficient, which is a number. \n\nTherefore, I must have made a mistake in interpreting the problem. Let me think again. Maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\). That would make sense because then the coefficient would be a single number. \n\nSo, to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), I need to find the term in the expansion where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\). \n\nAs I thought earlier, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. In \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. So, when I multiply these two parts together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by the term \\(20c^0\\) from the second part, giving \\(6 \\times 20 a^2b^2c^0 = 120a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient is 120.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. When you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial, which includes terms like \\(c^6\\), \\(6c^4\\), \\(15c^2\\), \\(20\\), \\(15c^{-2}\\), \\(6c^{-4}\\), and \\(c^{-6}\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by each of these, resulting in terms like \\(6a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(36a^2b^2c^4\\), \\(90a^2b^2c^2\\), \\(120a^2b^2\\), \\(90a^2b^2c^{-2}\\), \\(36a^2b^2c^{-4}\\), and \\(6a^2b^2c^{-6}\\). \n\nSo, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), that would correspond to the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, which is \\(120a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient is 120.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem had asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some specific \\(k\\), that would be a different coefficient. But since it just says \\(a^2b^2\\), I think it's safe to assume that it's asking for the coefficient when \\(c\\) is raised to the zero power, which is 120.\n\nLet me just recap to make sure I didn't miss anything. The first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), gives me \\(6a^2b^2\\). The second part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), gives me a term \\(20c^0\\). Multiplying these together gives \\(6 \\times 20 a^2b^2c^0 = 120a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient is 120.\n\nWait, but let me think again. If I didn't consider the \\(c\\) part, and just took the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) as 6, and then multiplied it by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), that would give me a polynomial where each term has \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by a term from the second expansion. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which I think refers to the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, because otherwise, the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense for a coefficient.\n\nSo, I think the correct approach is to find the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\), which gives the coefficient as 120. Therefore, the answer should be 120.\n\nWait, but let me check this with an example. Suppose I expand both parts separately and then multiply them, looking for the term \\(a^2b^2\\). \n\nFrom \\((a + b)^4\\), the term is \\(6a^2b^2\\). From \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term is \\(20c^0\\). So, multiplying these together, I get \\(6a^2b^2 \\times 20c^0 = 120a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient is indeed 120.\n\nAlternatively, if I consider the entire expansion, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384. But that would mean that the coefficient is 384, but that would imply that \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by all possible powers of \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because then the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would have a coefficient that's a polynomial in \\(c\\), not a single number. Therefore, I think the correct interpretation is that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nWait, but maybe I'm overcomplicating it again. Let me think differently. The problem is written as \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the entire expression is a product of two polynomials, one in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the other in \\(c\\). Therefore, when you multiply them, the variables are independent. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is multiplied by every term in the second part, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * (c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15c^{-2} + 6c^{-4} + c^{-6}). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times that polynomial, meaning that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for each \\(k\\) would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^k\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). \n\nBut the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which could be interpreted as the coefficient when considering all possible powers of \\(c\\), but that doesn't make sense because a coefficient is a scalar. Therefore, I think the problem must be asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is written in a way that it's just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which would mean that we consider the product as a single polynomial and find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). But in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial, not a single number. Therefore, that can't be the case.\n\nHence, I think the correct interpretation is that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nWait, but let me check this again. If I expand \\((a + b)^4\\), I get terms up to \\(a^4\\) and \\(b^4\\), and in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), I get terms from \\(c^6\\) down to \\(c^{-6}\\). So, when I multiply these, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each of these \\(c\\) terms, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), etc., up to \\(a^2b^2c^{-6}\\). Therefore, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), without specifying \\(c\\), it's ambiguous. But in most cases, when a problem asks for the coefficient of a term with certain variables, it's implied that the other variables are at their lowest power, which is usually zero. So, I think it's safe to assume that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem is part of a larger context where \\(c\\) is being held constant or something, but I don't think that's the case here.\n\nSo, to summarize, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 20. Multiplying these together gives 6 * 20 = 120, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is 120. Therefore, the answer is 120.\n\nWait, but let me just make sure I didn't make any calculation errors. \n\nCalculating \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\): 6! / (3! * 3!) = (720) / (6 * 6) = 720 / 36 = 20. That's correct.\n\nAnd \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) is 6, which is correct. So, 6 * 20 = 120. That seems right.\n\nI think I've considered all angles here, and the answer should be 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplying it by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20. Thus, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\boxed{120}."

    "text": " Let me write that out using the binomial theorem.\n\nSo, \\((a + b)^4 = \\dbinom{4}{0}a^4b^0 + \\dbinom{4}{1}a^3b^1 + \\dbinom{4}{2}a^2b^2 + \\dbinom{4}{3}a^1b^3 + \\dbinom{4}{4}a^0b^4\\). Calculating the coefficients, that would be \\(1 \\cdot a^4 + 4 \\cdot a^3b + 6 \\cdot a^2b^2 + 4 \\cdot ab^3 + 1 \\cdot b^4\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) here is 6. \n\nWait, but the original expression isn't just \\((a + b)^4\\), it's multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Hmm, so I need to consider the entire product. I think that when you multiply two expressions together, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression. But since I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), maybe I don't need to worry about the terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), because \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't have any \\(c\\) terms. So, perhaps the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is just the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, no, that doesn't make sense because when you multiply, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) gets multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but since I'm only looking for terms where the variables are \\(a^2b^2\\), the \\(c\\) terms would have to multiply in such a way that they don't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) exponents. \n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again. The problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but the expression is a product of two separate binomial expansions. So, perhaps I can treat each part separately. The first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), when expanded, has a term with \\(a^2b^2\\) which we found has a coefficient of 6. The second part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), maybe the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is just 6 times the sum of all terms in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that doesn't seem right because each term in the first expansion gets multiplied by each term in the second expansion, so the coefficient would actually be 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nWait, but actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), maybe the coefficient is just 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, but that can't be right because each term in the product would have both \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms and \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\) terms. Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Let me try to think differently.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider that when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term is the product of the coefficients of the terms that multiply to give that term. But in this case, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), and the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), contributes a factor that is a polynomial in \\(c\\). So, perhaps the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because when you multiply, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second, so the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the sum of all coefficients in the second part, since the second part doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) exponents.\n\nWait, but actually, when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term is the sum over all products of coefficients from each polynomial where the variables multiply to give the desired term. But in this case, since the second polynomial only has \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), which are different variables from \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) can only come from the first polynomial, and the second polynomial contributes a factor that is a sum of terms with \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), but since we are looking for a term that has no \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), perhaps only the constant term in the second polynomial would contribute. Wait, but that's not correct because \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term without \\(c\\), so any term in the second polynomial that has a non-zero power of \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\) would multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) to give a term with \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), which we don't want. Therefore, the only way to get a term with \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\) is to multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by the constant term in the second polynomial, which is the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero.\n\nSo, let me check that. The second polynomial is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem, this can be expanded as \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). The constant term occurs when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which implies \\(k = 3\\). So, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} c^{0} = 20\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, that seems plausible, but let me double-check. Alternatively, maybe I can think of it as the entire product being \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), and since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) can only come from the product of the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in \\((a + b)^4\\) and any term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but since we don't want any \\(c\\) terms, only the constant term in the second polynomial would contribute. Therefore, the coefficient would be 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (the constant term in the second part), giving 120.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can consider that the entire product is a product of two independent expansions, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, but that would be incorrect because the second expansion's terms affect the \\(c\\) part, not the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) part. So, actually, the correct approach is to take the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion and multiply it by the constant term in the second expansion because only the constant term doesn't introduce any \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\) factors. Therefore, 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. Let me think again: when you have two polynomials multiplied together, say \\(P(a, b) \\times Q(c)\\), then any term in the product \\(P(a, b) \\times Q(c)\\) will have variables from both polynomials. So, if I'm looking for a term that only has \\(a^2b^2\\), it must come from a term in \\(P(a, b)\\) that is \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by a term in \\(Q(c)\\) that is a constant (i.e., \\(c^0\\)). Therefore, the coefficient is indeed the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(P(a, b)\\) and the constant term in \\(Q(c)\\). So, yes, that would be 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but just to be thorough, let me compute the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). As I did earlier, using the binomial theorem, the expansion is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\times c^{-k} = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). The exponent \\(6 - 2k\\) is zero when \\(k = 3\\). So, the term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} c^{0} = 20\\), so the constant term is 20.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but let me consider another approach to confirm. Alternatively, I can think of the entire expression as a product of two polynomials and consider that each term in the product is a combination of terms from each polynomial. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) can only come from \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and any term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but since we don't want any \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), the only way is to multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by the constant term in the second polynomial, which is 20. So, the coefficient would be 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can compute the entire product and see, but that might be too time-consuming. Alternatively, I can think of the problem as two separate parts and compute each part's contribution. Since the variables \\(a, b\\) and \\(c\\) are independent, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part, which is indeed 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but just to be thorough, let me compute the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) and check the constant term again. So, using the binomial coefficients:\n\n- When k=0: \\(\\dbinom{6}{0}c^6 = 1 \\times c^6\\)\n- k=1: \\(\\dbinom{6}{1}c^4 = 6c^4\\)\n- k=2: \\(\\dbinom{6}{2}c^2 = 15c^2\\)\n- k=3: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}c^0 = 20\\)\n- k=4: \\(\\dbinom{6}{4}c^{-2} = 15c^{-2}\\)\n- k=5: \\(\\dbinom{6}{5}c^{-4} = 6c^{-4}\\)\n- k=6: \\(\\dbinom{6}{6}c^{-6} = 1c^{-6}\\)\n\nSo, the constant term is indeed 20 when k=3.\n\nTherefore, putting it all together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but let me just make sure that I'm not missing any other contributions. For example, could there be a term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) that somehow affects the \\(a^2b^2\\) term? But no, because \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), so any term involving \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\) would result in a term that has both \\(a^2b^2\\) and some power of \\(c\\), which we don't want. Therefore, only the constant term in the second polynomial contributes to the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the product. So, yes, 6 * 20 = 120 is correct.\n\nI think that makes sense. So, the final answer is 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem for both parts of the expression.\n\nFirst, consider the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n\\]\nThe term \\(a^2b^2\\) occurs when \\(k = 2\\), which gives:\n\\[\n\\dbinom{4}{2} a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\n\\]\nSo, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\nNext, consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem:\n\\[\n\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n\\]\nThe constant term (where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero) occurs when \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\). The constant term is:\n\\[\n\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\n\\]\n\nSince the term \\(a^2b^2\\) does not involve \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient is:\n\\[\n6 \\times 20 = 120\n\\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}."

Calculating the coefficients, that would be \\(1 \\cdot a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + 1b^4\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in this part is 6. Okay, got that.\n\nNow, the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product of these two expansions. Wait, but \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are variables separate from \\(c\\), right? So, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) won't interact with the terms involving \\(c\\). That is, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in \\((a + b)^4\\) will just be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is 6, and then multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), right?\n\nWait, no, actually, when you multiply two expressions together, each term in the first expression is multiplied by each term in the second expression. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part will be multiplied by every term in the second expansion. But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), that seems confusing. Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem.\n\nWait, actually, no. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, which is \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when you expand the entire expression, you'll have terms like \\(a^kb^{4 - k}\\) multiplied by terms like \\(c^m c^{-n}\\) or something. But the term \\(a^2b^2\\) itself doesn't involve \\(c\\), so perhaps the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But that would mean the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be a polynomial in \\(c\\), which seems odd because usually, coefficients are constants. Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating this.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). But that doesn't make much sense because \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term in the first part, and when multiplied by the second part, which is a polynomial in \\(c\\), each term in the product will have both \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) parts and \\(c\\) parts. So, maybe the question is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times any power of \\(c\\). But that would still mean the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\), which is not a single number. Hmm, that doesn't seem right.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misinterpreting the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, perhaps the problem is to treat both variables \\(a, b\\) and \\(c\\) together, but I'm only interested in the coefficient of the term where \\(a\\) is squared and \\(b\\) is squared, regardless of the power of \\(c\\). But that would mean that the coefficient would be a sum over all the terms in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each multiplied by 6, because the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6.\n\nWait, but that would mean the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which seems too broad. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times a specific power of \\(c\\), but the problem doesn't specify. Hmm, maybe I'm missing something here.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is written incorrectly, or maybe I'm misinterpreting it. Let me check again: it says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)\". So, perhaps the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is considered along with any power of \\(c\\), so the coefficient would be the sum of all the coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) multiplied by 6. But that would give me 6 times the sum of the coefficients of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 6 times \\(2^6 = 6 \\times 64 = 384\\). But that seems too large, and I'm not sure if that's what the problem is asking.\n\nWait, maybe I should consider that when you multiply the two expansions, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, which has terms like \\(c^6\\), \\(6c^4\\), \\(15c^2\\), \\(20\\), \\(15c^{-2}\\), \\(6c^{-4}\\), \\(c^{-6}\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients from the second part. Because each term in the second part is being multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^6\\) would be 6, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^4\\) would be 6 times 6, and so on.\n\nWait, but the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), without specifying any power of \\(c\\). So, perhaps it's considering all the terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any power of \\(c\\), and the coefficient would be the sum of all those coefficients. So, that would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). The sum of the coefficients in a polynomial is found by setting all variables to 1. So, substituting \\(c = 1\\) into \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the sum of the coefficients is 64, so 6 times 64 is 384. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 384.\n\nBut wait, let me think again. Is that correct? Because when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in one polynomial times another polynomial would be the coefficient times the entire second polynomial. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would have a coefficient that's 6 times each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times each coefficient in the second polynomial. But if the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then it's 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial. Which is 6 times 64, which is 384.\n\nBut I'm a bit unsure because usually, when we talk about the coefficient of a term in a product of polynomials, we specify both variables. But in this case, the problem is only specifying \\(a^2b^2\\), so perhaps it's considering the entire coefficient, which includes the \\(c\\) terms. But that seems unlikely because \\(c\\) is another variable, so the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\). Alternatively, maybe the problem is only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without considering \\(c\\), which would mean it's 6 times the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\).\n\nWait, that makes more sense. Because if you're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), you might be considering the term where the power of \\(c\\) is zero, i.e., the constant term. So, let me check that.\n\nIn \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the constant term is the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. Using the binomial theorem, the expansion is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(1/c\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, the exponent of \\(c\\) is \\(6 - 2k\\). We want this exponent to be zero, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (the constant term from the second part), giving 120.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it might be 384, but that was when I considered the sum of all coefficients. But perhaps the problem is specifically asking for the coefficient when \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\), i.e., the constant term. So, that would make the coefficient 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nLet me verify this approach. So, in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), when you expand it, each term will be of the form \\(a^kb^{4 - k} \\times c^{m}c^{-n}\\), but more precisely, each term is \\(a^kb^{4 - k} \\times c^{6 - 2k}\\) for some k from 0 to 6. Wait, no, that's not correct. Because in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - m} \\times (1/c)^m = \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\), where m ranges from 0 to 6.\n\nWait, perhaps I should think of it as for each term in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is \\(a^kb^{4 - k}\\), and for each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, when you multiply these together, you get terms like \\(a^kb^{4 - k} \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\). Now, if we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), that occurs when \\(k = 2\\) in the first part, because \\(a^2b^{4 - 2} = a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient from the first part is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Now, when we multiply this by each term in the second part, which is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the sum of \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\) for all m, because each term in the second part is multiplied by 6. But that would again give 6 times 64, which is 384, as before.\n\nBut wait, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then it's 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But that seems unlikely because usually, when you ask for the coefficient of a term, you're considering the coefficient in front of that term, regardless of other variables. So, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), i.e., the constant term in \\(c\\). That would make sense because then the coefficient would be a constant, not a polynomial.\n\nSo, if that's the case, then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\) would be 6 times the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). As I calculated earlier, the constant term is 20, so 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because the problem didn't specify any power of \\(c\\). So, maybe I should consider that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But that seems odd because the problem is asking for a coefficient, which is typically a constant. So, perhaps I need to clarify whether the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), or if it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some specific \\(k\\). Since the problem doesn't specify, I think the intended interpretation is that it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times the constant term in \\(c\\), i.e., the term where \\(c\\) is raised to the zero power. So, that would be 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is intended to have the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) as a standalone term, and the rest of the expression is just multiplied in, but that doesn't make much sense because the expression is a product. So, perhaps the correct approach is to consider that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which would mean the coefficient is 6 times each term in that expansion. But that would result in the coefficient being a polynomial in \\(c\\), which seems unusual.\n\nWait, perhaps I should think of it differently. When you have two polynomials multiplied together, the coefficient of a specific term in one polynomial is the product of that term's coefficient and the entire second polynomial. So, for example, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that seems too broad because the problem is asking for a coefficient, which is usually a single number.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and not considering the second part. But that can't be right because the entire expression is the product of both parts. So, perhaps the problem is expecting the coefficient to be 6 times the sum of the coefficients of the second part, which is 6 * 64 = 384. But I'm not entirely sure.\n\nWait, let me try to compute the entire expansion to see what the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is. So, when you expand \\((a + b)^4\\), you get terms up to \\(a^4b^0\\) and \\(a^0b^4\\). When you multiply this by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which expands to terms from \\(c^6\\) down to \\(c^{-6}\\), each term in the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), etc., each with their own coefficients. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^6\\) would be 6 * 1 = 6, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^4\\) would be 6 * 6 = 36, and so on, up to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^{-6}\\) would be 6 * 1 = 6.\n\nBut if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then it's the sum of all these coefficients, which is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). As I calculated earlier, the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 384.\n\nBut wait, that seems high. Let me check again. The sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is indeed 2^6 = 64 because substituting c = 1 gives (1 + 1)^6 = 64. So, 6 * 64 = 384. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 384.\n\nBut now I'm confused because earlier I thought it might be 120. Let me reconcile this. If the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then it's 384. If it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it's 120. Since the problem doesn't specify, I think the intended answer is 120, because when you're asked for the coefficient of a term in a product, you usually consider the term with all variables specified. But in this case, only \\(a^2b^2\\) is specified, so perhaps it's considering the coefficient as a polynomial in \\(c\\), which would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that seems unlikely because the problem is asking for a coefficient, not a polynomial.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is intended to have the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms, so the constant term in \\(c\\). That would make the coefficient 6 * 20 = 120. I think that's the more reasonable answer because otherwise, the coefficient would be a polynomial, which doesn't seem to fit the standard terminology.\n\nLet me confirm this approach. So, to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, we look at the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 20. So, 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient is 120.\n\nYes, that makes sense because if we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) and not any specific power of \\(c\\), then we're looking for the term where the power of \\(c\\) is zero, i.e., the constant term. So, the answer should be 120.\n\nWait, but to make sure, let me think of it another way. If I were to collect all the terms in the product that have \\(a^2b^2\\), each of these terms would be \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by some power of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^k\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms would be the sum over all k of (6 times the coefficient of \\(c^k\\)). But that's not quite right because each term is separate. Actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) is 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^k\\). So, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), that would be the sum of all coefficients of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for all k, which is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nBut that seems to contradict the earlier approach where I considered only the constant term. So, perhaps the problem is ambiguous. However, given that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without specifying any power of \\(c\\), I think it's more likely that they want the coefficient when \\(c\\) is raised to the zero power, i.e., the constant term. Therefore, the coefficient would be 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and not considering the second part. But that can't be right because the entire expression is the product of both parts. So, the coefficient must involve both parts.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider that the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, meaning the coefficient as a polynomial in \\(c\\). So, the coefficient would be 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 times the entire expansion. But that would make the coefficient a polynomial, which seems odd because the problem is asking for a coefficient, not a polynomial expression.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is intended to have the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) as a standalone term, which would require that the power of \\(c\\) is zero. So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 20, giving 120.\n\nYes, that seems to make sense. So, the answer is 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem for both parts of the expression.\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term involving \\(a^2b^2\\) is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\n   \\]\n   So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\n2. **Consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n   \\]\n   We need the constant term (where the power of \\(c\\) is zero).

    "text": " Let me write that out using the binomial theorem.\n\nSo, \\((a + b)^4 = \\dbinom{4}{0}a^4b^0 + \\dbinom{4}{1}a^3b^1 + \\dbinom{4}{2}a^2b^2 + \\dbinom{4}{3}a^1b^3 + \\dbinom{4}{4}a^0b^4\\). Calculating the coefficients, that becomes \\(1 \\cdot a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + 1 \\cdot b^4\\). Okay, so if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), that's 6. Wait, but hold on, the problem isn't just \\((a + b)^4\\), it's multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Hmm, so I need to consider both parts together.\n\nWait, so the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when you multiply two expressions together, each term from the first expression gets multiplied by each term from the second expression. But since I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), maybe I can find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and then consider how it interacts with the second part.\n\nWait, no, that's not quite right. Because when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first polynomial multiplies each term in the second. So, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first part will be multiplied by every term in the second part, which is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since I'm only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I need to make sure that when I multiply by the second part, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term remains as \\(a^2b^2\\). That is, the second part shouldn't affect the powers of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), because it only involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\).\n\nWait, that makes sense. So, the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), when expanded, will only have terms involving powers of \\(c\\), such as \\(c^6\\), \\(c^5\\), down to \\(c^{-6}\\), but none of these will affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. Therefore, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first part will get multiplied by each term in the second part, but since each term in the second part is a power of \\(c\\), the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will remain as \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by some power of \\(c\\).\n\nWait, but the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not considering \\(c\\). Hmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Wait, no, the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, perhaps I need to consider all the terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any term from the second part, and then sum all those coefficients together.\n\nBut wait, that seems complicated. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, considering all possible powers of \\(c\\). But that might not make sense because \\(a^2b^2\\) is only from the first part, and the second part contributes only to the \\(c\\) terms. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Because each term in the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part, so \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by each term in the second part, but the coefficient would be the sum of all coefficients in the second part.\n\nWait, that might be the case. Let me think again. If I have \\((a + b)^4\\) times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), then when I expand it, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6a\u00b2b\u00b2. Then, when I multiply this by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is a sum of terms like \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - k}(1/c)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\\), so each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\\) for \\(k = 0\\) to 6.\n\nSo, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will be multiplied by each of these \\(c\\) terms, resulting in terms like \\(6a^2b^2 \\times \\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\\). But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), I think we're supposed to consider all possible coefficients of \\(a^2b^2c^{n}\\) for any \\(n\\), but sum their coefficients. Alternatively, maybe it's considering \\(a^2b^2\\) as a term without any \\(c\\), but that's not possible because the second part introduces \\(c\\) terms.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Perhaps the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, but since \\(c\\) is separate, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Because each term in the second part contributes a coefficient that multiplies the \\(a^2b^2\\) term.\n\nWait, let me test this. The sum of all coefficients in the second part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), is found by setting \\(c = 1\\). So, substituting \\(c = 1\\), we get \\((1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of all coefficients in the second part is 64.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by 64. Since the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6, then 6 * 64 = 384. So, the coefficient would be 384.\n\nWait, but let me double-check this because I might have made a mistake. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), which would indeed be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which is 64, giving 384. But let me make sure I'm not missing anything.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm supposed to consider that the entire expression is a product, and when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum of the products of the coefficients of terms that multiply together to give that specific term. But in this case, since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are independent of those involving \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would indeed be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part.\n\nWait, that makes sense because when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Because each term in the second part contributes its own coefficient, and since they're multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), the total coefficient is the product.\n\nSo, yes, that seems correct. Therefore, the coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384. So, I think that's the answer.\n\nWait, but let me just go through it again more carefully to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nFirst, expand \\((a + b)^4\\). The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Correct.\n\nNext, expand \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). The sum of all coefficients in this expansion is obtained by setting \\(c = 1\\), so \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of coefficients is 64.\n\nTherefore, when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me think about this differently. Suppose I didn't consider the sum of coefficients, but instead thought about the product as a two-variable polynomial in \\(a, b, c\\). Then, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by every term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which would result in 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But when we're just looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), we're effectively summing over all possible coefficients from the second expansion, which is exactly the sum of the coefficients, which is 64. So, 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem had asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some specific \\(k\\), then it would be different. But since it's just \\(a^2b^2\\), without any restriction on \\(c\\), the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which is 64, giving 384.\n\nWait, another way to think about it: when you have two polynomials, \\(P(a, b)\\) and \\(Q(c)\\), their product \\(P(a, b) \\times Q(c)\\) will have terms where each term of \\(P\\) is multiplied by each term of \\(Q\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(P(a, b)\\) is 6, and when you multiply by \\(Q(c)\\), each term in \\(Q(c)\\) contributes a coefficient that multiplies the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. So, the total coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(Q(c)\\), which is 64. So, 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So, I think the coefficient is 384.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{384}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem.\n\nFirst, we expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n\\]\nThe term containing \\(a^2b^2\\) is:\n\\[\n\\dbinom{4}{2} a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\n\\]\nSo, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\nNext, we consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).

The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and the sum of all coefficients in the second part.\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is:\n\\[\n6 \\times 64 = 384\n\\]\n\nThe final answer is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{384}\n\\]"

    "text": " Let me write that out.\n\nSo, expanding \\((a + b)^4\\), I can use the binomial coefficients. The expansion will have terms from \\(a^4\\) down to \\(b^4\\), each multiplied by the corresponding binomial coefficient. The general term will be \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\\) where \\(k\\) goes from 0 to 4. Now, since I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), that means I need the term where \\(a\\) is squared and \\(b\\) is squared. So, let me see: \\(4 - k = 2\\) which means \\(k = 2\\). So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\).\n\nCalculating \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\), that's \\(\\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient is 6. Okay, that's straightforward. So, in the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6.\n\nNow, the problem is that this is multiplied by another expression, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but since the second part is in terms of \\(c\\), I wonder if this affects the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, actually, no. Because \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), so when I multiply the two expressions together, the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are independent of the terms involving \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression will just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but since we're only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), the \\(c\\) terms don't interfere. Wait, is that right?\n\nWait, no, actually, no. Because when you multiply two expressions together, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression. So, if I have \\((a + b)^4\\) expanded and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) expanded, then each term like \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part will be multiplied by every term in the second part. But since we are only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), we need to make sure that when we multiply, the terms involving \\(c\\) don't affect the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. Hmm, actually, no, that's not quite right. Because \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term that doesn't have any \\(c\\) in it, so when we multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), it would create terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), etc., but none of these would be \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be zero because when you multiply by the other expression, you can't get rid of the \\(c\\) terms. But that doesn't make sense because the original problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so maybe I'm misunderstanding something.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again. The problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term is the product of the coefficients of the terms in each polynomial that multiply together to give that specific term. So, in this case, \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term in the first polynomial, and it's multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. But since the second polynomial is in terms of \\(c\\), and \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term without \\(c\\), the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is if it's multiplied by the constant term (i.e., the term with \\(c^0\\)) in the second polynomial. Because if you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by \\(c^k\\), you get \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), which is not \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second polynomial.\n\nAh, that makes sense. So, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me work on that.\n\nSo, expanding \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem, each term will be \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k\\). Simplifying that, each term becomes \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} c^{-k} = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, the exponent of \\(c\\) in each term is \\(6 - 2k\\). We need the exponent to be 0 because we're looking for the constant term. So, set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\).\n\nCalculating \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\), that's \\(\\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20.\n\nNow, going back to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficients from each part. So, that's 6 (from \\((a + b)^4\\)) multiplied by 20 (from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)). So, 6 times 20 is 120.\n\nWait, but let me double-check that. So, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, and in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. So, when you multiply these two, you get 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120. That seems right.\n\nBut just to make sure, let me consider the entire expansion. So, \\((a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). And \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15/c^2 + 6/c^4 + 1/c^6\\). Now, when you multiply these two, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, \\(a^2b^2 * c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2 * 6c^4\\), and so on. But the only term that doesn't involve \\(c\\) is \\(a^2b^2 * 20\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 * 20 = 120. Yep, that seems correct.\n\nI think that's it. So, the coefficient is 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break down the problem into two parts using the binomial theorem.\n\nFirst, we consider the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\). Using the binomial theorem, the general term is given by:\n\\[\n\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n\\]\nWe need the term where \\(a^2b^2\\), which corresponds to \\(k = 2\\). The coefficient is:\n\\[\n\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\n\\]\n\nNext, we consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem, the general term is given by:\n\\[\n\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n\\]\nWe need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, which corresponds to \\(6 - 2k = 0\\) or \\(k = 3\\). The coefficient is:\n\\[\n\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\n\\]\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficients from each part:\n\\[\n6 \\times 20 = 120\n\\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}."

    "text": " Let me write that out using the binomial theorem.\n\nSo, \\((a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\\). That means each term in the expansion will be of the form \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\\) where \\(k\\) goes from 0 to 4. Now, I'm looking for the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2, so that would be \\(a^2b^2\\). To find this, I need to determine the value of \\(k\\) such that \\(4 - k = 2\\) for \\(a\\) and \\(k = 2\\) for \\(b\\). Let me solve for \\(k\\): if \\(4 - k = 2\\), then \\(k = 2\\). So, the term with \\(a^2b^2\\) is when \\(k = 2\\). Therefore, the coefficient for this term is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\\). So, the coefficient from the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), for \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6.\n\nNow, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Since the second part is multiplied by the first, I need to consider how this affects the coefficient. But wait, I'm only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). That means I don't need to worry about the \\(c\\) terms because \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\). So, the \\(c\\) part of the expression will just multiply the entire expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\), but since I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), the \\(c\\) terms won't affect it. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just the same as the coefficient from the first part, which is 6.\n\nWait, let me make sure I'm not missing something. The expression is a product of two binomial expansions: one in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and another in \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). Since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are independent variables from \\(c\\), when we multiply the two expansions, the coefficients for \\(a^2b^2\\) will remain the same because the \\(c\\) terms don't interact with \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). So, yes, the coefficient should just be 6.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of it as the entire expression being the product of two separate expansions, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the coefficient from the first expansion, and the second expansion's terms will multiply by other terms, but since we're only interested in \\(a^2b^2\\), we don't need to consider the \\(c\\) terms for this specific term. Therefore, the coefficient is 6.\n\nWait a second, but actually, no. Because the entire expression is the product of the two binomial expansions, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). However, since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), that means we can treat the two parts as separate. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), the multiplication by the second expansion doesn't affect it. Therefore, the coefficient remains 6.\n\nWait, that seems conflicting with my initial thought. Let me clarify. When you multiply two expressions, each term from the first expression is multiplied by each term from the second. So, for the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, it would be multiplied by each term in the second part, which are powers of \\(c\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), we need to consider all possible terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any power of \\(c\\). However, the problem doesn't specify any particular power of \\(c\\), so I think it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). But that would mean we need to sum over all possible coefficients from the second expansion, which might complicate things.\n\nWait, hold on, maybe I misread the problem. Let me check again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, it's just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). That means we need to find the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion multiplied by the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion. Wait, no, actually, no. Because each term in the product is a combination of terms from both expansions. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, which are terms like \\(c^k\\) or \\(c^{-k}\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is actually the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, the coefficient for each such term is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times the coefficient of \\(c^k\\) or \\(c^{-k}\\). But since we're just looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), it's actually the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. Because each term in the second expansion contributes a coefficient when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), and we need to sum all those contributions.\n\nWait, that makes sense. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, each term's coefficient adds to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product.\n\nSo, first, let's find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which we already found to be 6. Now, we need to find the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). How do we find the sum of the coefficients in a polynomial? Well, the sum of the coefficients is found by plugging in \\(c = 1\\) because that makes each term equal to its coefficient. So, let's compute \\(\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = (1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion is 64.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\nWait, but hold on, let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) is only present in the first expansion, and when we multiply it by each term in the second expansion, each of those will contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^k\\) or \\(c^{-k}\\). But if the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then yes, we need to sum all those contributions. So, effectively, the coefficient is 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, giving 384.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem had asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for a specific \\(k\\), then we would have needed to find the specific coefficient from the second expansion. But since it's just \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\), the coefficient is 6 times 64, which is 384.\n\nLet me check this again. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). When expanded, each term is of the form \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}a^{4 - k}b^k \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - m}(1/c)^m\\). Simplifying the second part, \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, each term in the product is \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}\\dbinom{6}{m}a^{4 - k}b^k c^{6 - 2m}\\).\n\nNow, we are interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). That means we need to find all terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present, regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\), so \\(k = 2\\). Then, for each such term, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\dbinom{6}{m}\\) where \\(m\\) can be from 0 to 6. Therefore, the total coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} \\times \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m}\\). We know that \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the total coefficient is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 64. Multiplying these together gives 6 \u00d7 64 = 384.\n\n\\boxed{384}"

So, I need to consider how this multiplication affects the coefficient.\n\nWait, but hold on, the second part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When I multiply the two expressions together, each term in the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But since I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I can consider that term separately. Because when I multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by any term in the second expansion, it will just be \\(a^2b^2\\) times something involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression will be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in the second expansion, right?\n\nWait, no, that doesn't sound right. Because the second expansion is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which, when expanded, has terms involving various powers of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, each term in the first expansion gets multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), when we multiply it by each term in the second expansion, each of those products will have a different power of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression will be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in the second expansion, because each term in the second expansion, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), will contribute to a different term in the product. So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) specifically would just be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion.\n\nWait, but actually, no. Because the second expansion is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me think again. The sum of the coefficients in any expansion is found by setting all variables to 1. So, if I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = (2)^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion is 64. Therefore, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 * 64 = 384. Wait, that seems high. Let me check that again.\n\nWait, but perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me approach it differently. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, as I found earlier. Now, when I multiply this by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the product will be a term from the first expansion multiplied by a term from the second expansion. So, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. Each of these products will be terms like \\(6a^2b^2 \\cdot \\text{(something with c)}\\). So, each of these terms will have a different power of \\(c\\), but the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product will be 6 multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients in the second expansion. Because each term in the second expansion is of the form \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - k}\\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\\), and the coefficient for each such term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}\\). So, the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion is when \\(c = 1\\), which is \\(2^6 = 64\\), as I thought before.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). So, the answer should be 384.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. Another way to think about it is that when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum of the products of the coefficients of terms that multiply together to give that specific term. In this case, since we're looking for \\(a^2b^2\\), and the second polynomial doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), the only term from the first expansion that can contribute to \\(a^2b^2\\) is the term \\(6a^2b^2\\). Then, this term is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, each of which has some power of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), each of these multiplications by the second expansion's terms will just contribute a multiple to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is \\(6 \\times\\) the sum of all the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64. So, 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but another way to think about it is that the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), the coefficients in one expansion don't affect the other. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6, and when you multiply by the entire second expansion, which has a sum of coefficients equal to 64, then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 * 64 = 384. That makes sense.\n\nWait, but let me check with a simpler example to make sure. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). So, expanding \\((a + b)^2\\) gives \\(a^2 + 2ab + b^2\\). The coefficient of \\(a^2b^0\\) is 1, \\(ab\\) is 2, and \\(b^2\\) is 1. Then, \\((c + 1/c)^1 = c + 1/c\\). The sum of coefficients in this is 1 + 1 = 2. So, when I multiply, the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) in the product would be 1 * 2 = 2, which is correct because \\((a + b)^2(c + 1/c)\\) would have terms like \\(a^2c\\), \\(a^2 \\cdot 1/c\\), so the coefficients for \\(a^2\\) would be 1 * c and 1 * 1/c, but if we're just looking for the coefficient, it's 1 times (1 + 1) = 2. Similarly, the coefficient of \\(ab\\) would be 2 * 2 = 4, and \\(b^2\\) would be 1 * 2 = 2. So, this method seems to work.\n\nTherefore, applying the same logic, in our original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me make sure that I'm not missing anything. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, even though the second expansion has terms with different powers of \\(c\\), when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), each of these terms will contribute to different terms in the final expansion, but the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) itself, when combined with any power of \\(c\\), is 6 times each coefficient in the second expansion. Wait, but actually, no, because each term in the second expansion is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), so the coefficient for each term in the product will be 6 times the coefficient from the second expansion. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), the total coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64. So, 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can think of it as the product of the two expansions. The first expansion has terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the second expansion has terms involving \\(c\\). Since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are independent variables, the coefficients for the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are independent of the coefficients involving \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is just the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion and the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. So, that would be 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but another way to think about it is that when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term is the sum of the products of the coefficients of terms that multiply together to form that specific term. In this case, the specific term is \\(a^2b^2\\), but since the second polynomial doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is by multiplying \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion by any term from the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. So, that's 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me compute the second expansion and see. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\\). The coefficients here are \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}\\) for each term. So, the sum of all coefficients is when \\(c = 1\\), which is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} = 2^6 = 64\\), as before.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is indeed 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me just think again. Suppose I have two polynomials, P(a, b) and Q(c). Then, the product P(a, b) * Q(c) will have terms where each term of P is multiplied by each term of Q. So, the coefficient of a specific term in P, say \\(a^2b^2\\), will be the same as in P, but multiplied by each term in Q. However, since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of c, each term in Q contributes a multiple to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\).

    "text": " Let me expand that first.\n\nAlright, so for \\((a + b)^4\\), the expansion will have terms from \\(a^4\\) down to \\(b^4\\). The coefficients will be the binomial coefficients for \\(n = 4\\). So, the expansion should look like:\n\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\dbinom{4}{0}a^4 + \\dbinom{4}{1}a^3b + \\dbinom{4}{2}a^2b^2 + \\dbinom{4}{3}ab^3 + \\dbinom{4}{4}b^4\n\\]\n\nCalculating the binomial coefficients:\n\n- \\(\\dbinom{4}{0} = 1\\)\n- \\(\\dbinom{4}{1} = 4\\)\n- \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\)\n- \\(\\dbinom{4}{3} = 4\\)\n- \\(\\dbinom{4}{4} = 1\\)\n\nSo, substituting these values back in, the expansion becomes:\n\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\n\\]\n\nGreat, so I can see that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. But wait, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). That means I need to consider how this term interacts with the expansion of the second part, which is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nHmm, so the entire expression is the product of two expansions. Therefore, when I multiply them together, each term in the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are variables separate from \\(c\\), any term involving \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\) won't affect the power of \\(a\\) or \\(b\\). So, actually, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part will just be multiplied by every term in the second expansion, but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), the rest of the variables (the \\(c\\) terms) don't matter for this specific coefficient. \n\nWait, is that right? Let me think again. When I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, when I collect all the terms, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) will be 6 multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients in the second expansion because each term in the second expansion, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), will contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times that term.\n\nWait, but actually, no. Because \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term in the first expansion, and when multiplied by any term in the second expansion, which is in terms of \\(c\\), the resulting term will have both \\(a^2b^2\\) and some power of \\(c\\). So, if we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the powers of \\(c\\), then the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because each term in the second expansion, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), will give a term with \\(a^2b^2\\) and some \\(c\\) term, but since we're only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), we need to sum all the coefficients from the second expansion.\n\nWait, is that correct? Let me think again. If I have \\(6a^2b^2\\) multiplied by, say, \\(c^6\\), that gives \\(6a^2b^2c^6\\). Similarly, \\(6a^2b^2\\) multiplied by \\(6c^4\\) (if that's a term) would give \\(36a^2b^2c^4\\), and so on. So, each term in the second expansion, when multiplied by \\(6a^2b^2\\), will produce a term with \\(a^2b^2\\) and some power of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product will be 6 multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients in the second expansion, because each term in the second expansion contributes its coefficient to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\).\n\nBut wait, the second expansion is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me expand that to find the sum of its coefficients. Alternatively, the sum of the coefficients in any expansion is found by plugging in 1 for all variables. So, if I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = (2)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the sum of all the coefficients in the second expansion is 64. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but that seems too straightforward. Let me double-check. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Since in the product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the first part, and when multiplied by each term in the second expansion, each term contributes to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times the coefficient of that term. Therefore, the total coefficient would indeed be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, giving 384. So, is 384 the correct coefficient?\n\nWait, but I'm not sure. Let me think again. Maybe I'm misunderstanding how the coefficients interact. Let me try another approach. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is actually the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is a polynomial in \\(c\\), when you multiply it by \\(a^2b^2\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because each term in the second expansion adds a multiple to \\(a^2b^2\\).\n\nWait, but if I think of it as the product of two polynomials, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is indeed the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial. Because when you multiply, each term in the second polynomial gets multiplied by each term in the first, so the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first is multiplied by every term in the second, each contributing their coefficient to the overall coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384. Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe I can think of it as the coefficient being 6 times the sum of the coefficients of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is indeed 64, so 6*64=384.\n\nWait, but let me check that again. The sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by substituting \\(c = 1\\), so that gives (1 + 1)^6 = 64, which is correct. So, yes, the sum of coefficients is 64, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6*64=384.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should think about the entire product and how the terms combine. But since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), the multiplication doesn't affect the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the entire second part, which is a polynomial in \\(c\\). Therefore, when considering the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the powers of \\(c\\), it's indeed 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, so 6*64=384.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not missing something. Let me try to compute it differently. Let's consider the entire product as:\n\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\n\\]\n\nWe can write this as:\n\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 \\times \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = (a + b)^4 \\times \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n\\]\n\nSo, each term in the second expansion is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\) for \\(k = 0\\) to \\(6\\).\n\nNow, when we multiply this by \\((a + b)^4\\), which has a term \\(6a^2b^2\\), the entire term becomes \\(6a^2b^2 \\times \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\).\n\nTherefore, in the product, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients from the second expansion. Because each term in the second expansion contributes its coefficient to the term \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient is 6 times the sum of \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}\\) for \\(k=0\\) to \\(6\\), which is 6*64=384.\n\nWait, but let me confirm the sum of the coefficients. The sum is when \\(c=1\\), so \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\), correct. So, yes, 6*64=384.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of it as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) being 6, and the second expansion contributes a factor of 64, so the total coefficient is 6*64=384.\n\nWait, but let me think again: is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product equal to the coefficient in the first part times the sum of the coefficients in the second part? Because when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum of the products of the coefficients of terms whose exponents add up to that term. But in this case, since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), the exponents of \\(c\\) don't affect the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is indeed the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial. Because each term in the second polynomial, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), adds its coefficient to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product.\n\nTherefore, I think 384 is the correct coefficient.\n\nWait, but let me try to compute it another way to be sure. Let me compute the product step by step.\n\nFirst, \\((a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\).\n\nSecond, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\).\n\nSo, when we multiply these two, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) from the first will be multiplied by each term in the second, which are \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\\) for \\(k=0\\) to \\(6\\).\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be 6 times the sum of all \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}\\) for \\(k=0\\) to \\(6\\), because each term \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\\) when multiplied by \\(6a^2b^2\\) gives \\(6 \\dbinom{6}{k} a^2b^2 c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the sum over \\(k=0\\) to \\(6\\) of \\(6 \\dbinom{6}{k}\\), which is 6 times the sum of \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}\\) from \\(k=0\\) to \\(6\\).\n\nBut the sum of \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}\\) from \\(k=0\\) to \\(6\\) is \\(2^6 = 64\\), so 6*64=384.\n\nWait, but let me compute the sum manually to confirm. The sum is \\(\\dbinom{6}{0} + \\dbinom{6}{1} + \\dbinom{6}{2} + \\dbinom{6}{3} + \\dbinom{6}{4} + \\dbinom{6}{5} + \\dbinom{6}{6}\\).\n\nCalculating each term:\n\n- \\(\\dbinom{6}{0} = 1\\)\n- \\(\\dbinom{6}{1} = 6\\)\n- \\(\\dbinom{6}{2} = 15\\)\n- \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\)\n- \\(\\dbinom{6}{4} = 15\\)\n- \\(\\dbinom{6}{5} = 6\\)\n- \\(\\dbinom{6}{6} = 1\\)\n\nAdding them up: 1 + 6 = 7; 7 + 15 = 22; 22 + 20 = 42; 42 + 15 = 57; 57 + 6 = 63; 63 + 1 = 64. Yes, that adds up to 64. So, 6*64=384.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 384.\n\nWait, but just to make sure I didn't make a mistake earlier, let me think about whether the term \\(a^2b^2\\) could be affected by other terms in the first expansion. For example, if I had \\(a^3b\\) multiplied by something, could that contribute to \\(a^2b^2\\)? But no, because when you multiply \\(a^3b\\) by any term in the second expansion, which is in \\(c\\), the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) would remain the same. So, \\(a^3b\\) times \\(c^k\\) would still be \\(a^3b c^k\\), which doesn't contribute to \\(a^2b^2\\). Similarly, \\(a^4\\) times anything would give \\(a^4\\) times something, which doesn't affect \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the only term in the first expansion that contributes to \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the \\(6a^2b^2\\) term, and its coefficient gets multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, giving 384.\n\nTherefore, I think 384 is the correct coefficient.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{384}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we start by expanding each part using the binomial theorem.\n\nFirst, we expand \\((a + b)^4\\):\n\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\dbinom{4}{0}a^4 + \\dbinom{4}{1}a^3b + \\dbinom{4}{2}a^2b^2 + \\dbinom{4}{3}ab^3 + \\dbinom{4}{4}b^4\n\\]\n\nCalculating the binomial coefficients, we get:\n\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\n\\]\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in this expansion is 6.\n\nNext, we consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).

Because the second part is in terms of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, when I multiply the two expansions, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part will be multiplied by every term from the second expansion. But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), that means I'm only interested in the part where \\(a^2b^2\\) isn't affected by the second expansion. Because if I multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by something else, it would change the variables, and I wouldn't have just \\(a^2b^2\\) anymore.

Wait, no, that doesn't seem right because the entire expression is a product, so the coefficients would combine.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when I expand this, each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term from the second expansion. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would be the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion. But wait, no, because if I multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by something else, it would create terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2c^{-k}\\), which aren't just \\(a^2b^2\\). So, actually, the only way to get a term with \\(a^2b^2\\) is if we multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by 1 from the second expansion. But wait, the second expansion doesn't have a constant term, does it?\n\nLet me check. The second part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem, this would be \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, the exponents of \\(c\\) are \\(6 - 2k\\) where \\(k\\) ranges from 0 to 6. Let me list out the terms:\n\n- When \\(k = 0\\), exponent is \\(6\\), term is \\(c^6\\)\n- \\(k = 1\\), exponent \\(4\\), term \\(c^4\\)\n- \\(k = 2\\), exponent \\(2\\), term \\(c^2\\)\n- \\(k = 3\\), exponent \\(0\\), term \\(1\\)\n- \\(k = 4\\), exponent \\(-2\\), term \\(c^{-2}\\)\n- \\(k = 5\\), exponent \\(-4\\), term \\(c^{-4}\\)\n- \\(k = 6\\), exponent \\(-6\\), term \\(c^{-6}\\)\n\nSo, the only constant term (with exponent 0) is when \\(k = 3\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20. Therefore, when I multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion by each term in the second expansion, the only term that will result in a pure \\(a^2b^2\\) term is when I multiply by the constant term 20. All other terms will have an extra \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\) factor, so they won't contribute to the \\(a^2b^2\\) term.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the coefficient from the first expansion (which is 6) multiplied by the constant term from the second expansion (which is 20). So, 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient is 120.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't miss anything. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is from the first part, and the second part's expansion only contributes a 20 when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\) to give \\(a^2b^2 \\times 20\\), which is 20a\u00b2b\u00b2. But is there a possibility that when multiplying by other terms, like \\(c^k\\) or \\(c^{-k}\\), we might end up with \\(a^2b^2\\) somehow? But no, because \\(c^k\\) or \\(c^{-k}\\) are separate variables, so unless \\(c^k\\) is 1, which only happens when \\(k = 3\\), we won't have a pure \\(a^2b^2\\) term. So, I think my reasoning is correct.\n\nJust to recap:\n\n1. Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is 6.\n2. Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem. The only term that doesn't introduce any \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\) is the constant term when \\(k = 3\\), which is 20.\n3. Multiply the two coefficients together: 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem.\n\nFirst, we expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n\\]\nThe term with \\(a^2b^2\\) is:\n\\[\n\\dbinom{4}{2} a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\n\\]\nSo, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\nNext, we consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem:\n\\[\n\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n\\]\nThe only term that does not involve \\(c\\) or \\(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\) is the constant term when \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which occurs at \\(k = 3\\).

    "text": " Let me write that out.\n\nSo, \\((a + b)^4 = \\dbinom{4}{0}a^4b^0 + \\dbinom{4}{1}a^3b^1 + \\dbinom{4}{2}a^2b^2 + \\dbinom{4}{3}a^1b^3 + \\dbinom{4}{4}a^0b^4\\). Calculating the coefficients, that would be:\n\n1. \\(\\dbinom{4}{0} = 1\\), so the first term is \\(a^4\\).\n2. \\(\\dbinom{4}{1} = 4\\), so the second term is \\(4a^3b\\).\n3. \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\), so the third term is \\(6a^2b^2\\).\n4. \\(\\dbinom{4}{3} = 4\\), so the fourth term is \\(4ab^3\\).\n5. \\(\\dbinom{4}{4} = 1\\), so the last term is \\(b^4\\).\n\nOkay, so in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. Got that part. Now, the expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I suppose I need to expand this part as well, but wait, I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Does the second part affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the overall expression? Hmm, maybe not directly, because \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\). So, perhaps when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) won't interfere with the terms involving \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, actually, when you multiply two expressions together, each term from the first expression gets multiplied by each term from the second expression. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not considering \\(c\\). Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating this.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, when you multiply the two expansions, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by every term in the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems too broad because the problem is probably expecting a numerical coefficient, not an expression in terms of \\(c\\). Maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem.\n\nWait, let me read the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, in other words, when you expand the entire product, collect all the terms that have \\(a^2b^2\\), and sum their coefficients. Since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which would make the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) equal to \\(6 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't seem right because the coefficient should be a number, not a polynomial in \\(c\\).\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misinterpreting the question. Maybe it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, but only considering the term \\(a^2b^2\\), and not worrying about the \\(c\\) terms. But that still doesn't make sense because the coefficient would then be a polynomial in \\(c\\). Alternatively, perhaps the question is expecting me to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating \\(c\\) as a constant, which would make the coefficient 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems a bit odd because usually, when we talk about coefficients, we consider all variables. Hmm.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think again. The problem is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When you multiply these two, each term in the first expansion will multiply each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part comes with a coefficient of 6, and when you multiply it by each term in the second expansion, each of those terms will have their own coefficients. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so perhaps it's just 6 times the entire second expansion, but that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, not a number. Hmm.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is only considering the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, so the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems complicated. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting me to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) and ignore the \\(c\\) terms, but that doesn't make much sense.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm making a mistake here. Let me try a different approach. Let me consider the entire product \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When I expand this, each term will be of the form \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}a^{4 - k}b^{k} \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - m}\\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\), which simplifies to \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}\\dbinom{6}{m} a^{4 - k}b^{k} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the sum over all \\(k\\) and \\(m\\) such that \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\), which gives \\(k = 2\\), and then \\(m\\) can be anything from 0 to 6 because \\(a^2b^2\\) is independent of \\(c\\). Wait, no, that's not quite right. Let me see: for the term \\(a^2b^2\\), we have \\(4 - k = 2\\), so \\(k = 2\\). So, the coefficient from the first part is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Then, from the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - m} \\times \\dfrac{1}{c^m} = \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the coefficient for each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\), and the exponent of \\(c\\) is \\(6 - 2m\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is independent of \\(c\\), perhaps we're supposed to sum over all \\(m\\) such that the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero? Wait, but the problem isn't asking about any specific power of \\(c\\), just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Hmm, this is confusing.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think again: when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each polynomial. So, in this case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial is 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) (i.e., the constant term) in the second polynomial is the sum of all the terms where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. So, to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, we need to multiply 6 by the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by the constant term, you get \\(a^2b^2 \\times \\text{constant}\\), which is the term we're interested in. Any other term involving \\(c\\) would result in a term that includes \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), which we don't want. So, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), i.e., the constant term. That would make sense.\n\nSo, first, find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6. Then, find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Then, multiply those two together to get the final coefficient.\n\nOkay, so let's work on finding the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, so set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n\nSo, the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Now, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\) with coefficient 6, and when multiplied by the constant term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20, gives 120. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120. That seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, let me think about it another way. When you have \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the expansion will be of the form \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}a^{4 - k}b^{k} \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - m}\\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying, that's \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}\\dbinom{6}{m}a^{4 - k}b^{k}c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, to get the term \\(a^2b^2\\), we need \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). So, \\(k = 2\\), and then the coefficient from the first part is 6. Then, for the second part, we can have any \\(m\\) such that \\(6 - 2m\\) is any exponent, but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), we have to sum over all possible \\(m\\), but that would make the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) equal to \\(6 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But that doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, not a polynomial. So, perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating \\(c\\) as a variable, but without considering the \\(c\\) terms. So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that seems too broad.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is expecting me to consider the entire product and find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by the constant term in \\(c\\). That would make sense, and that's what I did earlier, getting 120. So, perhaps the problem is implicitly asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it, and the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, so the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\). But that seems unlikely because the problem is probably expecting a numerical answer. So, I think the correct approach is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times the constant term in \\(c\\), which is 120.\n\nWait, let me check my calculations again. The constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, which occurs when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), so \\(m = 3\\). The coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Then, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). So, multiplying these together, 6 * 20 = 120. That seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should think about it differently. If I consider the entire product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by every term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which would give a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient, so perhaps it's expecting a numerical coefficient, which would only make sense if we're considering the constant term in \\(c\\), i.e., the term where \\(c^0\\). So, that would make the coefficient 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without considering \\(c\\), which would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that seems odd because the coefficient would then be a polynomial, not a number. So, I think the correct interpretation is that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nWait, another way to think about it: when you have two polynomials multiplied together, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum of the products of the coefficients of terms whose variables multiply to give that specific term. So, in this case, we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are only present in the first polynomial, the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) in the product will only come from the first polynomial. The second polynomial only has \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), so it doesn't affect the powers of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is simply the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial multiplied by the entire second polynomial. But that would make the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) equal to \\(6 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial. But the problem is asking for the coefficient, which is usually a number. Therefore, perhaps the problem is expecting me to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating \\(c\\) as a variable, and the coefficient would be 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems unlikely because the problem is probably expecting a numerical answer.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is only considering the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't make sense because the coefficient should be a number, not a polynomial. Therefore, I think the correct approach is that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, considering all possible powers of \\(c\\), but since the problem doesn't specify a particular power of \\(c\\), the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial. But since the problem is asking for the coefficient, it's probably expecting a numerical value, so perhaps it's assuming that we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when considering the constant term in \\(c\\), which is 120.\n\nWait, let me check this again. If I consider the product \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), then the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes with a coefficient of 6 from the first part. Now, when multiplied by the entire second polynomial, each term in the second polynomial will multiply 6, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the entire second polynomial. But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which is not a single number. Therefore, the problem must be asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by the constant term in \\(c\\). That would make the coefficient 6 * 20 = 120, as calculated earlier.\n\nSo, I think the correct answer is 120.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't miss anything. The problem is: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, it's just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\). So, in the product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).

Therefore, the problem must be expecting me to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when considering the entire product, which would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems odd because the problem is asking for a coefficient, which is usually a number. Therefore, perhaps the problem is only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and the second part is just 1, but that doesn't make sense because \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is not 1.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating \\(c\\) as a variable, so the coefficient would be 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems too complicated.

Therefore, perhaps the problem is expecting me to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when the entire product is expanded, but only considering terms where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, i.e., the constant term. That would make the coefficient 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it, and the problem is simply expecting me to recognize that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the same as the coefficient in the first part, which is 6, because the second part doesn't affect \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). But that can't be right because the second part is multiplied by the first part, so the coefficient would be 6 times the entire second expansion. But that would make the coefficient a polynomial, not a number.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and the second part is just 1, so the answer is 6. But that seems incorrect because \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is not 1.\n\nWait, maybe I should look at the problem again: it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. So, when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a term in the product is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each polynomial. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial comes with a coefficient of 6, and the term \\(c^0\\) in the second polynomial comes with a coefficient of 20. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product is 6 * 20 = 120. But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), without specifying anything about \\(c\\). So, does that mean it's considering all possible powers of \\(c\\)? In that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial. But the problem is asking for a coefficient, which is a number, so perhaps it's expecting me to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting me to consider that \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are independent of \\(c\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is simply 6 times the entire second polynomial, but that seems unlikely because the problem is probably expecting a numerical answer.\n\nWait, maybe I should think of it as a generating function. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that's a polynomial in \\(c\\). If the problem is expecting a numerical coefficient, perhaps it's considering the constant term, so 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nI think I've spent enough time thinking through this. I'm going to conclude that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplying it by the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20. Therefore, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\boxed{120}"

    "text": " Let me write that out.\n\nSo, expanding \\((a + b)^4\\), it would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{0}a^4b^0 + \\dbinom{4}{1}a^3b^1 + \\dbinom{4}{2}a^2b^2 + \\dbinom{4}{3}a^1b^3 + \\dbinom{4}{4}a^0b^4\\). Calculating the coefficients, that would be \\(1a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + 1b^4\\). Okay, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) here is 6. But wait, the original problem is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I think I need to consider both parts of the expression.\n\nBut the question is specifically asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Hmm, so does that mean I don't need to worry about the \\(c\\) terms? Because \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), right? So, maybe I can just find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) and then multiply it by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that doesn't make sense because when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. So, actually, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part would be multiplied by every term in the second part. But since the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), that would mean that \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by the constant term in the second expansion, right? Because if it's multiplied by any term with \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), the result would have \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or something, but the problem only wants \\(a^2b^2\\), so the coefficient would come from when it's multiplied by the constant term in the second expansion.\n\nSo, let me think. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6, as I found earlier. Then, I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The constant term is the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. So, when expanding \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), using the binomial theorem again, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, we want the exponent of \\(c\\) to be zero, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\), which is 20. So, the constant term is 20.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficients from each part, which is 6 (from \\(a^2b^2\\)) multiplied by 20 (the constant term). So, 6 times 20 is 120. Therefore, the coefficient is 120.\n\nWait, let me double-check that. So, in the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\), which is 6. In the second part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the constant term is when \\(k = 3\\), so \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, when we multiply the two expansions together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, but only the constant term contributes to \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms. So, the coefficient is 6 times 20, which is 120. Yeah, that seems right.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of the entire expression as a product of two independent expansions. So, when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficients multiply. So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the constant term of the second polynomial, which is 20, giving 120. Yeah, that makes sense.\n\nWait, another way to think about it: when you have two polynomials multiplied together, the coefficient of a specific term is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each polynomial. Since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), it's like the term in the first polynomial is \\(a^2b^2\\) and the term in the second polynomial is the constant term, so their product is \\(a^2b^2 \\times \\text{constant}\\), which is \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient is indeed 6 times 20, which is 120.\n\nI don't think I made any mistakes here. So, I think the coefficient is 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem.\n\nFirst, we expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n\\]\nThe term involving \\(a^2b^2\\) is:\n\\[\n\\dbinom{4}{2} a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\n\\]\nSo, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\nNext, we need to find the constant term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem, each term in the expansion is:\n\\[\n\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n\\]\nWe need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be zero, which occurs when \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(k = 3\\). The constant term is:\n\\[\n\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficients from each part:\n\\[\n6 \\times 20 = 120\n\\]\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}."
