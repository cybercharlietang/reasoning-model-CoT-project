So, when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since we only care about the term \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term without any \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), the only way to get such a term is to multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by the term in the second expansion that has \\(c^0\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part. That makes sense. So, I already found that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. Now, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).

Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the two coefficients I found: 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the second part). So, 6 times 20 is 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120. Let me just make sure I didn't make a mistake.

    "text": " So, first, I already found that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. Now, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me think about how to approach that. Again, I can use the binomial theorem for this. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k\\). Simplifying each term, that's \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} c^{-k}\\), which is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, each term has an exponent of \\(6 - 2k\\). We need the term where the exponent is 0, because \\(c^0\\) is what we want. So, set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the term where \\(k = 3\\) is the constant term. The coefficient for that term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Let me calculate that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Now, going back to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Since these two terms are multiplied together in the product, the overall coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Wait, let me double-check that. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first part, and the \\(c^0\\) term comes from the second part, so when you multiply them, you get \\(a^2b^2 \\times c^0\\), which is just \\(a^2b^2\\), and the coefficient is 6 times 20, which is 120. Hmm, that seems right. Alternatively, maybe I should think of the entire expression as the product of two expansions, and when you multiply them, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the product of the coefficients from each expansion, since the \\(c\\) terms don't interfere with \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). So, yeah, I think that's correct. So, putting it all together, the coefficient is 120. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't miss anything. Is there a possibility that other terms in the second expansion could contribute to \\(a^2b^2\\) when multiplied by terms from the first expansion? For example, if I took a term with \\(c\\) from the second expansion, would that affect the \\(a^2b^2\\) term? But no, because \\(a^2b^2\\) is independent of \\(c\\), so any term involving \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\) would result in a term that has \\(c\\) in it, which isn't part of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, only the constant term in the second expansion would multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first expansion to give a term that's purely \\(a^2b^2\\). So, yeah, I think my approach is correct. So, the coefficient is 120. Let me just recap the steps to make sure I didn't skip anything. First, expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is 6. Then, expand \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem, looking for the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, which is when \\(k = 3\\), giving a coefficient of 20. Multiply these two coefficients together: 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120. I think that's it.

So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Now, putting it all together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficients we found from each part.

Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 120. Wait, but let me just double-check to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.

Yeah, that seems right. I don't think I made any calculation errors there. So, I think the final answer is 120.\n\nWait, hold on. Let me make sure I'm not missing anything here. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product. So, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term from the first expansion gets multiplied by each term from the second. But since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), the only way to get a term that's just \\(a^2b^2\\) is to multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first expansion by the constant term (i.e., the term with \\(c^0\\)) from the second expansion. Because if you multiply by any other term from the second expansion, you'd end up with a term that has \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), which would make the entire term have those variables, not just \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). So, that means the coefficient is indeed the product of the two coefficients we found: 6 and 20, giving 120. I think that's correct. Let me see if there's another way to approach this problem, just to confirm.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to consider the entire expansion. When you multiply two polynomials, the coefficients multiply term by term. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be the sum over all possible ways to get \\(a^2b^2\\) by multiplying terms from each polynomial. But in this case, since the first polynomial is in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the second is in \\(c\\), the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) is by taking the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first polynomial and the constant term from the second polynomial. So, that's exactly what we did earlier. So, that confirms that the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think about the multinomial theorem, but I think that's complicating things unnecessarily here because the problem can be broken down into two separate binomial expansions. So, I think my initial approach is correct.\n\nWait, another thought: does the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product actually come from both the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in \\((a + b)^4\\) and the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\)? Yes, because when you multiply the two, you're essentially taking the product of those two terms, resulting in \\(a^2b^2\\) times 1 (since the constant term is just a number), so the coefficient is the product of the two coefficients. So, that makes sense.\n\nI think I've covered all the bases here.

    "text": " Let me write that down. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, as I found earlier. Now, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Hmm, okay, so let's expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem as well. The expansion would be \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying that, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m} = \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the exponent on \\(c\\) is \\(6 - 2m\\). We want the term where the exponent is 0, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Let me compute that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Now, putting it all together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficients from each part. That is, 6 (from \\((a + b)^4\\)) multiplied by 20 (from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)). So, 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120. Wait, let me double-check to make sure I didn't make a mistake. So, first, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Then, in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term with \\(c^0\\) is when \\(m = 3\\), which gives \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying 6 and 20 gives 120. So, I think that's correct. I don't see any mistakes in that reasoning. So, the final answer should be 120.\n\nWait a second, let me make sure I'm not missing anything. So, the original expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). When you expand this, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But since we're only interested in the term \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), we need to find the term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) that has \\(c^0\\), because when we multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by \\(c^0\\), we get \\(a^2b^2\\), which is the term we're looking for. If we had taken any other term from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), say \\(c^k\\), then the resulting term would be \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), which isn't just \\(a^2b^2\\). So, yes, we only need the constant term from the second polynomial. So, I think my reasoning is correct. Therefore, the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nJust to be thorough, let me write out the expansions a bit more explicitly. For \\((a + b)^4\\), the expansion is \\(a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6. For \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the expansion is \\(c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15/c^2 + 6/c^4 + 1/c^6\\). So, the constant term is 20. Therefore, when we multiply these two expansions, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion is multiplied by 20, giving \\(20a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient is 20 * 6 = 120. That seems correct.\n\nWait, another way to think about it: when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term is the product of the coefficients of the terms that multiply together to give that specific term. In this case, since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) is by multiplying \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first polynomial by the constant term (i.e., \\(c^0\\)) from the second polynomial. So, the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120. Yeah, that makes sense.\n\nLet me see if there's another way to approach this problem. Maybe by considering generating functions or something else, but I think the way I did it is straightforward. So, I think 120 is the correct answer. I don't see any errors in my reasoning.\n\nJust to make sure, let me compute \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) again: 4! / (2!2!) = (24)/(2*2) = 24/4 = 6. Correct. And \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\) is 6! / (3!3!) = (720)/(6*6) = 720/36 = 20. Correct. So, 6 * 20 = 120. Yep, that's right.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break down the problem into two parts using the binomial theorem.\n\nFirst, consider the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\). Using the binomial theorem, we have:\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n\\]\nWe need the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2, which corresponds to \\(k = 2\\). The coefficient for this term is:\n\\[\n\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\n\\]\n\nNext, consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).

We already found that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. Now, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let's expand that using the binomial theorem. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\).

Let me think if there's another way to approach this problem. Alternatively, maybe I can consider the entire expansion, but that would be more complicated because the expressions are multiplied together. But since we're only interested in \\(a^2b^2\\), and that term doesn't involve \\(c\\), the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) is by taking the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first polynomial and the constant term from the second polynomial. So, that makes sense. Therefore, the coefficient is indeed 6 times 20, which is 120. I think that's the answer. \n\nWait, just to make sure, let me recast the problem. Let me consider the product \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). When you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, to get a term with \\(a^2b^2\\), you have to take the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first polynomial and multiply it by the constant term (i.e., \\(c^0\\)) from the second polynomial. Since the second polynomial is in terms of \\(c\\), any other term would introduce a \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), which would mean the term isn't purely \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, yes, the coefficient is 6 times 20, which is 120. \n\nLet me also consider if there's any other term in the second polynomial that could contribute to \\(a^2b^2\\).

Therefore, I can be confident that 120 is the correct coefficient.\n\nAnother way to think about it is that the entire expression is a product of two independent binomial expansions. So, each term in the first expansion (\\(a + b)^4\\)) is multiplied by each term in the second expansion (\\(c + 1/c)^6\\)).

So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20.\n\nNow, going back to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) would be the product of the two coefficients we just found. That is, 6 (from \\(a^2b^2\\)) multiplied by 20 (from \\(c^0\\)). So, 6 times 20 is 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120.\n\nWait, let me just make sure I didn't make a mistake here. So, we're looking for the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which would come from taking \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part and the constant term from the second part. Since the second part doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms, it's just a scalar multiple, so we multiply the coefficients. That makes sense. So, yeah, 6 times 20 is indeed 120. I think that's the right answer.\n\nBut just to double-check, let me consider the entire expression. \\((a + b)^4\\) when expanded has terms from \\(a^4\\) down to \\(b^4\\), and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) when expanded has terms from \\(c^6\\) down to \\(c^{-6}\\). When we multiply these two polynomials together, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, for the term \\(a^2b^2\\), we only consider the term in \\((a + b)^4\\) that is \\(a^2b^2\\) and multiply it by every term in the second polynomial. However, since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), any term that includes \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\) won't contribute to \\(a^2b^2\\), because \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't have any \\(c\\) terms. Therefore, the only contribution comes from the constant term in the second polynomial, which is 20, so we multiply 6 by 20 to get 120. Yep, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of it another way. The entire expression is a product of two polynomials, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the sum over all possible products of coefficients from each polynomial that result in \\(a^2b^2\\). But since the second polynomial doesn't have any \\(a\\) or \\(b\\) terms, the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) is to take the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first polynomial and multiply it by the constant term from the second polynomial. So, that's exactly what I did earlier. So, 6 times 20 is 120. I think that's solid.\n\nLet me also compute \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) and \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\) again to make sure I didn't miscalculate. \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) is 6, because 4! is 24, 2! is 2, so 24/(2*2) = 6. And \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\) is 20, because 6! is 720, 3! is 6, so 720/(6*6) = 20. Yep, that's correct. So, 6 times 20 is 120. I think I'm confident that this is the right answer.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, maybe I can expand a small part of the expression to see if this makes sense. Let's take \\((a + b)^4\\). Expanding that, we get \\(a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6. Now, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) expands to \\(c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15\\dfrac{1}{c^2} + 6\\dfrac{1}{c^4} + \\dfrac{1}{c^6}\\). So, the constant term is 20. Therefore, when we multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which doesn't involve \\(c\\), we only take the constant term from the second expansion, which is 20, and multiply it by 6. So, 6 * 20 = 120. That makes sense.\n\nWait, another way to think about it: when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term is the sum of the products of the coefficients of terms whose exponents add up to that term. But in this case, since the second polynomial doesn't have any \\(a\\) or \\(b\\) terms, the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) is to take \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first polynomial and multiply it by the constant term from the second polynomial. So, that's exactly what we're doing. Therefore, the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120. I think that's solid.\n\nLet me try to write this out more formally. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). The coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is \\(6 * 20 = 120\\).\n\nWait, just to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the exponents when expanding \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, when does \\(6 - 2m = 0\\)? That's when \\(m = 3\\). So, the term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} c^0 = 20\\). That's correct. So, the constant term is indeed 20.\n\nI think I've covered all the bases here. So, the final answer should be 120. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning, so I'm confident that's correct.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break down the problem into two parts: finding the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and finding the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\n1. **Finding the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\):**\n\n   Using the binomial theorem, we know that:\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\), so the coefficient is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\n   \\]\n\n2. **Finding the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n\n   Using the binomial theorem, we expand:\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n   \\]\n   We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, which occurs when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\).

I already found that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. Now, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me think about how to approach this. Again, using the binomial theorem, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying the exponents: \\(c^{6 - m} \\times c^{-m} = c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, each term in the expansion is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We want the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, because that's \\(c^0\\). So, we set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Let me calculate that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Now, putting it all together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes here. So, first, I found the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) as 6, which seems right because \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Then, for \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), I needed the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, which occurs when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Then, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying these together gives 6 * 20 = 120. Hmm, that seems correct. Wait, but let me check if I considered all the terms correctly. When I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) would only multiply the constant term in the other expansion to give a term without \\(c\\). Any other term would involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), so the product would have a \\(c\\) term, which isn't what we want. So, only the constant term in the second expansion contributes to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. Therefore, the coefficient is indeed 6 * 20 = 120. So, I think that's the answer. Let me just go through it again to make sure I didn't miss anything. First part: \\((a + b)^4\\). Coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Second part: \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiply them: 6 * 20 = 120. Yep, that seems right. I don't think I made any mistakes here. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is found using the binomial coefficient \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). For the term \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the constant term (where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0) is given by \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying these together gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\boxed{120}."
