Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Now, since the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial is multiplied by the term \\(c^0\\) in the second polynomial, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the two coefficients: 6 * 20 = 120. Wait, but let me double-check that. So, when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part will only contribute to the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the product when it's multiplied by the term in the second part that has \\(c^0\\), because any other term would introduce a \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\) factor, which would make the overall term have \\(c\\) dependence. So, yes, the coefficient is indeed 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't miss anything. Is there a possibility that other terms in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) could contribute to the \\(a^2b^2\\) term when multiplied by other terms in \\((a + b)^4\\)? For example, if I have a term like \\(a^3b\\) from the first polynomial and a term like \\(c^{-1}\\) from the second, would that somehow combine to give an \\(a^2b^2\\) term? No, because when you multiply \\(a^3b\\) by \\(c^{-1}\\), you still have \\(a^3b c^{-1}\\), which isn't \\(a^2b^2\\). Similarly, other combinations would introduce \\(c\\) terms, so they don't affect the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. So, only the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first polynomial multiplied by the constant term \\(c^0\\) from the second polynomial contributes to the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the product. Therefore, my calculation of 120 seems correct.\n\nWait, but just to be thorough, let me think about the entire expansion. The product is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, when you expand this, every term will be of the form \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}a^{4 - k}b^k \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) occurs when \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\), as I had before, and \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), so \\(m = 3\\). So, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} \\times \\dbinom{6}{3} = 6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Yeah, that seems right.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of the entire expression as a product of two independent expansions, so the coefficients multiply when the exponents match. Since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), only the constant term in the \\(c\\) part affects it. So, again, 6 * 20 = 120. I think that's solid.\n\nWait, another way to check: perhaps I can compute the entire product up to the \\(a^2b^2\\) term, but that might be time-consuming. Alternatively, I can use generating functions. The generating function for \\((a + b)^4\\) is straightforward, and the generating function for \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is as well. When multiplied together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed the product of the coefficients from each generating function for their respective parts. So, I think 120 is correct.\n\nWait, but let me just compute \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) again: 4!/(2!2!) = (24)/(2*2) = 6. Correct. And \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\) is 20, as 6!/(3!3!) = 720/(6*6) = 720/36 = 20. So, 6*20 is 120. Yep, that's correct.\n\nI think I'm confident that the coefficient is 120. So, the answer should be 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem for both parts of the expression.\n\n1. **Expanding \\((a + b)^4\\):**\n   Using the binomial theorem, we have:\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\), so the coefficient is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\n   \\]\n\n2. **Expanding \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   Using the binomial theorem, we have:\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n   \\]\n   We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, which occurs when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\).

Since these are being multiplied together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by the constant term from the second part, which is 20. So, 6 * 20 is indeed 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120. I think that makes sense. Let me just recap to make sure I didn't miss anything. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product of two expressions. The first expression is \\((a + b)^4\\), and the second is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is by taking the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first expression and multiplying it by the constant term (with respect to \\(c\\)) from the second expression. So, I correctly found the coefficients from each part and multiplied them together to get the final coefficient. I don't think I made any mistakes in my calculations. The binomial coefficients for 4 choose 2 and 6 choose 3 are both correct, and their product is indeed 120. So, I'm confident that the answer is 120.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break the problem into two parts:\n\n1. **Find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\):**\n   Using the binomial theorem:\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term with \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\):\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\n   \\]\n   \n2. **Find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   Using the binomial theorem:\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n   \\]\n   The term with \\(c^0\\) occurs when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), so \\(m = 3\\):\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\n   \\]\n   \n3. **Multiply the coefficients:**\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(6\\) and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(20\\).

Again, using the binomial theorem, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying that, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m} = \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the exponent of \\(c\\) in each term is \\(6 - 2m\\). We need the exponent to be 0, so we set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Let me compute that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the two coefficients I found: 6 (from \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\)) multiplied by 20 (from \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\)). So, 6 * 20 = 120. Wait, let me double-check that. So, \\((a + b)^4\\) gives a coefficient of 6 for \\(a^2b^2\\), and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) gives a coefficient of 20 for \\(c^0\\). So, when I multiply these two expressions together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by 20, so the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120. That seems correct. I don't think I made any mistakes here. Let me just recap: To find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, I first found the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then I found the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 20. Multiplying these together gives 120. So, the coefficient is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is found by considering the product of the relevant terms from each binomial expansion. \n\n1. Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n2. Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n3.

Let me think about how to expand that. Again, I can use the binomial theorem here. \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m} = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). I need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so I set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\) so \\(m = 3\\).

Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the second part), which is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). So, the coefficient is 120. Wait, let me just check that again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. So, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. In \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. So, when you multiply the two polynomials, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, the only contribution comes from the term where the second polynomial contributes a constant (i.e., \\(c^0\\)), so that the product doesn't have any \\(c\\) terms. So, yes, that would be 6 times 20, which is 120. I think that's correct.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.
