Let me just think about it another way to confirm. If I were to expand \\((a + b)^4\\), I get terms like \\(a^4\\), \\(4a^3b\\), \\(6a^2b^2\\), \\(4ab^3\\), and \\(b^4\\). So, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term is 6, as I found. Then, in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the constant term is 20, as I found. So, when I multiply these two expansions, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) from the first part will multiply the constant term 20 from the second part, giving \\(6 * 20 a^2b^2 = 120a^2b^2\\). Any other term from the second polynomial would introduce a power of \\(c\\), so they don't affect the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. So, yes, 120 is the correct coefficient.

Wait, but hold on a second. Let me make sure that I'm not missing anything else. The problem is asking for the coefficient in the product of two expressions.

    "text": " / (3! * 3!) = (720) / (6 * 6) = 720 / 36 = 20. That's correct too. So, 6 * 20 is indeed 120. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120. Wait, but hold on a second. Let me make sure I didn't overlook anything. The problem is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). When expanding, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\), and it's multiplied by the term \\(c^0\\) from the second expansion, which is 20. So, the product term is \\(a^2b^2 \\times 20\\), but wait, no, actually, the second expansion's term is just a scalar coefficient, right? Because when you multiply polynomials, each term is a scalar multiplied by variables. So, the term from the second expansion is just 20, so when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by 20, you get \\(20a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient is 20 multiplied by 6, which is 120. Wait, no, actually, I think I might have confused myself here. Let me clarify: the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), when expanded, is a sum of terms like \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}a^{4 - k}b^k\\). The second part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), when expanded, is a sum of terms like \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, when you multiply these two expansions together, each term from the first is multiplied by each term from the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\(k=2\\) in the first expansion, which is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\\). Now, this term is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) times each term in the second expansion will give terms like \\(6a^2b^2 \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will only appear when multiplied by the term where \\(c^{6 - 2m}\\) is \\(c^0\\), which is when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), so \\(m=3\\), as I found earlier. Therefore, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is \\(6 \\times \\dbinom{6}{3} = 6 \\times 20 = 120\\). So, that seems correct. I don't think I made any mistakes here.

Wait, but just to be thorough, let me consider the entire expansion again. So, the expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). When we expand this, each term from \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\) with coefficient 6, and it's multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But we only want the terms where the product doesn't have any \\(c\\) terms, meaning the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. So, as I found earlier, the only term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) with \\(c^0\\) is the term when \\(m=3\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} c^{0}\\), which is 20. So, yes, multiplying 6 by 20 gives 120. Therefore, the coefficient is 120. I think that's correct. I don't see any mistakes in the reasoning. So, the final answer should be 120.\n\nWait, hold on a second. Let me just think again. So, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product. So, is there a possibility that there are other terms in the expansion where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by a term that's not just a constant, but maybe a higher power of \\(c\\), but when multiplied together, the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out? But no, because \\(a^2b^2\\) is only from the first part, and the second part is in terms of \\(c\\). So, any term from the second part would have a \\(c\\) exponent, so when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by any term from the second part, you'd get a term like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2c^{-k}\\), but not \\(a^2b^2\\) alone. Therefore, the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms is to multiply by the constant term from the second polynomial, which is 20. So, yeah, 6 times 20 is 120. I think that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of it as treating the entire expression as a product of two polynomials and looking for the specific term. So, \\((a + b)^4\\) gives terms with \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) gives terms with \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, when you multiply them, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) can only come from the product of \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first polynomial and the term that is \\(c^0\\) from the second polynomial. Because any other term from the second polynomial would have a \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), which would result in a term like \\(a^2b^2c\\) or \\(a^2b^2/c\\), which are not \\(a^2b^2\\) alone. So, that confirms that the coefficient is indeed 6 * 20 = 120. So, I think I've double-checked it enough times.
