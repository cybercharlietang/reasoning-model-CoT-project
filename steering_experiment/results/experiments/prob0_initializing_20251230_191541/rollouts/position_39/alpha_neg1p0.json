Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake here. Because sometimes when you have multiple variables, you might have to consider more terms, but in this case, since we're only looking for \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), the only way to get that term is by multiplying \\(a^2b^2\\) with the constant term in the second polynomial. So, yes, I think that's correct. Alternatively, another way to think about it is that the entire expression is the product of two expansions, and when you multiply them, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will only come from the product of the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first expansion and the constant term in the second expansion. So, the coefficients multiply. Therefore, the coefficient is indeed 6 * 20 = 120. Let me just double-check my calculations. \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\) is correct because 4 choose 2 is 6. \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\) is also correct because 6 choose 3 is 20. So, 6 * 20 is 120.
