Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is 120. Wait, let me double-check my reasoning. I considered that the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from multiplying the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first part by the constant term in the second part. But is that the only way? Let me think. If I were to consider the entire expansion, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term would indeed be multiplied by all terms in the second polynomial. But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), but wait, no, actually, the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so perhaps it's considering the term \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. But in reality, when you multiply out the entire expression, each term in the product will have both \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) parts and \\(c\\) parts. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by every term in the second polynomial, but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) part, we might have to sum over all possible \\(c\\) terms. Wait, no, that doesn't make sense. Because \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term in the product, but each term in the product is a combination of \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) terms. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would only be present in the product if it's multiplied by a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), because otherwise, the term would have \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\) in it. So, actually, the only way to get a term with \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) is by multiplying the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first polynomial by the constant term from the second polynomial. Therefore, the coefficient is indeed 6 * 20 = 120. Alternatively, if the problem had asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some \\(k\\), then we would have to consider different terms, but since it's just \\(a^2b^2\\), we're only looking for the term where the \\(c\\) exponent is zero. Therefore, my initial reasoning seems correct.
