    "text": " \n\nFirst, I remember that when you have an expression like \\((x + y)^n\\), you can expand it using the binomial theorem. The binomial theorem says that each term in the expansion is of the form \\(\\dbinom{n}{k}x^{n - k}y^{k}\\), where \\(\\dbinom{n}{k}\\) is the binomial coefficient, which can be found using combinations. So, I think I can apply this to both parts of the given expression separately.\n\nLooking at the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), I can expand this using the binomial theorem. The general term in this expansion would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}a^{4 - k}b^{k}\\), where \\(k\\) ranges from 0 to 4. Since I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I need to find the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2 each. That means \\(4 - k = 2\\) for \\(a\\), so \\(k = 2\\). Therefore, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\).\n\nLet me calculate that. \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) is equal to \\(\\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient from the first part is 6.\n\nNow, moving on to the second part, which is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I need to expand this as well. Using the binomial theorem again, each term will be \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - m}\\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\), where \\(m\\) ranges from 0 to 6. Simplifying that, each term becomes \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - m}c^{-m} = \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\).\n\nWait, but I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\). Hmm, does that mean I don't need to consider the second part at all? Or maybe I need to find the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero because \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't have any \\(c\\) terms. So, if I set the exponent \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), then \\(6 = 2m\\), so \\(m = 3\\). \n\nTherefore, the coefficient from the second part where \\(c\\) cancels out (i.e., \\(c^0\\)) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). \n\nWait, that doesn't seem right. Let me check that again. 6! is 720, and 3! is 6, so 720 divided by (6 \u00d7 6) is 720/36, which is indeed 20. So, the coefficient from the second part is 20.\n\nNow, since the original expression is the product of \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the overall coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) (which is only present in the first part) multiplied by the constant term from the second part (since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\)) would be the product of the two coefficients I found. So, that's 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the second part).\n\nCalculating that, 6 \u00d7 20 = 120. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake here. I considered that the second part contributes a constant term, which is 20, and the first part contributes 6 for \\(a^2b^2\\), so when multiplied together, it's 120. That seems correct because when you multiply two expressions, the coefficients multiply as well.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should think about it as the entire expression being the product of two expansions. So, any term in the product would be a term from the first expansion multiplied by a term from the second expansion. Since I'm interested in \\(a^2b^2\\), which comes from the first expansion, the corresponding term from the second expansion must be the constant term, because if I take any power of \\(c\\) from the second expansion, it would affect the term, but since I don't want any \\(c\\) terms, it has to be \\(c^0\\), which is 1, and its coefficient is 20.\n\nSo, yes, multiplying 6 by 20 gives 120. Therefore, the coefficient is 120.\n\nI think that's correct. Let me just recap to make sure I didn't miss anything. The problem asks for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I expanded each part separately using the binomial theorem, found the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part (which is 6) and the constant term in the second part (which is 20). Then, since these two terms multiply together in the overall product, their coefficients multiply, giving 120. \n\nI don't see any mistakes in the calculations. The binomial coefficients were calculated correctly, and the exponents were handled properly. So, I feel confident that the coefficient is indeed 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is found using the binomial coefficient \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). For the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the constant term (where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero) occurs at \\(m = 3\\), giving the coefficient \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying these coefficients together gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\boxed{120}"

    "text": " I'm a bit confused, but I'll take it slow.\n\nFirst, I think I should expand each part separately and then see how they combine. The expression has two parts: \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I need the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which means I probably only need to look at the part involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), right? Because \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) are in the other part, and since they're multiplied together, maybe the terms with \\(c\\) won't affect the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. Let me check that.\n\nWait, actually, when you multiply two expressions, each term from the first expression gets multiplied by each term from the second. So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I need to find all the terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any term from the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), maybe the coefficient would just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, no, that doesn't seem right because when you multiply, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), so the \\(a^2b^2\\) term would only come from the product where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by the constant term (if any) in the second expansion. But wait, does \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) have a constant term?\n\nLet me think. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) will have terms where the exponents of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) add up to 6. So, each term is of the form \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, the exponent of \\(c\\) in each term is \\(6 - 2k\\). For the term to be a constant (i.e., \\(c^0\\)), we need \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\). So, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\), which is 20. So, the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) has a constant term of 20, and other terms with positive or negative exponents of \\(c\\).\n\nTherefore, when we multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), we need to consider only the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by the constant term (20) from the second expansion. Because if it's multiplied by any other term with \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), the resulting term would have \\(c\\) in it, so it wouldn't just be \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by 20.\n\nWait, let me make sure I'm thinking correctly. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\), right? Because in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\), the general term is \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\\). So, when \\(k = 2\\), we get \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} a^{2}b^{2}\\), which is 6 times \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient is 6.\n\nThen, when we multiply this by the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) gets multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But since we only want the term where the result is \\(a^2b^2\\) times something that doesn't involve \\(c\\), we only take the constant term from the second expansion, which is 20, as I found earlier.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nWait, but hold on a second. Let me think again. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, actually, when we multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second part, including the constant term, which is 20. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times 20, which is 120.\n\nBut wait, could there be other terms in the second expansion that, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), result in \\(a^2b^2\\) times some power of \\(c\\), but perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\)? Hmm, that's a good point. Let me check the problem again.\n\nThe problem says: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)\". So, it's just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, in that case, every term in the expansion where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any term from the second expansion would contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, but that's not correct because each term in the product will be of the form \\(a^kb^{4 - k} \\times c^{m}\\) or something like that. So, the only way to get a term with \\(a^2b^2\\) is when \\(k = 2\\) in the first expansion, and then multiplied by any term in the second expansion. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a monomial without any \\(c\\) terms. So, perhaps I was wrong earlier, and we only need to consider the constant term in the second expansion because otherwise, the term would have \\(c\\) in it, making it not just \\(a^2b^2\\).\n\nWait, but the problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", which would imply that the term is \\(a^2b^2\\) times some power of \\(c\\), but in reality, the term would be \\(a^2b^2\\) times a combination of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the constant term in \\(c\\). Hmm, that makes more sense. So, I think I was correct the first time. So, the coefficient would be 6 times 20, which is 120.\n\nWait, but let me confirm this. Let's consider that the product is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when we expand this, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would mean that we are looking for all terms where the product results in \\(a^2b^2\\) times any power of \\(c\\). But since the problem is written as \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", without any mention of \\(c\\), I think it's implying that we're looking for the coefficient when the entire expression is considered as a polynomial in \\(a, b, c, 1/c\\), and we're interested in the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) appears, regardless of the \\(c\\) part. But that seems a bit ambiguous.\n\nWait, perhaps another way to think about it is that the problem is treating \\(a, b, c\\) as separate variables, and the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is a monomial in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the coefficient would include any factors from \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\). But that doesn't make much sense because the term would have both \\(a^2b^2\\) and some power of \\(c\\). So, maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), meaning the constant term in \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 6 times 20, which is 120.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. But that would mean that every term in the product where \\(a^2b^2\\) appears, regardless of the \\(c\\) part, contributes to the coefficient. But that's not how coefficients work because each term is unique. So, I think the intended interpretation is that we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by the constant term in \\(c\\). So, that would be 6 times 20, which is 120.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Suppose we expand the entire product, then each term would be of the form \\(a^kb^{4 - k} c^{m}\\) where \\(k\\) is from 0 to 4 and \\(m\\) is from some negative to positive number. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would appear multiplied by \\(c^m\\) for various \\(m\\). But the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would be the sum of all coefficients where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present, regardless of the \\(c\\) part. Wait, no, that can't be, because each term is unique. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion, which doesn't make sense because coefficients are scalars, not polynomials.\n\nWait, so perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), that is, the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by the constant term in \\(c\\). So, that would make sense, and the coefficient would be 6 times 20, which is 120.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is written such that it's considering the product as a polynomial in \\(a, b, c\\), and the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is present in each term of the product where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by some power of \\(c\\). But in that case, the coefficient would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion, which would be \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). But that doesn't seem right because that would make the coefficient 6 times 64, which is 384, but that's probably not the case.\n\nWait, no, that approach is incorrect because each term in the product is a combination of terms from both expansions. So, the correct way is to consider that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. But that would be 6 times 64, which is 384. But that can't be right because that would mean the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is present in the product with a coefficient of 384, which is not the case because each term in the product is a combination of \\(a, b\\) and \\(c\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times any \\(c\\) term is part of the product, but the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is ambiguous.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is intended to be interpreted as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), meaning that we need to sum over all possible \\(c\\) terms. So, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 times \\(2^6 = 64\\), so 6 times 64 is 384. But that seems high, and I'm not sure if that's the intended interpretation.\n\nWait, but let's go back to the problem statement: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)\". The way it's phrased, it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which in the product would be the sum of all coefficients where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any term from the second expansion. So, that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 times \\(2^6 = 64\\), so 384. But that seems too large, and I'm not sure if that's correct.\n\nWait, but let me think differently. When you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum of the products of the coefficients of terms in the first polynomial that combine to form that term. So, in this case, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product can only come from the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by any term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, each of those contributes to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of the \\(c\\) part.\n\nWait, but that doesn't make sense because each term in the product is a combination of \\(a, b, c\\), so the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would actually be the sum of all coefficients of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for any \\(k\\). But that's not the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. Because the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) is 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^k\\) in the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion.\n\nWait, but the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), so \\(\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times 64, which is 384.\n\nBut that seems high, and I'm not sure if that's the intended interpretation. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be 6 times 20, which is 120. So, which is it?\n\nWait, let me think about how the problem is phrased. It says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", without mentioning \\(c\\). So, in the context of polynomials, when you have multiple variables, the coefficient of a specific term is the scalar coefficient, and the variables are part of the term. So, if you're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), that would mean the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any power of \\(c\\). But in reality, each term in the product is a combination, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the sum of all coefficients where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^k\\) for any \\(k\\). So, that would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 times 64, which is 384.\n\nWait, but that doesn't seem right because each term in the product is a monomial in \\(a, b, c\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the sum of all coefficients of terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present, regardless of \\(c\\). So, that would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 times 64, which is 384.\n\nBut let me check with a simpler example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^1 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). So, expanding this, we get \\(ac + a/c + bc + b/c\\). Now, the coefficient of \\(a\\) in this product would be \\(c + 1/c\\), because \\(a\\) is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a\\) is \\(c + 1/c\\), which is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But if the problem had asked for the coefficient of \\(a\\), it would be \\(c + 1/c\\). But if the problem had asked for the coefficient of \\(a\\) times \\(c^0\\), that would be 1, because the constant term in \\(c\\) is 1, so the coefficient would be 1.\n\nSo, in the original problem, if the question is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without any restriction on \\(c\\), then it's the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion. So, that would be 6 times 64, which is 384.\n\nBut wait, in the simpler example, the coefficient of \\(a\\) is \\(c + 1/c\\), which is a polynomial, not a scalar. But in the original problem, the answer is expected to be a scalar, as the user instruction says to put the final answer in a box, implying a numerical value. So, perhaps the intended interpretation is that we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), that is, the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by the constant term in \\(c\\). So, that would be 6 times 20, which is 120.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, considering all possible powers of \\(c\\), but that would result in a polynomial, which doesn't make sense because the coefficient should be a scalar. Therefore, the correct interpretation is that we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nWait, but let me confirm this by considering the entire product. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) from \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, each term in the product would be \\(a^2b^2 \\times \\text{term from the second expansion}\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion. So, that would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 times 64, which is 384.\n\nBut in the simpler example, the coefficient of \\(a\\) is \\(c + 1/c\\), which is a polynomial, not a scalar. So, if the problem expects a scalar, then perhaps it's intended to look for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nWait, but in the problem statement, it's written as \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", which in the context of multiple variables, usually refers to the coefficient of the monomial \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of other variables. But in reality, each term in the product will have both \\(a, b\\) and \\(c\\) parts, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually be a polynomial in \\(c\\). Therefore, the problem might have a typo, or perhaps it's intended to ask for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the entire product as a polynomial in \\(a, b, c\\), and the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is part of the product regardless of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient would be the sum over all terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present, multiplied by the corresponding coefficients from the second expansion. So, that would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 times 64, which is 384.\n\nBut since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and not \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), I'm a bit confused. However, given that the problem is likely intended to ask for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times the constant term in \\(c\\), the answer would be 120.\n\nWait, let me try another approach. Let's compute the product:\n\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\n\\]\nand\n\\[\n\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15\\dfrac{1}{c^2} + 6\\dfrac{1}{c^4} + \\dfrac{1}{c^6}\n\\]\n\nNow, when we multiply these two, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 times 64, which is 384.\n\nBut wait, if we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then yes, it's 384. But if we're only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it's 6 times 20, which is 120.\n\nI think the confusion comes from the problem's wording. Since it's written as \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", without any mention of \\(c\\), it's ambiguous. However, in the context of multiple variables, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would typically be considered as the sum over all terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present, regardless of other variables. So, that would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 times 64, which is 384.\n\nBut let me check with the original problem again. It says: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)\". So, perhaps the problem is indeed asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times any power of \\(c\\), which would be 384.\n\nBut that seems counterintuitive because when you multiply by the entire second expansion, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, leading to terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), etc., each with their own coefficients. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by 6, which is 6 times 64, which is 384.\n\nWait, but that doesn't make sense because the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is actually a polynomial in \\(c\\), not a scalar. So, perhaps the problem is misworded, and it's intended to ask for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is in the context of considering \\(c\\) as a separate variable, and the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is part of the product regardless of \\(c\\). But in that case, the coefficient would be a polynomial, which is not what is being asked.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when the entire product is considered as a polynomial in \\(a, b, c\\), but that would still result in a coefficient that's a polynomial in \\(c\\). Therefore, the only way to have a scalar coefficient is if we're considering the term \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nI think I've spent enough time thinking through this, and I'm more confident now that the intended answer is 120, considering the constant term in \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\) is 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break down the problem into two parts: expanding \\((a + b)^4\\) and considering the constant term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\n1. **Expanding \\((a + b)^4\\):**\n   The general term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is given by:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   For \\(k = 2\\), the term is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\n   \\]\n   Thus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\n2. **Considering the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   The expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) will have terms of the form \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\).

    "text": " \n\nFirst off, the expression is a product of two binomial expansions. So, I think I can handle each part separately and then multiply the results. Let me start by expanding each binomial separately.\n\nStarting with \\((a + b)^4\\). I remember the binomial theorem, which says that \\((x + y)^n = \\sum_{k=0}^{n} \\dbinom{n}{k} x^{n - k} y^k\\). So, applying that here, each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) will be \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k} b^k\\) for \\(k = 0\\) to \\(4\\).\n\nI'm specifically looking for the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2, so that would be \\(a^2b^2\\). Let me find the coefficient for this term. \n\nIn the binomial expansion, the exponent of \\(a\\) is \\(4 - k\\), and the exponent of \\(b\\) is \\(k\\). So, if I set \\(4 - k = 2\\), then \\(k = 2\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\).\n\nCalculating that, \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\nAlright, so far so good. Now, moving on to the second part: \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Again, I can use the binomial theorem here. Each term in this expansion will be \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\) for \\(m = 0\\) to \\(6\\).\n\nSimplifying that term, \\(\\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = c^{-m}\\), so the term becomes \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m} = \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\).\n\nHmm, but wait, the original problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Since the second part is in terms of \\(c\\), which is a different variable, does this affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)?\n\nLet me think. When I multiply the two expressions together, \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the variables are independent. So, each term in the first expansion will multiply each term in the second expansion. But since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are different variables, the product will have terms like \\(a^{4 - k}b^{k}c^{6 - 2m}\\).\n\nBut I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, I need to find the terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) appears, regardless of the power of \\(c\\). However, since the problem doesn't specify any particular power of \\(c\\), just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I think it means that I should consider all possible terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any power of \\(c\\), and sum their coefficients.\n\nWait, but actually, no. Because in the product, each term from the first expansion is multiplied by each term from the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all coefficients from the second part, because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by any term in the second expansion, it will still have \\(a^2b^2\\) as part of it, just multiplied by some power of \\(c\\).\n\nBut wait, no, that's not quite right. Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by a term like \\(c^{6 - 2m}\\), the resulting term is \\(a^2b^2c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, unless we're looking for a specific power of \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) across all powers of \\(c\\) would just be the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all coefficients from the second part.\n\nBut hold on, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), without specifying any particular power of \\(c\\). That suggests that we're considering all possible terms where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2, regardless of the exponent of \\(c\\). So, in effect, we're looking for the sum of all coefficients in the expansion where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present, which would be 6 (from the first part) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part.\n\nBut wait, the sum of all coefficients in the second part \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) can be found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion is 64.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nBut wait, let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. Because in the problem, the variables are separate, so each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second. But when we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), we're effectively summing over all possible exponents of \\(c\\), so the coefficient would indeed be 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me approach it differently. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, when we expand this, each term is of the form \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}a^{4 - k}b^k \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\).\n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the sum over all \\(m\\) of \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}\\). Since \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) is 6, as we found earlier, and \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\) for \\(m = 0\\) to \\(6\\) sums up to \\(2^6 = 64\\), then the total coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but that seems correct. Alternatively, if the problem had asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), then we would have needed to specify \\(k\\), but since it's just \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\), it's the sum over all \\(m\\) of the coefficients, which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should think of it as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which would indeed be 6 times 64, giving 384.\n\nWait, but let me check: if I have two polynomials, say P(a, b) and Q(c), then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in their product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in P(a, b) times the sum of all coefficients in Q(c). Because when you multiply each term in P by each term in Q, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) will be the same as in P, multiplied by each coefficient in Q, and then summed over all terms in Q.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So, in this case, the sum of coefficients in Q(c) is indeed 64, so the total coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me compute the sum of coefficients in Q(c). The sum of coefficients in a polynomial is found by substituting 1 for all variables. So, substituting c = 1, we get (1 + 1/1)^6 = 2^6 = 64. So, that's correct.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Is there another way to approach this problem? Maybe by considering the entire expansion and looking for the specific term.\n\nWait, alternatively, perhaps I can consider that the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, when we expand this, each term is \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}a^{4 - k}b^k \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\).\n\nSo, to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), we set \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\), so that's fixed. Then, for each \\(m\\) from 0 to 6, we have a term with \\(a^2b^2c^{6 - 2m}\\). The coefficient for each such term is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}\\).\n\nTherefore, the total coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) across all possible exponents of \\(c\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} \\times \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m}\\).\n\nWe know that \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} = 2^6 = 64\\), so the total coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384, as before.\n\nWait, but perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, which would include all possible powers of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient is indeed 384.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem had asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some specific \\(k\\), then we would need to find the corresponding \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\) where \\(6 - 2m = k\\). But since it's just \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\), the coefficient is the sum over all \\(m\\) of the coefficients, which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me check if I'm interpreting the problem correctly. The problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", without any mention of \\(c\\). So, in the context of the entire expression, which includes \\(c\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by any power of \\(c\\), so the coefficient is the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion times the coefficient from the first.\n\nTherefore, 6 * 64 = 384 is correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should compute the product of the two expansions and see what the coefficient is.\n\nWait, but that might be tedious, but let me try a different approach. Let me compute the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then realize that when multiplied by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by every term in the second part, each contributing their own coefficient.\n\nTherefore, the total coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which is 64, giving 384.\n\nWait, but let me check if that's correct. Let's take a simpler example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^{1}\\) plus \\(a^2b^2c^{-1}\\). But wait, in this case, \\((a + b)^2\\) only has \\(a^2\\), \\(2ab\\), and \\(b^2\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^2\\) is actually 0, because the highest degree is 2, and you can't have \\(a^2b^2\\) unless the exponent is 4.\n\nWait, that's a good point. Wait, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is present, but in \\((a + b)^2\\), it's not. So, in my initial problem, since it's \\((a + b)^4\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is present, and when multiplied by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), it's multiplied by all possible terms in that expansion.\n\nWait, but in my earlier example, if I have \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\), then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be zero because there's no \\(a^2b^2\\) term in \\((a + b)^2\\). But in my problem, \\((a + b)^4\\) does have an \\(a^2b^2\\) term, so the coefficient is non-zero.\n\nWait, but perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Let me get back to the problem.\n\nSo, to recap, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) has terms with various powers of \\(c\\), and the sum of all coefficients in that expansion is 64. Therefore, when I multiply the two expansions, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) (regardless of the power of \\(c\\)) is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem had asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some specific \\(k\\), then I would have to find the corresponding term in the second expansion. But since it's just \\(a^2b^2\\), I think the correct approach is to consider all possible powers of \\(c\\), hence the sum of coefficients.\n\nWait, but let me think again. When the problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", does it mean the coefficient when considering all variables, including \\(c\\), or just in the context of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\)? Because in the product, each term includes both \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) and \\(c\\). So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then it's 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, if I'm supposed to consider only the terms where \\(c\\) is raised to a specific power, but the problem doesn't specify, so I think the former is correct.\n\nWait, but perhaps I should think of it as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times any power of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient would be the same as in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me check with another approach. Let me compute the product:\n\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\n\\]\n\\[\n\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15c^{-2} + 6c^{-4} + c^{-6}\n\\]\n\nSo, when I multiply these two, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial, which is 6, multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. So, each term in the second polynomial has a coefficient, and when multiplied by 6, gives the contribution to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^{6 - 2m}\\).\n\nTherefore, the total coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) across all powers of \\(c\\) is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me compute the sum of coefficients in the second polynomial explicitly. The second polynomial is:\n\n\\[\n\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15c^{-2} + 6c^{-4} + c^{-6}\n\\]\n\nThe coefficients are 1, 6, 15, 20, 15, 6, 1. Adding them up: 1 + 6 = 7, 7 + 15 = 22, 22 + 20 = 42, 42 + 15 = 57, 57 + 6 = 63, 63 + 1 = 64. So, yes, the sum of coefficients is 64.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me think of it another way. If I have two polynomials, P and Q, then the coefficient of a specific term in P times the sum of all terms in Q would give me the coefficient of that term across all terms in Q.\n\nYes, that's correct. So, in this case, P is \\((a + b)^4\\) and Q is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in P is 6, and the sum of all coefficients in Q is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product P*Q is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nI think that makes sense. So, after all that, I'm confident that the coefficient is 384.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{384}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break down the problem into two parts and use the binomial theorem.\n\n1. **Expanding \\((a + b)^4\\):**\n   Using the binomial theorem, the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is given by:\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k} b^k\n   \\]\n   We are interested in the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2, which is \\(a^2b^2\\).

    "text": " I'm a bit rusty on my combinatorics, but I'll give it a shot.\n\nFirst, I remember that when expanding expressions like \\((a + b)^n\\), we can use the binomial theorem. The binomial theorem states that \\((a + b)^n = \\sum_{k=0}^{n} \\dbinom{n}{k} a^{n - k} b^k\\). So, for \\((a + b)^4\\), each term will be of the form \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k} b^k\\).\n\nSince I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I can set up the equation \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). Solving for \\(k\\), I get \\(k = 2\\). So, the coefficient from the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), should be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\).\n\nCalculating that, \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\nNow, moving on to the second part: \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I also need to expand this using the binomial theorem. The general term here will be \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\), which simplifies to \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\).\n\nWait a second, but I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\). So, does that mean I can treat the two parts separately? That is, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part? Or do I need to consider some interaction between them?\n\nI think I need to consider that the entire expression is the product of two expansions: \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when I multiply them together, each term in the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion.\n\nBut wait, the problem only asks for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). That means I only need to consider the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part and multiply it by all terms from the second part, right? Because when you multiply, the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) won't be affected by the \\(c\\) terms. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression will just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part.\n\nWait, that doesn't seem right. Because if I multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by something involving \\(c\\), then the resulting term would have \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or something like that. But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, actually, maybe I don't need to worry about the \\(c\\) terms because they don't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) exponents.\n\nWait, no, that's not quite correct. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but the entire expression includes terms with \\(c\\). However, when you multiply two polynomials, the exponents add. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part will be multiplied by every term in the second part, each of which has some power of \\(c\\). But since the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) exponents, I think that means we're looking for all terms where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2 and 2, respectively, regardless of what happens with \\(c\\).\n\nWait, but that would mean that the coefficient is just the product of the coefficient from the first part and the entire second expansion. But that can't be, because the second expansion has multiple terms, each contributing different powers of \\(c\\). So, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), treating \\(c\\) as another variable, but since \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) are present, maybe the problem is only concerned with the terms where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2 and 2, and the exponents of \\(c\\) can be anything. But in that case, the coefficient would be the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients from the second part.\n\nWait, no, because each term in the second expansion has a coefficient and a power of \\(c\\). So, when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, you get terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) with coefficients. But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would be the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion, because each term in the second expansion, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), would contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), but if we're only interested in \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), then the coefficient would be the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion times the coefficient from the first part.\n\nWait, but that seems a bit off. Let me think again. The problem is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, when you expand this, each term will be of the form \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}a^{4 - k}b^k \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - m}(1/c)^m\\), which simplifies to \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}\\dbinom{6}{m}a^{4 - k}b^k c^{6 - 2m}\\).\n\nSo, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) occurs when \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\), as we determined earlier. So, the coefficient from the first part is 6. Now, for the second part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\), so the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\) and the exponent is \\(6 - 2m\\).\n\nBut in the product, each term from the first expansion is multiplied by each term from the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by every term in the second expansion, each contributing a different power of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product will be the coefficient from the first part, 6, multiplied by the sum of all coefficients from the second part.\n\nWait, but the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of all coefficients is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 \u00d7 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but that seems too straightforward. Let me check that again. Alternatively, maybe I'm supposed to consider that the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is only multiplied by the constant term in the second expansion, i.e., the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. Because if I'm only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then I might be missing something.\n\nWait, no, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but since the entire expression is a product, any term that has \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by any power of \\(c\\) would still be a term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present. But if the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), perhaps it's considering all possible powers of \\(c\\), so the coefficient would indeed be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 \u00d7 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but I'm not entirely sure. Let me approach it another way. Let's consider that when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum of the products of the coefficients of terms that multiply together to give that specific term. So, in this case, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) can be formed by taking \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part and any term from the second part, because the second part doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\). So, the coefficient would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the sum of all coefficients in the second part.\n\nYes, that makes sense. Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, each of those will contribute to terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), but if the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\), then you're effectively summing over all possible \\(k\\), which is the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion.\n\nSo, the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is indeed 64, as I calculated earlier. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 \u00d7 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me double-check that. Alternatively, maybe I'm supposed to consider that the second expansion only contributes a specific term, but that doesn't make sense because the problem isn't specifying any condition on \\(c\\). So, I think my initial approach is correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to have the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), i.e., the constant term. But the problem doesn't specify that, so I think it's just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient is 6 \u00d7 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me think again. If the problem had specified a particular power of \\(c\\), say \\(c^0\\), then we would have to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would require finding the term in the second expansion where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. But since it's just \\(a^2b^2\\), perhaps the problem is considering the coefficient in the product where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present, regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, that would mean that the coefficient is indeed 6 \u00d7 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me check that another way. Let's expand both parts separately and see how the multiplication works. The first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), when expanded, will have terms from \\(a^4\\) down to \\(b^4\\). The second part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), when expanded, will have terms from \\(c^6\\) down to \\(c^{-6}\\), each with their own coefficients.\n\nWhen you multiply these two expansions together, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion will be multiplied by every term in the second expansion, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), and so on, down to \\(a^2b^2c^{-6}\\). Each of these terms will have a coefficient equal to the product of the coefficients from the first and second expansions.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) in the product will be 6 \u00d7 \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\), where \\(k = 6 - 2m\\). But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). That means we need to sum all the coefficients where the term is \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for any \\(k\\). So, that would be 6 \u00d7 (sum of all coefficients in the second expansion), which is 6 \u00d7 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me make sure that this is correct. Alternatively, maybe the problem is intended to have the term \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by the constant term in the second expansion, i.e., the term where \\(c^0\\). In that case, we would need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion and then multiply it by 6.\n\nSo, let's try that approach. The second expansion is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). The general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - m} \\times \\left(1/c\\right)^m = \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\). We want the exponent of \\(c\\) to be zero, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which gives \\(m = 3\\). So, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n\nTherefore, if we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), it would be 6 \u00d7 20 = 120. But the problem didn't specify \\(c^0\\), so I'm not sure if that's what's intended.\n\nWait, let me check the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" It doesn't mention anything about \\(c\\), so perhaps it's considering all possible terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) appears, regardless of the power of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient would be 6 \u00d7 64 = 384.\n\nBut now I'm confused because I'm getting two different answers depending on whether I consider the constant term in the second expansion or the sum of all coefficients. I need to figure out which interpretation is correct.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, considering all possible exponents of \\(c\\). That would mean that the coefficient is 6 \u00d7 (sum of all coefficients in the second expansion), which is 6 \u00d7 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem had specified a particular term, like \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then the answer would be 120. But since it's just \\(a^2b^2\\), I think the correct interpretation is that we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), so it's 384.\n\nWait, but let me think about how coefficients work in products of polynomials. When you have two polynomials multiplied together, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum of the products of the coefficients of the terms that combine to form that specific term. So, in this case, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) can be formed by taking \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first polynomial and any term from the second polynomial, because the second polynomial doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is indeed the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial.\n\nSo, to confirm, the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial is found by substituting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1/1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient is 6 \u00d7 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but I'm still a bit unsure because sometimes problems like this expect you to consider only the constant term, but I think that's only when they specify the term. Since they didn't, I think 384 is the correct answer.\n\nSo, to recap:\n\n1. Find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6.\n2. Find the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 64.\n3. Multiply them together to get 6 \u00d7 64 = 384.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 384.\n\nBut just to make sure, let me check with a small example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^1 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, the expansion would be \\((a + b)(c + 1/c)\\). The coefficient of \\(a\\) would be 1 \u00d7 (1 + 1) = 2, right? Because when you expand, you get \\(a c + a (1/c) + b c + b (1/c)\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a\\) is 2, which is indeed 1 (from the first part) times the sum of coefficients in the second part, which is 2.\n\nSimilarly, the coefficient of \\(b\\) would be 1 \u00d7 2 = 2.\n\nSo, that seems to confirm that the approach is correct. Therefore, in our original problem, the coefficient is 384.\n\nWait, but let me try another example to be absolutely sure. Let's take \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^2\\). The expansion of \\((a + b)^2\\) is \\(a^2 + 2ab + b^2\\). The expansion of \\((c + 1/c)^2\\) is \\(c^2 + 2 + 1/c^2\\). Now, the product would be:\n\n\\(a^2(c^2 + 2 + 1/c^2) + 2ab(c^2 + 2 + 1/c^2) + b^2(c^2 + 2 + 1/c^2)\\).\n\nIf I look for the coefficient of \\(a^2\\), it would be 1 \u00d7 (1 + 2 + 1) = 4. Similarly, the coefficient of \\(b^2\\) would be 1 \u00d7 (1 + 2 + 1) = 4. The coefficient of \\(ab\\) would be 2 \u00d7 (1 + 2 + 1) = 6.\n\nAlternatively, if I wanted the coefficient of \\(a^2c^0\\), it would be 1 \u00d7 2 = 2, because that's the constant term in the second expansion.\n\nSo, in this example, the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) is indeed the coefficient from the first expansion times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. Therefore, applying this to our original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 \u00d7 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but in the example, the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) is 4, which is 1 \u00d7 (1 + 2 + 1) = 4, which is correct. So, yes, the approach seems valid.\n\nTherefore, I'm confident that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is 384.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{384}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem for both parts of the expression.\n\n1. **Expanding \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   The general term is \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k} b^k\\). We need the term where \\(a^2b^2\\), which occurs when \\(k = 2\\). The coefficient is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\n   \\]\n\n2. **Considering the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   The general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). The sum of all coefficients in this expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives:\n   \\[\n   (1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\n   \\]\n\n3. **Combining the results:**\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the product of the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) and the sum of all coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient is:\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 64 = 384\n   \\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{384}\\)."

    "text": " I'm a bit confused because there are two variables, \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and another part with \\(c\\), but I think I can break it down.\n\nFirst, I remember that when you expand a binomial like \\((a + b)^n\\), you can use the binomial theorem. The binomial theorem says that \\((a + b)^n = \\sum_{k=0}^{n} \\dbinom{n}{k} a^{n - k} b^{k}\\). So, for \\((a + b)^4\\), the expansion will have terms from \\(a^4\\) down to \\(b^4\\), each multiplied by a binomial coefficient.\n\nSince the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I should focus on that specific term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\). Let me write that out. The general term in the expansion is \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k} b^{k}\\). So, when \\(k = 2\\), the term is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} a^{2} b^{2}\\). \n\nCalculating the binomial coefficient, \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) is 6, because 4! / (2! * 2!) = (24)/(2*2) = 6. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. \n\nNow, looking at the entire expression, it's multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, so the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is going to be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so I think I need to consider how the multiplication affects this term.\n\nBut hold on, actually, the question is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, maybe the part with \\(c\\) doesn't affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) because \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\). Hmm, that might make sense. So, perhaps the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just the same as in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not involving \\(c\\), maybe the coefficient is just 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) expansion?\n\nWait, no, that might not be correct. Let me think again. The entire expression is a product of two expansions. So, when you multiply them, each term from the first expansion is multiplied by each term from the second expansion. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\), perhaps the coefficient is just 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, because each term in the second expansion will multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term, contributing to the overall coefficient.\n\nWait, but that doesn't seem right either. Let me clarify. The problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. Since \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) are separate variables, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term doesn't involve \\(c\\), so when you multiply by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in that expansion will multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), etc. But the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not considering the \\(c\\) terms. So, actually, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term itself doesn't get multiplied by any \\(c\\) terms; rather, each term in the product will have both \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) parts and \\(c\\) parts. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms would require summing over all possible \\(c\\) terms multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\).\n\nWait, that might be it. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 (from the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first part) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), because each term in the second expansion will contribute a coefficient that, when multiplied by 6, will give the total coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) times each power of \\(c\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, we need to sum all those contributions.\n\nWait, but that would mean that the coefficient is 6 multiplied by the sum of the coefficients of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). The sum of the coefficients in a polynomial is found by substituting 1 for all variables. So, substituting \\(c = 1\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the sum of the coefficients is 64.\n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 * 64 = 384. Hmm, that seems plausible. Let me check if that makes sense.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, but since \\(c\\) is separate, the coefficient is just 6, because the other part doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. But that doesn't seem right because when you multiply two polynomials, each term in one is multiplied by each term in the other. So, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part, which includes various powers of \\(c\\), but the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\). So, actually, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me think again. When you have a product of two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum of the products of the coefficients of terms that multiply together to give that specific term. But in this case, we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, that would mean that for each possible term in the second polynomial, which is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), we have a term like \\(c^k\\) or \\(c^{-k}\\), and when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), it becomes \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2c^{-k}\\). But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, the coefficient would be the sum of all the coefficients from the second polynomial, because each of those coefficients, when multiplied by 6, contributes to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times each power of \\(c\\). But since we're not considering the \\(c\\) terms, we just sum all those contributions, which is 6 * sum of coefficients in the second polynomial.\n\nBut wait, no. Actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial, because each term in the second polynomial, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), will contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times each power of \\(c\\). However, since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, we have to sum all the coefficients from the second polynomial and multiply by 6. So, as I calculated before, the sum of coefficients in the second polynomial is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me think differently. Maybe the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), because otherwise, if we're considering \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), it's just 6. But I don't think that's the case because the problem specifically says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4(c + 1/c)^6\\)\", which implies that we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times any power of \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, which would include all possible powers of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\) would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me check with an example. Suppose we have \\((a + b)^1 (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, expanding, we get \\(a c + a/c + b c + b/c\\). The coefficient of \\(a b\\) would be zero because there's no \\(a b\\) term. Wait, no, that's not right because in this case, the first part is only \\((a + b)\\), so the expansion would have \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms, each multiplied by terms from the second polynomial. So, the coefficient of \\(a\\) times any term from the second polynomial is just 1 times the sum of coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 2. Similarly, the coefficient of \\(b\\) would be 1 times 2 = 2. But if we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which isn't present in \\((a + b)^1\\), it would be zero. Hmm, maybe that's a better way to think about it.\n\nWait, in our original problem, \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. Now, when we multiply by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part, which are terms like \\(c^6\\), \\(6c^4\\), \\(15c^2\\), \\(20\\), \\(15c^{-2}\\), \\(6c^{-4}\\), \\(c^{-6}\\). So, when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each of these, you get terms like \\(6a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(36a^2b^2c^4\\), etc. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, that would mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the sum of all the coefficients from the second polynomial, because each term in the second polynomial contributes its coefficient to the \\(a^2b^2\\) term when multiplied by 6.\n\nWait, but actually, when you have \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by each term in the second polynomial, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times each power of \\(c\\) is 6 times the coefficient of that power of \\(c\\) in the second polynomial. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^6\\) is 6 * 1 = 6, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^4\\) is 6 * 6 = 36, and so on. But the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), without considering the \\(c\\) terms. So, that would mean that the coefficient is the sum of all these coefficients, which is 6 * (1 + 6 + 15 + 20 + 15 + 6 + 1) = 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but that seems a bit off because in reality, when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in one polynomial is multiplied by all terms in the other polynomial, but when you're looking for the coefficient of a term that doesn't involve the other variables, you have to sum over all possible combinations. So, in this case, since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient would indeed be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Maybe the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me think again. The problem is \\((a + b)^4 (c + 1/c)^6\\). When you expand this, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, which includes various powers of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times each power of \\(c\\) is 6 times the coefficient of that power in the second expansion. But since the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), that would mean we're summing all those coefficients, which is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. The sum of coefficients in the second expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but actually, that's not correct. Because when you set \\(c = 1\\), you get the sum of the coefficients, but in the second expansion, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the sum of the coefficients is indeed 64. So, multiplying that by 6 gives 384. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 384.\n\nBut let me check this with a smaller example to make sure. Suppose we have \\((a + b)^2 (c + 1/c)^1\\). Expanding, we get \\((a^2 + 2ab + b^2)(c + 1/c)\\). The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be zero because there's no \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first expansion. Wait, that's not helpful. Let me try another example.\n\nSuppose we have \\((a + b)^1 (c + 1/c)^1\\). Expanding, we get \\(a c + a/c + b c + b/c\\). The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is zero because it's not present. Hmm, not helpful either. Maybe I need to think differently.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\). In that case, we would need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part, which is the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). The constant term is found when the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out, which happens when the number of \\(c\\) terms equals the number of \\(1/c\\) terms. In the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} (1/c)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We need \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) would be 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but the problem didn't specify \\(c^0\\), it just said \\(a^2b^2\\). So, if it's asking for \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 6 * 64 = 384. But if it's asking for \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it's 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nI think the problem is more likely asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, so the answer would be 384. But I'm not entirely sure. Let me look back at the problem statement: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 (c + 1/c)^6\\)?\" It doesn't specify any particular power of \\(c\\), so I think it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times any power of \\(c\\), which would mean summing over all coefficients from the second polynomial. Therefore, the answer is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nBut to be thorough, let me consider both interpretations. If it's asking for \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), the coefficient is 384. If it's asking for \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), the coefficient is 120. Since the problem didn't specify \\(c\\), I think it's more likely the former, 384.\n\nWait, but let me think again. In the product, each term from the first polynomial is multiplied by each term from the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), etc. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the sum of all coefficients from the second polynomial multiplied by 6. So, that's 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nYes, I think that's correct. So, the coefficient is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplying it by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 64. Therefore, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n\\boxed{384}"

    "text": " \n\nFirst, I remember that when dealing with expressions raised to a power, the binomial theorem is super useful. The binomial theorem says that \\((x + y)^n = \\sum_{k=0}^{n} \\dbinom{n}{k} x^{n - k} y^{k}\\). So, I can apply this theorem to both parts of the given expression: \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nBut wait, the problem is asking specifically for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). That term is part of the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\), right? So maybe I don't need to worry about the \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) part when looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Or do I? Hmm, let me think.\n\nActually, when you multiply two expressions together, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the coefficient from the corresponding term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but since we're only interested in the \\(a^2b^2\\) term, maybe the other part can be considered as a constant multiplier? Wait, no, because when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second, so the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems complicated. Maybe I'm overcomplicating it.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the powers of c. So, maybe I just need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and then multiply it by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), perhaps the other part doesn't affect it? Hmm, no, that doesn't make sense because the entire expression is a product, so each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, that might not be right either.\n\nLet me clarify: The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from expanding \\((a + b)^4\\), and it's multiplied by every term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Is that correct?\n\nWait, no, that's not quite accurate. Because when you multiply two polynomials, each term from the first polynomial is multiplied by each term from the second. So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), that term in the product will come from taking the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from \\((a + b)^4\\) and multiplying it by each term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would actually be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems like it would create a lot of terms with different powers of c, but the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not considering the c terms. So, perhaps the c terms can be treated separately?\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me think again. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when you multiply these two expressions together, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nWait, that makes sense because when you have a term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part, it's being multiplied by every term in the second part, so the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) times each term in the second part contributes to the overall coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. But actually, no, because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by terms involving c, you get terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for various k, but the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not considering the c terms. So, perhaps the c terms don't affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), meaning that the coefficient is just the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the coefficient from the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Hmm, that seems more plausible.\n\nWait, but the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is the term where the exponent of c is zero. So, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is the middle term. Then, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nWait, but let me check that logic. Suppose I have two expressions, P(a, b) and Q(c). Then, the product P(a, b) * Q(c) would have terms where each term in P is multiplied by each term in Q. So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), that would be the same as in P(a, b), because Q(c) is just a polynomial in c, which doesn't involve a or b. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would indeed be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in P(a, b) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in Q(c). Because each term in Q(c) is a coefficient times some power of c, and when you multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), you get \\(a^2b^2\\) times each of those terms. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in P(a, b) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in Q(c). Wait, but that can't be right because the sum of all coefficients in Q(c) would be when c=1, so substituting c=1 into Q(c) gives the sum of its coefficients.\n\nWait, but let me test this with a simple example. Suppose P(a, b) = a + b and Q(c) = c + 1/c. Then, P(a, b) * Q(c) = (a + b)(c + 1/c) = a c + a/c + b c + b/c. Now, the coefficient of a in this product is c + 1/c, right? But if I were to find the coefficient of a, it's c + 1/c, which depends on c. But if I'm just looking for the coefficient of a, ignoring c, then it's like saying the coefficient is c + 1/c, which doesn't make sense because coefficients are constants, not expressions. So, perhaps my initial approach was wrong.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but in the entire expression, which includes c terms. So, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some k, but no, it's just \\(a^2b^2\\). Hmm, but in the product, \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by various powers of c, so the term \\(a^2b^2\\) itself would have a coefficient that is a polynomial in c. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would actually be a polynomial in c. So, perhaps the problem is phrased incorrectly, or maybe I'm misinterpreting it.\n\nWait, let me read the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, perhaps the problem is indeed asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), treating c as another variable, but that would mean that the coefficient would be a polynomial in c. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of c, so the coefficient would be the sum over all terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by some power of c, and the coefficient would be the sum of the coefficients from each of those terms.\n\nWait, no, that's not standard. Typically, when you're asked for the coefficient of a specific term in a product of polynomials, you're considering the term with that exact combination of variables and exponents. So, in this case, \\(a^2b^2\\) would have to be multiplied by a specific power of c to form a term like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), and the coefficient would be the coefficient of that specific term. But the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), without specifying any power of c, which is confusing.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is intended to be in multiple variables, and we're to consider the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the c terms. That is, the coefficient would be a polynomial in c, where each term corresponds to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\). But that seems unlikely because the problem is phrased as \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", which usually refers to the coefficient when considering all variables, but in this case, c is separate. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating c as a separate variable, so the coefficient would be the product of the coefficients from each part. Wait, but that doesn't make sense because the two parts are multiplied together, so each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second.\n\nWait, perhaps I should approach it differently. Let me first find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\). Then, I can consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Since these two expansions are multiplied together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, each term contributes to the overall coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, considering all possible powers of c.\n\nWait, but that would mean the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the product of the coefficient from the first part and the sum of coefficients from the second part. Let me test this with a simple example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^1 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). The coefficient of \\(a^1b^0\\) in the first part is 1, and the sum of coefficients in the second part is \\(1 + 1 = 2\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^1b^0\\) in the product would be 1 * 2 = 2. But let's expand it: \\((a + b)(c + 1/c) = a c + a/c + b c + b/c\\). The coefficient of \\(a\\) (which is \\(a^1b^0\\)) is c + 1/c, which is not 2. So, my earlier reasoning was wrong.\n\nTherefore, my initial approach was incorrect. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product isn't simply the product of the coefficient from the first part and the sum of coefficients from the second part. Instead, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part, but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve c, perhaps the only way this can happen is if the second part contributes a constant term. That is, the only way \\(a^2b^2\\) can appear in the product without any c terms is if it's multiplied by the constant term in the second expansion. So, the coefficient would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part.\n\nWait, that makes sense because if you have a term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part and you multiply it by a term from the second part that has \\(c^0\\), then you get \\(a^2b^2\\) times 1, which is just \\(a^2b^2\\). Any other term from the second part would have a power of c, so \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some k, which isn't just \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the only way to get a term that's exactly \\(a^2b^2\\) is to multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by the constant term from the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nOkay, that seems correct. So, let me compute each part separately.\n\nFirst, find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\). Using the binomial theorem, the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^{k}\\). So, the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) occurs is when \\(4 - k = 2\\), which means \\(k = 2\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\).\n\nCalculating \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\): that's \\(4! / (2! * (4 - 2)!) = (24)/(2 * 2) = 24 / 4 = 6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\nNext, find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Again, using the binomial theorem, the expansion is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\).\n\nWe need the exponent of c to be 0, so set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for m: \\(6 = 2m\\) => \\(m = 3\\). So, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\).\n\nCalculating \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\): that's \\(6! / (3! * 3!) = (720)/(6 * 6) = 720 / 36 = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is the product of these two coefficients: 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. When I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by the constant term 20 from the second part, giving \\(20a^2b^2\\). Are there any other terms that would contribute to \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product? For example, if the second part had a term without c, but any other term would have a power of c, so \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some k, which isn't \\(a^2b^2\\) unless k=0. So, yes, only the constant term contributes, so the coefficient is indeed 120.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break down the problem into two parts using the binomial theorem.\n\n1. **Finding the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\):**\n\n   Using the binomial theorem, the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is given by:\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^{k}\n   \\]\n   The term \\(a^2b^2\\) occurs when \\(k = 2\\). The coefficient is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} = \\frac{4!}{2! \\cdot 2!} = 6\n   \\]\n\n2. **Finding the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n\n   Using the binomial theorem, the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is given by:\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n   \\]\n   The term \\(c^0\\) occurs when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which gives \\(m = 3\\). The coefficient is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{6}{3} = \\frac{6!}{3! \\cdot 3!} = 20\n   \\]\n\n3. **Combining the coefficients:**\n\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the product of the coefficients found above:\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 20 = 120\n   \\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

    "text": " \n\nFirst, I remember that when dealing with expansions like \\((a + b)^n\\), we can use the binomial theorem. The binomial theorem states that \\((a + b)^n = \\sum_{k=0}^{n} \\dbinom{n}{k} a^{n - k}b^{k}\\).

Since I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which only comes from the first part, I might think that the second part doesn't affect it. But wait, actually, when multiplying two expressions, each term in the first expansion gets multiplied by each term in the second expansion. However, since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and that term doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), maybe the second part just gets multiplied as a whole.\n\nWait, let me think again. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from \\((a + b)^4\\), so when I multiply it by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the coefficient will be multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part.

But since I'm only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\), does that mean the coefficient is just 6 times the entire expansion of the second part?\n\nWait, that doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not \\(a^2b^2\\) times something else. So, perhaps I need to consider only the constant term from the second expansion because when multiplying, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part would be multiplied by each term in the second part, but we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), meaning the terms where the powers of \\(c\\) cancel out, i.e., the constant term.\n\nWait, no, that might not be correct. Let me clarify: when you multiply two expressions, the coefficients multiply. So, if I have \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part, and then I multiply it by each term in the second expansion, which is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).

So, that would mean that the \\(c\\) terms don't affect the \\(a^2b^2\\) term, because \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).

Let me read the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, the expression is a product of two polynomials. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), and when we multiply by the second part, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. But since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is to multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by the constant term (the term with \\(c^0\\)) from the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nAh, that makes sense. So, I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), and then multiply it by 6 to get the final coefficient.\n\nSo, let's find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Again, using the binomial theorem, we can expand this:\n\n\\[\n\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n\\]\n\nWe need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, because that's the constant term. So, set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\):\n\n\\[\n6 - 2m = 0 \\implies 2m = 6 \\implies m = 3\n\\]\n\nSo, the constant term is when \\(m = 3\\):\n\n\\[\n\\dbinom{6}{3} c^{0} = \\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\n\\]\n\nSo, the constant term is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nWait, let me double-check that. So, in the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6. In the second part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the constant term is 20. So, when we multiply these two, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) (since it's multiplied by the constant term) is 6 * 20 = 120. That seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, another way to think about it is that the entire expression is the product of two independent expansions, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and the constant term in the second part. So, yes, 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nI think that makes sense. So, the final answer should be 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression is found by first determining the coefficient in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplying it by the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20. Thus, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{120}\n\\]"

    "text": " I'm a bit confused because the expression has two parts multiplied together: one involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the other involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). But the term I'm looking for is \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), so maybe I can handle each part separately.\n\nFirst, let me focus on the \\((a + b)^4\\) part. I remember that when expanding a binomial like \\((a + b)^n\\), we can use the binomial theorem, which states that each term is of the form \\(\\dbinom{n}{k}a^{n - k}b^k\\) where \\(k\\) ranges from 0 to \\(n\\). So, in this case, \\(n = 4\\), and I'm looking for the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2, right? So, that would be when \\(a^{4 - k}b^k\\) becomes \\(a^2b^2\\), which means \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\).\n\nLet me write that down: the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). I think that's 6 because \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\\). So, the term is \\(6a^2b^2\\). That part seems straightforward.\n\nNow, the second part of the expression is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). This also looks like a binomial expansion, so I can use the binomial theorem here as well. Each term will be \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - m}\\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying that, it becomes \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - m}c^{-m} = \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\).\n\nBut wait, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\). That means I need the term in the second expansion where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero because \\(c^0 = 1\\), which doesn't affect the term. So, I need to find the value of \\(m\\) such that \\(6 - 2m = 0\\).\n\nLet me solve for \\(m\\):\n\\(6 - 2m = 0\\)\nSubtract 6 from both sides: \\(-2m = -6\\)\nDivide both sides by -2: \\(m = 3\\)\n\nSo, the term where \\(m = 3\\) will give me \\(c^0\\), which is 1. The coefficient for this term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the term is \\(20c^0 = 20\\).\n\nNow, putting it all together. The original expression is the product of \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). We're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which in the first part is 6, and in the second part, the term that doesn't involve \\(c\\) is 20. Since these two parts are multiplied together, their coefficients multiply as well.\n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Let me just make sure I didn't make a mistake here. The first part's coefficient is indeed 6, and the second part's coefficient is 20 when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. Multiplying them gives 120, which seems correct.\n\nWait a second, maybe I should double-check the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me list out the terms to confirm:\n\n- When \\(m = 0\\), term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{0}c^6 = 1 \\times c^6\\)\n- \\(m = 1\\), term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{1}c^{4} = 6c^4\\)\n- \\(m = 2\\), term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{2}c^{2} = 15c^2\\)\n- \\(m = 3\\), term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}c^{0} = 20\\)\n- \\(m = 4\\), term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{4}c^{-2} = 15c^{-2}\\)\n- \\(m = 5\\), term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{5}c^{-4} = 6c^{-4}\\)\n- \\(m = 6\\), term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{6}c^{-6} = 1c^{-6}\\)\n\nYes, that looks correct. The term with \\(c^0\\) is indeed 20. So, multiplying that by the 6 from the first expansion gives 120. I think I'm confident that's the right answer.\n\nJust to recap:\n\n1. Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using binomial theorem to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is 6.\n2. Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) and find the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, which has a coefficient of 20.\n3. Multiply these coefficients together to get the final coefficient in the product, which is 120.\n\nI don't see any mistakes in this reasoning, so I think the answer is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is found by expanding each part separately and then multiplying the relevant coefficients. \n\n1. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n2. The coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n3. Multiplying these gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\boxed{120}"

    "text": " \n\nFirst off, the expression is a product of two binomials raised to powers: \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I remember that when you have a binomial raised to a power, you can expand it using the binomial theorem. The binomial theorem states that \\((x + y)^n = \\sum_{k=0}^{n} \\dbinom{n}{k} x^{n - k} y^{k}\\). So, maybe I can apply this theorem to both parts of the expression separately and then multiply the results together.\n\nLet me start with the first part: \\((a + b)^4\\). Applying the binomial theorem here, each term in the expansion will be of the form \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k} b^{k}\\) for \\(k = 0\\) to \\(4\\). So, the expansion will be:\n\n\\[\n\\dbinom{4}{0}a^4b^0 + \\dbinom{4}{1}a^3b^1 + \\dbinom{4}{2}a^2b^2 + \\dbinom{4}{3}a^1b^3 + \\dbinom{4}{4}a^0b^4\n\\]\n\nSimplifying the coefficients, we have:\n\n\\[\n1 \\cdot a^4 + 4 \\cdot a^3b + 6 \\cdot a^2b^2 + 4 \\cdot ab^3 + 1 \\cdot b^4\n\\]\n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in this part is 6. That seems straightforward.\n\nNow, the second part of the expression is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Again, I'll apply the binomial theorem here. Each term will be \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\), where \\(m\\) ranges from 0 to 6. Let me write that out:\n\n\\[\n\\dbinom{6}{0}c^6 \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^0 + \\dbinom{6}{1}c^5 \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^1 + \\dbinom{6}{2}c^4 \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^2 + \\dbinom{6}{3}c^3 \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^3 + \\dbinom{6}{4}c^2 \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^4 + \\dbinom{6}{5}c^1 \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^5 + \\dbinom{6}{6}c^0 \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\n\\]\n\nSimplifying each term:\n\n- \\(\\dbinom{6}{0}c^6 \\cdot 1 = 1 \\cdot c^6\\)\n- \\(\\dbinom{6}{1}c^5 \\cdot \\dfrac{1}{c} = 6 \\cdot c^{5 - 1} = 6c^4\\)\n- \\(\\dbinom{6}{2}c^4 \\cdot \\dfrac{1}{c^2} = 15 \\cdot c^{4 - 2} = 15c^2\\)\n- \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}c^3 \\cdot \\dfrac{1}{c^3} = 20 \\cdot c^{3 - 3} = 20c^0 = 20\\)\n- \\(\\dbinom{6}{4}c^2 \\cdot \\dfrac{1}{c^4} = 15 \\cdot c^{2 - 4} = 15c^{-2}\\)\n- \\(\\dbinom{6}{5}c^1 \\cdot \\dfrac{1}{c^5} = 6 \\cdot c^{1 - 5} = 6c^{-4}\\)\n- \\(\\dbinom{6}{6}1 \\cdot \\dfrac{1}{c^6} = 1 \\cdot c^{-6}\\)\n\nSo, the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is:\n\n\\[\nc^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15c^{-2} + 6c^{-4} + c^{-6}\n\\]\n\nNow, the original problem is the product of \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).

Looking at the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), the term with \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(6a^2b^2\\). Now, when I multiply this term by each term in the second expansion, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the overall product will be the sum of the products of 6 with each coefficient from the second expansion. However, wait a second\u2014actually, that's not quite right because when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial, and then like terms are combined.\n\nBut in this case, since I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I can note that in the product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will only come from the multiplication of \\(6a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second polynomial. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product will be 6 multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients in the second polynomial, because each term in the second polynomial is a constant (with respect to a and b) multiplied by powers of c.\n\nWait, let me think again. Actually, no, that's not correct. Because when you multiply \\(6a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second polynomial, each of those terms will contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, but only if the term in the second polynomial is a constant (i.e., doesn't involve c). Because if you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by \\(c^k\\), you get \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), which is a different term. So, actually, only the constant term in the second polynomial will affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\).\n\nWait, that seems conflicting with my earlier thought. Let me clarify: when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second, and the exponents add. So, if I have \\(6a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^6\\), that gives \\(6a^2b^2c^6\\), which is a term with \\(a^2b^2c^6\\). Similarly, \\(6a^2b^2\\) times \\(6c^4\\) gives \\(36a^2b^2c^4\\), and so on. So, each of these terms has \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by a power of c, so none of them will contribute to a term that's just \\(a^2b^2\\). The only way to get a term with just \\(a^2b^2\\) is if the second polynomial contributes a constant term (i.e., \\(c^0\\)), which is 20.\n\nTherefore, the only term that will contribute to \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is when \\(6a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by 20. So, the coefficient will be \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nWait, but that seems too straightforward. Let me check again. Maybe I'm missing something. Let me consider the entire product:\n\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\n\\]\n\nEach term in the product will be of the form \\(a^{4 - k}b^k \\times c^{6 - m}c^{-m}\\) for \\(k, m\\) from 0 to 4 and 0 to 6 respectively. Wait, no, actually, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is \\(a^{4 - k}b^k\\) and each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is \\(c^{6 - m} \\times (1/c)^m = c^{6 - 2m}\\).\n\nSo, when you multiply \\(a^{4 - k}b^k\\) by \\(c^{6 - 2m}\\), you get \\(a^{4 - k}b^k c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, if you want the term \\(a^2b^2\\), that occurs when \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). So, that term is \\(6a^2b^2\\). Now, when you multiply this by each term in the second polynomial, you get terms like \\(6a^2b^2c^{6 - 2m}\\). But you are only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would require that the exponent of c is zero, i.e., \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving that, \\(6 - 2m = 0\\) gives \\(m = 3\\). So, the only term in the second polynomial that contributes to \\(a^2b^2\\) is when \\(m = 3\\), which is the term \\(20\\), as I found earlier.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient is indeed \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nWait, but let me think again. Maybe I should consider that the entire product is a product of two polynomials, each with their own variables. So, when you multiply them, the variables a, b, and c are all independent. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product can only come from multiplying a term in the first polynomial that has \\(a^2b^2\\) by a term in the second polynomial that has \\(c^0\\), because any other power of c would result in a term with \\(c\\) involved, which would make it \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), not just \\(a^2b^2\\).\n\nTherefore, the only contribution to \\(a^2b^2\\) is from \\(6a^2b^2 \\times 20\\), which is 120a^2b^2. So, the coefficient is 120.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check. Suppose I didn't think about it that way. Suppose I consider the entire product and look for all possible ways to get \\(a^2b^2\\). Since the variables are independent, the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) is to take \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part and \\(c^0\\) from the second part. So, that's exactly what I did earlier. So, the coefficient is indeed 6 times 20, which is 120.\n\nAlternatively, if I were to expand the entire product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would only come from \\(6a^2b^2 \\times 20\\), so 120a^2b^2.\n\nWait, but perhaps I should think about whether there are other terms that could contribute to \\(a^2b^2\\). For example, could a term from the first polynomial with a higher power of a or b, when multiplied by a term from the second polynomial with negative exponents, somehow cancel out the exponents to give \\(a^2b^2\\)? Let me check.\n\nSuppose I take a term from the first polynomial, say \\(a^4\\), and multiply it by a term from the second polynomial that has \\(c^{-2}\\), but in terms of a and b, is there any way that a^4 times something could give a^2b^2? No, because the second polynomial only involves c, not a or b. So, the second polynomial's terms don't affect the exponents of a and b; they only affect the exponents of c. Therefore, the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) is by taking \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first polynomial and multiplying it by the constant term (i.e., \\(c^0\\)) from the second polynomial.\n\nTherefore, my initial conclusion seems correct: the coefficient is 120.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in calculating the coefficients. Let me re-examine the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). The term when m=3 is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}c^{3} \\times (1/c)^3 = 20 \\times c^{0} = 20\\). So that's correct.\n\nAnd in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6, as calculated earlier.\n\nSo, multiplying 6 by 20 gives 120. Therefore, the coefficient is 120.\n\nI think that's the correct answer. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by identifying the relevant terms in each binomial expansion and then multiplying their coefficients. \n\n1. Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is 6.\n2. Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) and identify the constant term (where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0), which is 20.\n3. Multiply these coefficients: \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nThus, the coefficient is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

So the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, but since the second expansion has terms in \\(c\\), none of those will affect the variables \\(a\\) and \\(b\\).

Because each term in the second expansion contributes its own coefficient when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), so the total coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) across all possible \\(c\\) terms is the product of the two coefficients.\n\nWait, no, that's not quite right. Because when you multiply two polynomials, each term from the first is multiplied by each term from the second. So if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, it's actually the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the sum of all coefficients in the second part, because each term in the second part will multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term, contributing their own coefficients. So the total coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) would be \\([ \\text{coeff of } a^2b^2 \\text{ in } (a + b)^4 ] \\times [ \\text{sum of coefficients in } \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 ]\\).\n\nBut wait, is that correct? Let me think of a simpler example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)(c + d)\\). The coefficient of \\(a\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a\\) in the first part, which is 1, multiplied by the sum of coefficients in the second part, which is \\(1 + 1 = 2\\), so the coefficient of \\(a\\) in the product would be 2. But in reality, the product is \\(ac + ad + bc + bd\\), so the coefficient of \\(a\\) is indeed 2, as \\(ac\\) and \\(ad\\) both have \\(a\\) with coefficients 1 each, so total 2. So yes, that seems correct.\n\nTherefore, applying that to the original problem, I can compute the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\), and then multiply it by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nNow, what's the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)? The sum of coefficients in a polynomial is found by substituting 1 for all variables. So if I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = (1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So the sum of coefficients in the second part is 64.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). So the answer should be 384.\n\nWait, but let me double-check to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Maybe I can approach it another way.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of the entire expression as the product of two separate expansions. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion is 6, as I found. The second expansion, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), when expanded, has terms from \\(c^6\\) down to \\(c^{-6}\\), each with their own coefficients. But when I multiply the first expansion by the second, each term \\(a^kb^{4 - k}\\) from the first will be multiplied by each term \\(c^mc^{-n}\\) from the second, where \\(m + n = 6\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is \\(k = 2\\), the coefficient will be 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, as before. So 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Is the sum of coefficients in the second expansion really 64? Because \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) evaluated at \\(c = 1\\) is indeed 2^6 = 64, which is correct. So that part checks out.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of the entire product as a single expression, but I don't think that's necessary here. Since the variables are separate, I can treat them independently.\n\nWait, but another thought: Maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), because otherwise, if it's just \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\), then the coefficient would be 6 * 64 = 384, as I thought. But perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\), which is 1. In that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion.\n\nWait, that's a different interpretation. So maybe I misread the problem. Let me check again: It says, \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So it's possible that the problem is asking for the coefficient of the term \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2 and 2, respectively, and the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0. Alternatively, it could be that the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, in which case it would be 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nBut perhaps the problem is more precise, and it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by some power of \\(c\\), but without specifying the power, so it's ambiguous. However, given the way it's written, it's more likely that it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which would be 384. But to be thorough, let me check both interpretations.\n\nFirst, if it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), then it's 384, as above.\n\nIf it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then we need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion. The coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is the middle term, which is when the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0. Let me calculate that.\n\nThe general term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We want the exponent of \\(c\\) to be 0, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\). So the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) would be 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, so now I'm confused because the problem could be interpreted in two ways. Let me try to see which makes more sense.\n\nThe problem says, \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" The term \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't include \\(c\\), so it's possible that the problem is asking for the coefficient of the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\), which would be 120. Alternatively, it's possible that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which would be 384.\n\nBut in the context of such problems, usually, when they ask for the coefficient of a term that doesn't involve another variable, they're referring to the coefficient when that term is multiplied by all possible terms in the other variables. So in this case, since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but in the example I thought of earlier, where I had \\((a + b)(c + d)\\), the coefficient of \\(a\\) in the product is 2, which comes from \\(a \\times c\\) and \\(a \\times d\\), so each contributing 1, totaling 2. So in that case, it's the coefficient of \\(a\\) times the sum of coefficients in the second polynomial. So by analogy, in the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, giving 384.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem had asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it would be 6 times 20, which is 120. But since the problem didn't specify \\(c^0\\), just \\(a^2b^2\\), I think it's more likely that it's asking for 384.\n\nWait, but let me check with an example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^2 (c + 1/c)^1\\). Let's compute the coefficient of \\(a^2b^0\\) in this product. The first part is \\((a + b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2\\). The second part is \\(c + 1/c\\). So the product is \\((a^2 + 2ab + b^2)(c + 1/c)\\). The coefficient of \\(a^2\\) would be 1 times the sum of coefficients in the second part, which is \\(1 + 1 = 2\\), so 1 * 2 = 2. But in reality, the product is \\(a^2c + a^2/c + 2abc + 2ab/c + b^2c + b^2/c\\). The coefficient of \\(a^2\\) is indeed 2, as \\(a^2c\\) and \\(a^2/c\\) both have coefficient 1 each, so total 2. So yes, that supports the idea that the coefficient is the product of the coefficient in the first part and the sum of coefficients in the second part.\n\nTherefore, in the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me check again with the second interpretation. If I were to compute the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), that would be 6 * 20 = 120, as above. So depending on the problem's intention, it could be either 384 or 120. But given that the problem didn't specify \\(c^0\\), I think it's more likely 384.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is written in a way that the entire expression is considered, and the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is present regardless of \\(c\\), so the coefficient would be 384. So I think I should go with 384 as the answer.\n\nBut just to make sure, let me compute both ways.\n\nFirst, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\): 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nSecond, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\): 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but perhaps I can compute the entire expansion and see what the coefficient is. Although that might be time-consuming, maybe I can compute a part of it.\n\nWait, but another thought: When you have two polynomials multiplied together, the coefficient of a term in one polynomial is multiplied by all terms in the other polynomial. So the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial, because each term in the second polynomial contributes its coefficient when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\).\n\nTherefore, the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial is 64, as found earlier, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nYes, that makes sense. Therefore, I think the answer is 384.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{384}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break down the problem into two parts using the binomial theorem.\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   The general term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is given by:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k} b^k\n   \\]\n   We are interested in the term where \\(k = 2\\), which is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} a^{2} b^{2} = 6a^2b^2\n   \\]\n   Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\n2. **Sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   The sum of all coefficients in a polynomial is found by substituting 1 for all variables. Thus, we evaluate:\n   \\[\n   \\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\n   \\]\n   This means the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 64.\n\n3. **Combine the results:**\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the product of the coefficient from the first part and the sum of coefficients from the second part:\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 64 = 384\n   \\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\boxed{384}\\)."

    "text": " I'm a bit confused because the expression has two parts multiplied together, each raised to a power. I think I need to expand both parts separately and then see how they combine, but maybe there's a smarter way.\n\nFirst, let me focus on the first part: \\((a + b)^4\\). I remember that when you expand a binomial like \\((x + y)^n\\), you can use the binomial theorem, which says that each term is of the form \\(\\dbinom{n}{k}x^{n - k}y^{k}\\). So for \\((a + b)^4\\), each term will be \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}a^{4 - k}b^{k}\\), right?\n\nI need the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). That means I need the term where \\(a\\) is squared and \\(b\\) is squared. So, let me find \\(k\\) such that \\(4 - k = 2\\) for \\(a\\) and \\(k = 2\\) for \\(b\\). So, \\(k = 2\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So the coefficient from the first part is 6.\n\nNow, moving on to the second part: \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). This also looks like a binomial expansion. Using the same binomial theorem, each term will be \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - m}\\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Let me simplify that term: \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - m} \\times c^{-m} = \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\).\n\nWait, but in the original problem, I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). The second part is in terms of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), so when I multiply the two parts together, I'm going to have terms that are products of terms from each expansion. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\). That means I need the constant term in the second part, right? Because when I multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), the \\(c\\) terms will just tag along, but if I want the term where there's only \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\), then the second part must contribute a constant term.\n\nSo, to get a constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the exponent of \\(c\\) should be zero. So, from the term \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\), we need \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), \\(6 = 2m\\) so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). So the constant term is 20.\n\nWait, hold on. Let me make sure I did that right. \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\) is 20? Let me compute it again: 6 choose 3 is (6 \u00d7 5 \u00d7 4)/(3 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 1) = 120/6 = 20. Yes, that's correct.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first part with coefficient 6, and the constant term from the second part is 20. So when I multiply these together, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) times the constant term is 6 \u00d7 20 = 120.\n\nWait a second, but let me think again. Is that the only contribution? Because when I multiply the two expansions, each term from the first expansion is multiplied by each term from the second. But since I'm only interested in the term where the \\(c\\) terms cancel out (i.e., the constant term), that's the only term that will result in a pure \\(a^2b^2\\) term without any \\(c\\) involved. So yes, that should be the only contribution.\n\nBut just to double-check, let me consider the entire expression: \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When expanded, it's a sum of terms each of the form \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}a^{4 - k}b^{k} \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, for each \\(k\\) and \\(m\\), we have a term \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}\\dbinom{6}{m} a^{4 - k}b^{k}c^{6 - 2m}\\).\n\nWe are interested in the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present, which requires \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\), as I did before. So \\(k = 2\\), giving \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Now, for the same term, we need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be zero, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\) which gives \\(m = 3\\), and \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, the coefficient is indeed 6 \u00d7 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but I just want to make sure that when I multiply these two parts, the only term that contributes to \\(a^2b^2\\) is when the second part is the constant term. Because if the second part had a non-zero exponent, then the term would include \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), which would make the overall term have \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or something, which isn't what we want. So yes, only the constant term in the second part will contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\).\n\nSo, I think I'm confident that the coefficient is 120. Let me just write that down.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem for each part separately.\n\nFirst, consider the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\). Using the binomial theorem, each term is of the form \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}a^{4 - k}b^{k}\\). We need the term where \\(a\\) is squared and \\(b\\) is squared, which corresponds to \\(k = 2\\). The coefficient is:\n\\[\n\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\n\\]\n\nNext, consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem, each term is of the form \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - m}\\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\). We need the constant term, which occurs when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. Solving \\(6 - 2m = 0\\) gives \\(m = 3\\). The constant term is:\n\\[\n\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\n\\]\n\nMultiplying the coefficients from both parts gives the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\):\n\\[\n6 \\times 20 = 120\n\\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

    "text": " \n\nFirst, I think I should handle each part of the expression separately before combining them. The expression is a product of two binomial expansions: one involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the other involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). Since I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), maybe I can focus on the first part first and then see how the second part affects it.\n\nStarting with \\((a + b)^4\\), I remember that the expansion of \\((a + b)^n\\) is given by the binomial theorem, which states that:\n\\[\n(a + b)^n = \\sum_{k=0}^{n} \\dbinom{n}{k} a^{n - k} b^{k}\n\\]\nSo, for \\(n = 4\\), the expansion will be:\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\dbinom{4}{0}a^4b^0 + \\dbinom{4}{1}a^3b^1 + \\dbinom{4}{2}a^2b^2 + \\dbinom{4}{3}a^1b^3 + \\dbinom{4}{4}a^0b^4\n\\]\nCalculating the binomial coefficients:\n- \\(\\dbinom{4}{0} = 1\\)\n- \\(\\dbinom{4}{1} = 4\\)\n- \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\)\n- \\(\\dbinom{4}{3} = 4\\)\n- \\(\\dbinom{4}{4} = 1\\)\n\nSo, the expansion becomes:\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\n\\]\nOkay, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in this part is 6. But wait, the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), so I need to consider how that affects the coefficient.\n\nLet me think about this. When I multiply two expressions together, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression. So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I need to consider how it interacts with the terms in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nBut here's the thing: the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is from the first part, and the second part involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). Since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are different variables, the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) won't affect the exponents of \\(c\\). That means that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. But wait, no, that's not quite right because each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion.\n\nWait, no, I think I'm getting confused here. Let me clarify. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just the coefficient from the first part, because when you multiply by the second part, which only involves \\(c\\), the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will be multiplied by every term in the second expansion. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), does that mean that the coefficient remains the same? Hmm, that doesn't seem right.\n\nWait, no, actually, when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficients of the terms in the product are determined by the sum of the products of the coefficients of terms whose variables multiply to give the desired term. But in this case, since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), any term from the second expansion will multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) to give a term that includes \\(c\\) raised to some power. Therefore, the only way \\(a^2b^2\\) can appear in the product is if it's multiplied by a term in the second expansion that has \\(c^0\\), i.e., a constant term. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part.\n\nAh, that makes sense! So, I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me work on that.\n\nUsing the binomial theorem again, the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is:\n\\[\n\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n\\]\nI need to find the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0 because that's the constant term. So, set the exponent equal to 0:\n\\[\n6 - 2k = 0 \\implies 2k = 6 \\implies k = 3\n\\]\nSo, the constant term is when \\(k = 3\\), and the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\).\n\nCalculating that:\n\\[\n\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\n\\]\nWait, no, that's not correct. Let me compute it properly. \n\n\\(6! = 720\\), \\(3! = 6\\), so:\n\\[\n\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{720}{(6)(6)} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\n\\]\nYes, that's correct. So, the constant term is 20.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the constant term from the second part, which is 20. So, 6 times 20 is 120.\n\nWait, but let me double-check that. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 20. Since when you multiply the two expressions together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second part. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), the only contribution comes from multiplying \\(a^2b^2\\) by the constant term in the second expansion.

    "text": " I'm a bit confused, but I'll take it slow.\n\nFirst, I remember that when you have an expression like \\((x + y)^n\\), you can expand it using the binomial theorem. The binomial theorem says that each term in the expansion is of the form \\(\\dbinom{n}{k}x^{n - k}y^{k}\\), where \\(\\dbinom{n}{k}\\) is the binomial coefficient, which can be found using combinations. So maybe I can apply that here.\n\nLooking at the problem, I see two parts: \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but wait, that term is only in the first part, right? Because \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are only in the first binomial, and \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) are in the second. So does that mean that the second part doesn't affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)? Hmm, maybe I should think about that.\n\nWait, no, actually, the entire expression is the product of the two binomials. So when I multiply them out, each term from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term from the second expansion. But since I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which comes from the first part, maybe the second part just contributes a factor that doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\). So perhaps I can find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and then multiply it by the entire expansion of the second part, but since I'm only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), the other terms from the second expansion might not matter? Hmm, I'm not sure. Let me think again.\n\nWait, no, actually, when I expand the entire expression, each term will be of the form \\((a + b)^4\\) term multiplied by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) term. But since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are only in the first part, any term from the second part won't affect the powers of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). So the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But wait, that doesn't make sense because the second part has variables \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), which aren't present in the term \\(a^2b^2\\). So maybe I'm supposed to consider that \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term that's independent of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), so the coefficient would just be the product of the coefficients from each part.\n\nWait, but that doesn't seem right either. Let me try to clarify. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product. So when I expand \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in the product will be a term from the first expansion multiplied by a term from the second expansion. So if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I need to consider all the terms in the product where the powers of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2 each, and the powers of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) can be anything, but since I'm only interested in \\(a^2b^2\\), the other variables don't matter for the coefficient.\n\nWait, no, actually, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is only from the first part, so in the product, each term will have some power of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) from the first part and some power of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) from the second part. But the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So maybe the coefficient is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Because when you multiply, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), so the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the sum of all coefficients in the second part.\n\nWait, that makes sense. Because when you multiply by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is scaled by each term in the second expansion. So the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) would be (coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in first part) multiplied by (sum of coefficients in the second part). So I need to compute both parts.\n\nFirst, let's find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\). Using the binomial theorem, the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k}a^{4 - k}b^{k}\\). So the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) occurs is when \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). So the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\), which is 6.\n\nNext, I need to find the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). The sum of coefficients in a polynomial is found by setting all variables to 1. So if I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(1 + 1/1\\right)^6 = (2)^6 = 64\\). So the sum of coefficients in the second part is 64.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me double-check that. So the first part gives me 6 for \\(a^2b^2\\), and the second part, when I set \\(c = 1\\), gives me 64. So when I multiply these, I get 6 * 64 = 384. So the coefficient is 384.\n\nAlternatively, another way to think about it is that when you multiply two expressions, the coefficient of a specific term in one expression is multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the other expression. So yeah, that seems correct.\n\nWait, but let me consider another approach to make sure. Let's think about expanding both expressions separately and then multiplying them. The expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) includes terms like \\(a^4\\), \\(4a^3b\\), \\(6a^2b^2\\), \\(4ab^3\\), and \\(b^4\\). The expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) will have terms like \\(c^6\\), \\(6c^5*(1/c)\\), which is \\(6c^4\\), and so on, up to \\(1/c^6\\).\n\nWhen I multiply these two expansions, each term from the first is multiplied by each term from the second. But since I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I can ignore the terms from the second expansion because they don't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. So the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) will be the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients from the second part, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but is there another way to see this? Let me think. If I have two polynomials, P(a, b) and Q(c), then the coefficient of a term like \\(a^2b^2\\) in their product P(a, b) * Q(c) would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in P(a, b) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in Q(c). Because Q(c) is a polynomial in c, and when you multiply by it, each term in P(a, b) is scaled by each term in Q(c). So when you collect like terms, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient in P(a, b) times the sum of coefficients in Q(c).\n\nYes, that makes sense. So in this case, P(a, b) is \\((a + b)^4\\) and Q(c) is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me check if I calculated the sum of coefficients correctly. For Q(c) = \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the sum of coefficients is when c = 1, so \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). That's correct.\n\nAnd for \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). So 6 * 64 = 384. I think that's right.\n\nWait, another way to think about it: when you have a product of two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in one polynomial is multiplied by the sum of all terms in the other polynomial. So yeah, that's consistent.\n\nI think I've double-checked it enough. So the coefficient is 384.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{384}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break down the problem into two parts using the binomial theorem.\n\n1. **Finding the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\):**\n   Using the binomial theorem, the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is given by:\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k} b^k\n   \\]\n   The term \\(a^2b^2\\) occurs when \\(k = 2\\), so the coefficient is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\n   \\]\n\n2. **Finding the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   The sum of the coefficients in a polynomial is found by setting all variables to 1.

The coefficient here is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Let me calculate that. \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\).

So, I think I need to consider how this term interacts with the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nHold on, let me clarify. The expression is a product of two separate binomial expansions: one involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the other involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). Since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I think that term doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\). So, perhaps the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just the same as the coefficient in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but since we're only interested in \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), maybe we don't need to consider the \\(c\\) terms?\n\nWait, that doesn't seem right. Let me think again. When we multiply two expressions together, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by every term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would actually be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nBut wait, that doesn't seem right either because \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), so when you multiply it by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), you would get terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), and so on, but none of these would be just \\(a^2b^2\\). So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be zero because \\(a^2b^2\\) is not present in the product unless there's a term that cancels out the \\(c\\) terms.\n\nWait, now I'm confused. Let me clarify the problem again. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, in other words, when you expand the entire expression, what's the coefficient for the term that has \\(a^2b^2\\) and any combination of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) terms. But actually, the question is phrased as \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", which usually refers to the term where the variables are exactly \\(a^2b^2\\), but in this case, since the entire expression also includes \\(c\\) terms, perhaps the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by some power of \\(c\\), so maybe the coefficient is actually the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times the sum of all coefficients in the other expansion?\n\nWait, no, that's not correct. Let me think again. When you have a product of two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each polynomial. But in this case, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is only present in the first polynomial, \\((a + b)^4\\), and the second polynomial, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), doesn't have any \\(a\\) or \\(b\\) terms. So, when you multiply them, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in the second polynomial, which are all powers of \\(c\\). Therefore, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will appear in the product as \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), \\(a^2b^2c^2\\), \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), \\(a^2b^2c^{-2}\\), \\(a^2b^2c^{-4}\\), and \\(a^2b^2c^{-6}\\), each with their respective coefficients.\n\nBut the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). However, in the product, \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by various powers of \\(c\\), so unless we're considering \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by \\(c^0\\), which is just \\(a^2b^2\\), but in the product, that term would be present. Wait, no, because \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) does have a term with \\(c^0\\), which is the constant term. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by the constant term of the second polynomial would be \\(a^2b^2\\) times that constant. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second polynomial.\n\nWait, that makes sense. So, to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which I already found to be 6, and then multiply it by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nSo, now I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me think about how to do that. Again, using the binomial theorem, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\).\n\nWe need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so we set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}c^{0}\\), so the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\).\n\nCalculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20.\n\nTherefore, going back to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the two coefficients we found: 6 (from \\((a + b)^4\\)) multiplied by 20 (from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)), which is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nWait, but let me double-check that. So, in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term is a product of a term from the first expansion and a term from the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\), and to get \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, we need to multiply it by the term \\(c^0\\) from the second expansion, because any other term would introduce a power of \\(c\\) which would make it not just \\(a^2b^2\\). So, yes, that makes sense. So, the coefficient is indeed 6 times 20, which is 120.\n\nAlternatively, another way to think about it is that when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term is the sum of the products of coefficients of terms whose exponents add up to the desired term. But in this case, since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is by multiplying \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first polynomial with \\(c^0\\) from the second polynomial. So, that's why we just multiply the two coefficients.\n\nLet me just verify the calculations again to be sure.\n\nFirst, \\((a + b)^4\\): the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). That's correct.\n\nNext, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\): we need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0. So, the general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\\). Setting \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). That's correct.\n\nMultiplying these together: \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). So, the coefficient is 120.\n\nI think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in the reasoning. So, the final answer should be 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Multiplying these together gives the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression as \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{120}\n\\]"

So, for \\((a + b)^4\\), each term will be \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k} b^{k}\\) where \\(k\\) goes from 0 to 4.\n\nNow, I'm specifically looking for the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2. That means I need \\(a^2b^2\\). So, in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\), which term is that? Let's see, since the exponents add up to 4, if \\(a\\) is squared, then \\(b\\) must also be squared because \\(2 + 2 = 4\\). So, the term is when \\(k = 2\\), because \\(b^k\\) would be \\(b^2\\). \n\nCalculating the coefficient for this term: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). I think that's 6 because \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient from the first part is 6.\n\nNow, looking at the second part of the expression: \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).

But wait, the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is part of the product. However, in the original problem, I think it's implied that we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, maybe the \\(c\\) terms don't affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), because \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\).\n\nWait, actually, no. The problem is written as \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when you multiply these two expansions together, each term from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term from the second expansion. But the question is specifically about the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would be the term in the first expansion multiplied by any term in the second expansion. However, since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the entire second expansion. But that doesn't make sense because the second expansion includes terms with \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), so the product would have terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2/c^k\\), but the coefficient for each of those would still be 6 times the coefficient from the second expansion.\n\nWait, but the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not multiplied by any \\(c\\) terms. So, perhaps the second part is being treated as a separate factor, and the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just the coefficient from the first expansion, which is 6, and then the second expansion's terms don't affect it because they're multiplied by different variables. Hmm, but that seems too simple. Let me think again.\n\nWait, no, the problem is written as a product of two expressions: \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when you multiply them, each term from the first expansion is multiplied by each term from the second expansion.

But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would require that the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero because otherwise, the term would be \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) where \\(k \\neq 0\\), which wouldn't be just \\(a^2b^2\\).\n\nWait, that makes sense. So, I need to find the term in the second expansion \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) that has \\(c^0\\), because when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), it would give \\(a^2b^2c^0 = a^2b^2\\), which is what we're looking for. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 (from the first part) multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part.\n\nSo, let's find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem again, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We want the exponent of \\(c\\) to be zero, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\).\n\nTherefore, the term when \\(k = 3\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} c^{0}\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20.\n\nNow, putting it all together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the second part), which is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nWait, let me double-check that. So, in the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. In the second part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. So, when you multiply these two expressions, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But since we're only interested in the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, which is 20, the total coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but let me think again: when you have two separate variables, \\(a, b\\) and \\(c\\), and you're expanding the product, each term in the product will be a combination of a term from the first expansion and a term from the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, which includes different powers of \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). Wait, no, actually, the problem is written as a single expression, so \\(a^2b^2\\) would only be present when multiplied by \\(c^0\\), because otherwise, it would have some power of \\(c\\). So, the only term that contributes to \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms is when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by the \\(c^0\\) term from the second expansion.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient is indeed 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because sometimes when you have products of polynomials, the coefficients can add up if there are multiple ways to get the same term. But in this case, since \\(a, b\\) and \\(c\\) are different variables, the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) is by taking \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part and \\(c^0\\) from the second part. There's no other combination that would give \\(a^2b^2\\) because any other term from the second expansion would have a power of \\(c\\), making it \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), which is a different term. So, the coefficient is just 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Suppose I didn't consider the \\(c\\) terms. If the problem was just \\((a + b)^4\\), then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. But since it's multiplied by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is another expansion, the entire expression becomes a product of two polynomials. So, each term in the product is a product of terms from each polynomial. Therefore, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) can only come from \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and the constant term (i.e., \\(c^0\\)) in the second part. Therefore, the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem had asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some \\(k\\), then the coefficient would be 6 * (coefficient of \\(c^k\\) in the second expansion). But since it's just \\(a^2b^2\\), we need \\(k = 0\\), so it's 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but I'm still a bit unsure because sometimes when you have products, you might have cross terms, but in this case, since \\(a, b\\) and \\(c\\) are separate variables, their exponents don't interfere. So, I think my reasoning is correct.\n\nLet me recap:\n\n1. Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is 6.\n\n2. Expand \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\), which is 20.\n\n3. Multiply these two coefficients together because the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion must be multiplied by the constant term in the second expansion to result in \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms.\n\n4. So, 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient is 120.\n\nWait, but I just thought of another way: maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, which would include all possible combinations of \\(c\\) terms. But no, that doesn't make sense because \\(a^2b^2\\) is just a term with \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), so unless it's multiplied by \\(c^0\\), it wouldn't be just \\(a^2b^2\\). So, I think my initial approach is correct.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem was \\((a + b + c + 1/c)^{10}\\) or something, then the variables are mixed, but in this case, they're separate. So, yeah, I think 120 is the correct answer.\n\nWait, just to make sure, let me compute the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) again. In \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\times (1/c)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, setting the exponent to zero: 6 - 2k = 0 \u2192 k = 3. So, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\) which is 20. So, that's correct.\n\nAnd the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is indeed \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) which is 6. So, 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nI think that's solid. So, the coefficient is 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem for both parts of the expression.\n\n1. **Expanding \\((a + b)^4\\)**:\n   Using the binomial theorem, the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is given by:\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k} b^{k}\n   \\]\n   We need the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2, which occurs when \\(k = 2\\). The coefficient for this term is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\n   \\]\n\n2. **Expanding \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)**:\n   Using the binomial theorem, the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is given by:\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n   \\]\n   We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, which occurs when \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(k = 3\\). The coefficient for this term is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\n   \\]\n\n3. **Combining the coefficients**:\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is the product of the coefficients found in the two expansions:\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 20 = 120\n   \\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

    "text": " I'm a bit nervous because I'm not super confident with binomial expansions, but I think I can handle it.\n\nFirst, I remember that when you have an expression like \\((x + y)^n\\), you can expand it using the binomial theorem. The binomial theorem says that each term in the expansion is of the form \\(\\dbinom{n}{k}x^{n - k}y^{k}\\), right? So, the coefficient of each term is given by the binomial coefficient \\(\\dbinom{n}{k}\\).\n\nIn this problem, I see two separate binomial expressions multiplied together: \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The term we're interested in is \\(a^2b^2\\). Since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are only in the first part of the expression, maybe I can focus on expanding just that part first and then see how it interacts with the second part.\n\nLet me start with \\((a + b)^4\\). Using the binomial theorem, the expansion will have terms like \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}a^{4 - k}b^{k}\\) for \\(k = 0\\) to \\(4\\). Since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I need to find the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2 each. That means \\(4 - k = 2\\) for \\(a\\), so \\(k = 2\\). Therefore, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\).\n\nCalculating that, \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient from the first part is 6.\n\nNow, the second part of the expression is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I need to figure out what this expands to. Again, using the binomial theorem, each term will be \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - m}\\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying that, each term becomes \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - m - m} = \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\).\n\nWait, but in the original problem, we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Now, I'm a bit confused because \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) don't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\). So, does that mean that when I multiply the two expansions together, the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) will be multiplied by terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), but since we're only interested in \\(a^2b^2\\), the coefficient won't depend on the \\(c\\) terms? Or do I need to consider something else?\n\nWait, no, I think I'm overcomplicating it. Since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are in one part of the product and \\(c\\) is in the other, the variables are separate. So, when we multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term from the first expansion, and it's multiplied by all terms from the second expansion. But wait, the problem just asks for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, right?\n\nWait, actually, no, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term in the entire expression. But in the entire expression, each term would be of the form \\(a^k b^{4 - k} c^m\\) or something like that, but since we're only interested in \\(a^2b^2\\), perhaps we can consider that the coefficient is just the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but I'm not sure.\n\nWait, no, that doesn't make sense because when you multiply two polynomials, each term is a product of terms from each polynomial. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term from the second part, which are in terms of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but in the entire product, \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by various powers of \\(c\\). So, perhaps the problem is actually just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable, but perhaps we're supposed to consider the entire product and find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). Hmm, that might not be the case.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misinterpreting the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, which would be the product of the two expansions. So, in that case, the coefficient would be the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that doesn't make sense because then the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\), not a single number.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. Maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when considering the entire expression, but since \\(c\\) is a different variable, perhaps the coefficient is just the product of the coefficients from each part. Wait, but that doesn't seem right either because each term in the product would be a combination of the terms from each expansion.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable, so the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\). But that seems complicated, and I don't think that's what is intended here.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think again. The problem is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). When you multiply these two expressions, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, which are terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so perhaps it's just the coefficient from the first part, because the second part is multiplied by all the terms, but since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term in the first part, and it's multiplied by the entire second expansion, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient from the first part times the entire second expansion. But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misinterpreting the problem. Maybe it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, but considering that the product includes terms with \\(c\\). So, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times some power of \\(c\\). But the problem doesn't specify a particular power of \\(c\\), so maybe it's just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. That is, the coefficient would be the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion and the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion. But that doesn't make sense because the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion is when \\(c = 1\\), which would be \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, the coefficient would be 6 * 64 = 384. But I'm not sure if that's what the problem is asking.\n\nWait, let me check the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, perhaps the problem is considering the entire product as a single expression and wants the coefficient of the term that has \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would make the coefficient a polynomial, not a single number. So, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is written incorrectly, or perhaps I'm misinterpreting it. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable, so the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\). But that seems complicated, and I don't think that's the case.\n\nWait, another thought: perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, and since \\(c\\) is a separate variable, the coefficient is just the product of the coefficients from each part, but that doesn't seem right because the two parts are multiplied together, so each term in the product is a combination of terms from each.\n\nWait, maybe I should consider that the entire expression is a product of two polynomials, and the term \\(a^2b^2\\) can be combined with any term from the second polynomial, but since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), perhaps it's considering all possible terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, the coefficient would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients from the second part. That is, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). The sum of the coefficients in a polynomial is found by setting all variables to 1, so \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient would be 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nBut I'm not entirely sure if that's what the problem is asking. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), that is, the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\). That would make sense because then the coefficient would be a single number. So, to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), we would need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part, then multiply them together.\n\nThat seems plausible. So, let me try that approach. First, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, as I found earlier. Now, in the second part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\), which is the constant term. Because \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\) would give \\(a^2b^2\\), which is the term we're interested in.\n\nSo, how do I find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\)? Using the binomial theorem again, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - m} \\times \\left(1/c\\right)^m = \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\). We want the exponent of \\(c\\) to be 0, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which gives \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\), which is \\(\\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\).\n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire product is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the second part), which is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, that makes sense. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, considering only the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, is 120.\n\nLet me double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake. First, I found the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) correctly as 6. Then, I realized that to get the term \\(a^2b^2\\), it must be multiplied by \\(c^0\\) from the second expansion. I then found the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) by setting the exponent of \\(c\\) to zero, which gave me \\(m = 3\\), and the coefficient was \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying these together gives 6 * 20 = 120. That seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem had been asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some specific \\(k\\), then we would have to find the corresponding term in the second expansion. But since the problem just says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", I think it's safe to assume that it's referring to the term where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out, i.e., \\(c^0\\), because otherwise, the coefficient would depend on the power of \\(c\\), which isn't specified. So, I think 120 is the correct answer.\n\nJust to make sure, let me consider an alternative approach. If I were to expand both expressions separately and then multiply them, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would come from the first part, and it would be multiplied by each term in the second part. However, since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and not \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some \\(k\\), it's implied that we're looking for the coefficient when the exponents of \\(c\\) are zero, i.e., the constant term. Therefore, the coefficient is indeed 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nI think that makes sense. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning, so I'm confident that 120 is the correct coefficient.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion is found by considering the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\):**\n   - The term \\(a^2b^2\\) has a coefficient of \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n\n2. **Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   - The constant term (where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0) occurs when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), so \\(m = 3\\).\n   - The coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n\n3. **Multiply the coefficients:**\n   - \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer:** \\(\\boxed{120}\\)"

    "text": " \n\nFirst, I know that when dealing with expressions raised to a power, the binomial theorem is super useful. The binomial theorem states that \\((x + y)^n = \\sum_{k=0}^{n} \\dbinom{n}{k} x^{n - k} y^k\\). So, maybe I can apply this theorem to both parts of the given expression separately and then multiply the results.\n\nLet me start with the first part: \\((a + b)^4\\). Using the binomial theorem, the expansion of this would be the sum from \\(k = 0\\) to \\(4\\) of \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k} b^k\\). So, each term is \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k} b^k\\).\n\nNow, I'm specifically looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). That means I need the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2. Let me set up the equation for the exponents: \\(4 - k = 2\\) for \\(a\\) and \\(k = 2\\) for \\(b\\). Solving \\(4 - k = 2\\) gives \\(k = 2\\). So, the term I need is when \\(k = 2\\). \n\nCalculating the binomial coefficient for this term: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). I remember that \\(\\dbinom{n}{k} = \\dfrac{n!}{k!(n - k)!}\\). Plugging in the values: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient from the first part is 6, and the term is \\(6a^2b^2\\).\n\nOkay, so that's the first part done. Now, moving on to the second part: \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Again, I can apply the binomial theorem here. The expansion will be the sum from \\(m = 0\\) to \\(6\\) of \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\).\n\nLet me simplify each term. The term will be \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\times c^{-m}\\) because \\(\\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = c^{-m}\\). Combining the exponents, this becomes \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\).\n\nNow, since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which only involves \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), the term involving \\(c\\) can be anything, but we need to consider how the two parts multiply together. Wait, actually, since the entire expression is the product of \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the expansion will be a product of a term from the first binomial expansion and a term from the second binomial expansion.\n\nBut since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), we can actually treat the second part as a constant with respect to \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). Wait, no, that's not quite right. Because when we multiply, each term in the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) will be the sum over all possible terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any term from the second expansion. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), we can just take the coefficient from the first part and multiply it by the entire second expansion. Wait, but that would be incorrect because we're supposed to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, which includes all possible combinations of \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\), and \\(1/c\\).\n\nWait, no, actually, when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficients of the terms multiply. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, each term contributes a multiple of \\(a^2b^2\\) times something involving \\(c\\), but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), the total coefficient will be the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part.\n\nWait, let me think again. If I have two polynomials, \\(P(a, b)\\) and \\(Q(c)\\), then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\(P(a, b) \\times Q(c)\\) is indeed the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(P(a, b)\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(Q(c)\\), because each term in \\(Q(c)\\) is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), and the coefficients add up.\n\nBut in this case, \\(Q(c)\\) is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the sum of all coefficients in \\(Q(c)\\) is obtained by setting \\(c = 1\\). Because when \\(c = 1\\), each term becomes just the coefficient, so the sum is \\(Q(1) = (1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\).\n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. Because another approach is to consider that when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficients multiply, but in this case, since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), the coefficient is indeed the product of the coefficients from each part, because each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, and the only term that contributes to \\(a^2b^2\\) is the term with \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part multiplied by any term from the second part. Therefore, the total coefficient is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\nAlternatively, I can think of it as the coefficient being the product of the coefficients from each part, because the variables are independent. So, yes, I think this is correct.\n\nWait, but let me check another way. Let's expand both parts and see.\n\nFirst, \\((a + b)^4\\) has the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) as we found.\n\nNow, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) can be expanded as \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\).\n\nEach term in this expansion is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\).\n\nNow, when we multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, resulting in terms like \\(6a^2b^2 \\times \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\).\n\nSince we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), the total coefficient is the sum of all the coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by 6. Because each term in the second expansion contributes a coefficient when multiplied by \\(6a^2b^2\\).\n\nSo, the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion is indeed \\(Q(1) = (1 + 1)^6 = 64\\), as I thought earlier. Therefore, the total coefficient is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\nWait, but let me make sure that's correct. Another way to think about it is that when you have two polynomials multiplied together, the coefficient of a specific term in one polynomial is multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the other polynomial to get the coefficient of that specific term in the product.\n\nYes, that makes sense because each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial, so the specific term's coefficient is multiplied by every possible coefficient from the second polynomial, and since we're summing over all those products, it's equivalent to multiplying by the sum of the coefficients.\n\nTherefore, I'm confident that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 384.\n\nWait, but just to be absolutely sure, let me compute the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion another way. The sum of the coefficients is when \\(c = 1\\), so \\(\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). Yep, that's correct.\n\nSo, the coefficient from the first part is 6, and the sum of coefficients from the second part is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nI think that's the correct answer. Let me just recap to make sure I didn't miss anything.\n\n1. Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6.\n2. The second part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), when expanded, has terms with various powers of \\(c\\). The sum of all coefficients in this expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives 64.\n3. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nYes, that seems right. I don't think I made any mistakes in the calculations. The key insight was recognizing that the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion is 64, which when multiplied by the coefficient from the first expansion gives the desired result.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{384}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem and consider the contributions from each part separately.\n\n1. **Expanding \\((a + b)^4\\):**\n   Using the binomial theorem, the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is:\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k} b^k\n   \\]\n   We need the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2. This occurs when \\(k = 2\\):\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} a^2 b^2 = 6a^2b^2\n   \\]\n   Thus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\n2. **Considering \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   The expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem is:\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n   \\]\n   The sum of all coefficients in this expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\):\n   \\[\n   \\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\n   \\]\n\n3. **Combining the results:**\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the product of the coefficient from the first part and the sum of the coefficients from the second part:\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 64 = 384\n   \\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{384}."

    "text": " I'm a bit confused because there are two variables here, \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\), but I think the key is to look at each part separately and then combine them.\n\nFirst, I remember that when expanding expressions like \\((a + b)^n\\), we can use the binomial theorem. The binomial theorem says that \\((a + b)^n = \\sum_{k=0}^{n} \\dbinom{n}{k} a^{n - k} b^{k}\\). So, in this case, for \\((a + b)^4\\), the expansion will have terms from \\(a^4\\) down to \\(b^4\\).\n\nSince the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I need to find the term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2. Let me write that out. The general term in the expansion is \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k} b^{k}\\). So, if \\(4 - k = 2\\), then \\(k = 2\\). That means the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\).\n\nCalculating that, \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) is \\(\\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\nNow, the other part of the expression is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I'm not sure how this part interacts with the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. Wait, maybe I need to consider the entire product. So, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\). That makes me think that the coefficient might just be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but since we're only interested in \\(a^2b^2\\), perhaps the \\(c\\) terms don't affect it.\n\nWait, no. Actually, when you multiply two expressions together, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression. But since we're only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), that means we only need the constant term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because any term with \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\) would create a term with \\(a^2b^2c\\) or \\(a^2b^2/c\\), which aren't just \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient we want is 6 times the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nOkay, so now I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Again, I can use the binomial theorem here. The expansion is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\).\n\nWe need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero because that's the constant term. So, set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). The constant term is then \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\).\n\nCalculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\) is \\(\\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). Wait, no, that's not right. Let me check that calculation again. \\(6! = 720\\), \\(3! = 6\\), so \\(\\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). Yeah, that's correct. So, the constant term is 20.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 (from the \\(a + b\\) part) multiplied by 20 (the constant term from the \\(c + 1/c\\) part). So, 6 times 20 is 120.\n\nWait a second, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake. So, in the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6. Then, in the second part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the constant term is 20. So, when you multiply these two expressions together, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But since we're only interested in the term that has \\(a^2b^2\\), and not any \\(c\\) terms, we only consider the constant term from the second expansion. So, 6 times 20 is 120. That seems right.\n\nI don't think I made any mistakes here. So, the coefficient should be 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplying it by the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20. Thus, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{120}\n\\]"

    "text": " I'm a bit confused, but I'll take it slow.\n\nFirst, I remember that when you expand a binomial like \\((a + b)^n\\), you can use the binomial theorem. The binomial theorem says that each term in the expansion is of the form \\(\\dbinom{n}{k} a^{n - k} b^k\\), where \\(\\dbinom{n}{k}\\) is the binomial coefficient, which can be found using combinations. So, maybe I can apply that here.\n\nThe expression has two parts: \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). I notice that \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are only in the first part, so maybe I don't need to worry about the second part for this term. Wait, but the second part is multiplied by the first, so actually, I might need to consider how the terms interact when multiplied together. Hmm, maybe not. Let me think.\n\nWait, no, because \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are only in the first binomial, and \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) are only in the second. So when I multiply them together, the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms come from the first part, and the \\(c\\) terms come from the second. So, if I'm looking for a term that's \\(a^2b^2\\), it's only going to come from the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\). The \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) part will contribute some power of \\(c\\), but since we're only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), maybe the value of the exponent on \\(c\\) doesn't matter, or perhaps it's just a constant multiplier. Wait, but I think the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, maybe I can just find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and then multiply it by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but that seems complicated. Alternatively, perhaps the \\(c\\) terms don't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms when multiplying, so maybe I can treat them separately.\n\nWait, let me check that. If I have \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), when I expand both, each term in the expansion of the first will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of the second. So, for example, a term like \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion will be multiplied by terms like \\(c^6\\), \\(c^4\\), etc., from the second expansion. But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), perhaps it's considering all possible products where the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) parts are \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) part. But that seems a bit odd because \\(a^2b^2\\) would then be multiplied by various powers of \\(c\\), so the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually be \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some \\(k\\), but the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which might mean they're treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable and not considering it, or perhaps they just want the coefficient regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating this.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, perhaps I can compute the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and then, since the other part is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is being multiplied, the coefficient would be the product of the coefficients from both parts. But wait, that doesn't make sense because the \\(c\\) part doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be the same as in \\((a + b)^4\\), multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which seems unlikely because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, which includes all possible terms from both binomials. But since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are only in the first part, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term would only come from the first binomial, and the second binomial would contribute a term that's a power of \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, not a single number. Hmm, that seems confusing.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in other words, when you multiply out the entire expression, you'll have terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for various \\(k\\), and the coefficient for each such term would be the product of the coefficients from each binomial. But the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would then be the sum of all coefficients from the second binomial multiplied by the coefficient from the first binomial for \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, that might make sense.\n\nLet me try to break it down:\n\n1. First, find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\).\n\n2. Then, find the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), because when you multiply by each term from the second binomial, each will contribute a factor that multiplies the coefficient from the first binomial.\n\nWait, but that might not be correct because each term in the second binomial has a specific power of \\(c\\), so when you multiply, you get terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), etc. But the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would mean considering all terms where the variables are \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) part. So, in that case, the coefficient would be the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients from the second part.\n\nWait, but the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, perhaps the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the coefficient from the first part times 64.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\), ignoring the \\(c\\) part. But that seems unlikely because the problem includes both parts.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let's see. Let me compute the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) first.\n\nUsing the binomial theorem, the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^4 \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k} b^k\\). So, the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) occurs is when \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). So, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\).\n\nCalculating that, \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\\).\n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\nNow, since the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), when we expand this, each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second part, which are of the form \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\times (1/c)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\).\n\nSo, the coefficient for each such term would be 6 (from the first part) multiplied by \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}\\) (from the second part). But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is in the product, we need to consider all the terms where the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) parts are \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the sum of all the products of the coefficients from the second binomial multiplied by 6.\n\nWait, that seems a bit off. Let me think again. Each term in the product will be of the form \\(a^2b^2 \\times c^{6 - 2k}\\), where \\(k\\) ranges from 0 to 6. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^{6 - 2k}\\) would be 6 \\times \\dbinom{6}{k}. But if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then the coefficient would be the sum over all \\(k\\) of \\(6 \\times \\dbinom{6}{k}\\). But that sum would be 6 times the sum of \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}\\) from \\(k=0\\) to \\(6\\), which is 6 times \\(2^6 = 64\\), so 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but that seems high. Let me check that again. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, meaning that the \\(c\\) terms are considered as separate variables, so the coefficient would just be 6, as in the first part. But that doesn't make sense because the entire expression is the product of both binomials, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would involve the product of the coefficients from both parts.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, considering all possible terms, so including the \\(c\\) terms. But in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times each of the coefficients from the second binomial, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) would be 6 \\times \\dbinom{6}{k} for each \\(k\\). But the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which might mean that it's considering all possible \\(c\\) terms, so the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients from the second binomial. Since the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is when \\(c = 1\\), which is \\(2^6 = 64\\), so the coefficient would be 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but that seems like a lot. Let me see if that makes sense. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and the \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) part is irrelevant because \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) don't appear there. But that seems unlikely because the problem includes both parts.\n\nWait, another approach: when you multiply two expressions, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each factor. So, if I'm looking for \\(a^2b^2\\), that term comes only from \\((a + b)^4\\), and the corresponding term from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) would be any term, since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\). But that doesn't make sense because \\(a^2b^2\\) is just a term from the first part, and when multiplied by the second part, each term in the second part would contribute a factor. So, perhaps the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is just the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, perhaps the problem is considering all variables together, so \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term, and the rest can have \\(c\\) terms, but the coefficient is the numerical factor in front of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for any \\(k\\). But the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so maybe it's considering all possible terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. In that case, the coefficient would be the sum over all \\(k\\) of the coefficients from each part.\n\nWait, that would mean the coefficient is 6 multiplied by the sum of the coefficients from the second binomial. The sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is indeed \\(2^6 = 64\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nBut let me check that again. If I expand \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. Then, the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) has terms like \\(c^6\\), \\(6c^4\\), \\(15c^2\\), \\(20\\), \\(15c^{-2}\\), \\(6c^{-4}\\), \\(c^{-6}\\). So, when I multiply 6 by each of these, I get terms like \\(6c^6\\), \\(36c^4\\), etc., each multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). But the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would require me to consider all these terms, so the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second binomial, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but that seems correct because when you multiply by each term, you're effectively scaling the coefficient by each of those terms. So, the total coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) across all possible \\(c\\) terms is 384.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it, and the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and the \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) part is just a distraction. But that seems unlikely because the problem includes both parts.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, which includes all variables. So, perhaps the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by various powers of \\(c\\), but the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would be the same as the coefficient in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but that's a bit confusing because it's not a single number.\n\nWait, maybe I'm approaching this wrong. Let me think about how the product works. When you multiply two expressions, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term from the second part, which are \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\\) for \\(k\\) from 0 to 6. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^{6 - 2k}\\) would be \\(6 \\times \\dbinom{6}{k}\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would be the sum of all these coefficients for each \\(k\\). Wait, but that would mean the coefficient is 6 times the sum of \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}\\) for \\(k=0\\) to 6, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but that seems correct. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 384.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and the rest is irrelevant. But that seems unlikely because the problem includes both binomials.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me try another approach. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\). So, perhaps in the entire product, the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms is when the second binomial contributes a term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, i.e., when \\(c^0 = 1\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\).\n\nSo, first, find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6.\n\nNext, find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem, the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero occurs when \\(6 - k = k\\), so \\(6 - k = k\\) implies \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, that makes more sense. Because if we're looking for the term \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms, then we need to multiply by the term from the second binomial that gives \\(c^0\\), which is 20. So, the coefficient would be 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was 384, but that was considering all possible \\(c\\) terms. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which might imply that it's looking for the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. But in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients from the second binomial, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nBut now I'm confused because I have two different answers depending on how I interpret the problem. Let me check again.\n\nIf the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, considering all possible powers of \\(c\\), then the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second binomial, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nBut if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\), then the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nBut the problem just says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", without specifying any power of \\(c\\). So, perhaps the intended interpretation is that it's considering all possible powers of \\(c\\), meaning that the coefficient is 384.\n\nWait, but that seems a bit odd because usually, when you're asked for the coefficient of a specific term in a product, you're considering all possible contributions from the other variables. So, in this case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would indeed be the sum of all coefficients from the second binomial multiplied by the coefficient from the first binomial.\n\nSo, to confirm, the coefficient from the first part is 6, and the sum of coefficients from the second part is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but when I first thought about it, I considered that the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by each term from the second binomial, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), etc. So, each of these terms would have a coefficient of 6 times the corresponding binomial coefficient. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which I think refers to all such terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present, regardless of the power of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient would be the sum of all these individual coefficients, which is 6 times the sum of the coefficients from the second binomial, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but that seems high, so maybe I made a mistake. Let me check the sum of the coefficients in the second binomial again. The sum is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), so \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\), which is correct. So, 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and the rest is irrelevant. But that seems unlikely because the problem includes both binomials.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me think of it as a product of two polynomials. Each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial. Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second polynomial, you're effectively scaling the coefficient by each of those terms. So, the total coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) across all possible products would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me think again. If I have two polynomials, \\(P(a, b)\\) and \\(Q(c)\\), then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(P(a, b) \\times Q(c)\\) would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(P(a, b)\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(Q(c)\\), because each term in \\(Q(c)\\) contributes a factor that multiplies the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. So, yes, that would be 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nBut earlier, I thought that the problem might be asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. So, which is it?\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is written as \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), and it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\). So, in that case, we need to find the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\), which would require the second binomial to contribute a term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. As I calculated earlier, that term has a coefficient of 20, so the total coefficient would be 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, that makes sense because if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms, then it's specifically looking for the term where \\(c^0\\) is present. So, the answer would be 120.\n\nWait, but the problem didn't specify any power of \\(c\\), just \\(a^2b^2\\). So, perhaps it's considering all possible powers of \\(c\\), meaning the coefficient would be 384.\n\nI'm confused now. Let me try to look for similar problems or think about how coefficients work in products.\n\nWhen you have a product of two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum of the products of the coefficients of corresponding terms in each polynomial. So, for example, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial times the coefficient of \\(c^k\\) in the second polynomial.\n\nBut if you're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), then you'd have to sum over all possible \\(k\\), which would give you the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial.\n\nSo, in this case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nBut if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it's 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second polynomial, which is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but the problem didn't specify any power of \\(c\\), so I think it's more likely that it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), which would be 384.\n\nWait, but let me think again. If I have the product \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), and I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), then I'm looking for all terms where the variables are \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, each such term would be \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), and the coefficient would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^k\\) in the second polynomial. Therefore, the total coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) across all \\(k\\) would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So, the coefficient is 384.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was 120, but that was when I was looking for \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). So, perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), which would be 384.\n\nWait, but let me confirm with an example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Let's compute the coefficient of \\(a^2b^0\\). In \\((a + b)^2\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) is 1. In \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^1\\), the sum of coefficients is \\(1 + 1 = 2\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) in the product would be 1 * 2 = 2. Alternatively, if I'm looking for \\(a^2c^0\\), the coefficient would be 1 * 1 = 1. So, depending on the interpretation, the answer could be different.\n\nIn our problem, since the problem doesn't specify any power of \\(c\\), I think it's more reasonable to assume that it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), which would be 384.\n\nWait, but I'm still not entirely sure. Maybe I should check a reference or think about how the problem is phrased. The problem says, \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" It doesn't specify any \\(c\\) term, so perhaps it's considering all possible \\(c\\) terms, meaning the coefficient is 384.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and the rest is just part of the expression. But that seems unlikely because the problem includes both binomials.\n\nWait, another way to think about it: the entire expression is a product, so the term \\(a^2b^2\\) can appear in the product only when multiplied by any term from the second binomial. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients from the second part, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, I think the answer is 384.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was 120 when considering only the \\(c^0\\) term. So, perhaps I need to clarify.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, meaning that it's considering all possible terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, each such term would be \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), and the coefficient would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^k\\) in the second binomial. Therefore, the total coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the sum over all \\(k\\) of 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^k\\) in the second binomial, which is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second binomial, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nWait, but I'm still a bit unsure because sometimes problems ask for the coefficient of a specific term without considering other variables, but in this case, since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), I think the intended interpretation is that the coefficient is 384.\n\nWait, let me think of it differently. If I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = (1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, the entire expression becomes \\((a + b)^4 * 64\\). Then, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in this would be 6 * 64 = 384. So, that makes sense.\n\nAlternatively, if I set \\(c = 1\\), I'm effectively summing all coefficients in the second binomial, and then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nYes, that seems to confirm it.\n\nSo, after all that thinking, I believe the coefficient is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6 using the binomial theorem. Then, since the problem doesn't specify any power of \\(c\\), we consider the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 64 when \\(c = 1\\). Multiplying these together gives \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\boxed{384}."

    "text": " I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of binomial expansions, but I'll take it slow.\n\nFirst, I know that when you have an expression like \\((a + b)^n\\), you can expand it using the binomial theorem. The binomial theorem says that each term in the expansion is of the form \\(\\dbinom{n}{k} a^{n - k}b^k\\) where \\(k\\) ranges from 0 to \\(n\\). So, maybe I can apply that here.\n\nLooking at the first part of the expression, which is \\((a + b)^4\\). Let me write out its expansion. Using the binomial theorem, each term would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\\) for \\(k = 0\\) to \\(4\\).\n\nI'm specifically looking for the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2, so that would be \\(a^2b^2\\). Let me find the coefficient for that term. So, in this case, \\(n = 4\\), and I want \\(a^{4 - k}b^k = a^2b^2\\), which implies that \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\).\n\nSo, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6.\n\nNow, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I need to consider the expansion of both parts. But wait, I'm only asked about the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). That term comes from the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), as we found. Now, the second part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I need to see how that interacts with the first part.\n\nWait, but actually, when you multiply two expressions together, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by every term in the expansion of the second part. But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that only involves \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the second part involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), which are different variables, I think that when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by any term from the second part, the resulting terms will have \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by some power of \\(c\\) and some power of \\(1/c\\). But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), perhaps we're supposed to consider the entire product, but only the terms where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2 each, regardless of what's happening with \\(c\\).\n\nWait, that might not make sense. Let me think again. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product. So, in other words, when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), you'll get terms that are products of terms from each expansion. But \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term from the second part, so each of those products will be \\(a^2b^2\\) times something involving \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. Wait, but that would mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, not an expression.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" Hmm, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). That is, when you expand the entire product, collect like terms, and look for the term where \\(a\\) is squared and \\(b\\) is squared, but \\(c\\) can be anything. Then, the coefficient would be the sum of all the coefficients from the second part, multiplied by 6.\n\nWait, that makes more sense. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by every term in the second expansion, so each of those will contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nWait, but the sum of all the coefficients in a polynomial is found by plugging in 1 for all variables. So, in this case, if I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) becomes \\((1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me check that again because I might be making a mistake. Alternatively, maybe I should think of the problem as finding the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times any power of \\(c\\), but since the problem doesn't specify anything about \\(c\\), perhaps it's just 6 times the entire expansion of the second part, which would mean the coefficient is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second part, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider that the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, so each term in the second expansion contributes to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. So, the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, that seems high, but let me verify. Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think again: when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum of the products of the coefficients of terms whose variables multiply to give that specific term.\n\nIn this case, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the first polynomial, as the second polynomial has no \\(a\\) or \\(b\\) terms. Therefore, when you multiply, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is just the coefficient from the first part, multiplied by the entire second polynomial. But since the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and the second polynomial is a factor, perhaps the coefficient is 6 times the entire second polynomial. But that can't be, because the coefficient should be a number, not a polynomial.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misinterpreting the problem. Maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some specific \\(k\\), but it's not specified. Wait, no, the problem just says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", which suggests that it's considering terms where \\(a\\) is squared and \\(b\\) is squared, regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, because each term in the second expansion is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), contributing to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times that term's variables.\n\nWait, but if that's the case, then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would indeed be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is expecting a different approach. Let me try another way. Let me expand both expressions separately and then multiply them, looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\).\n\nFirst, expanding \\((a + b)^4\\) gives:\n\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\n\\]\n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6, as I found earlier.\n\nNow, expanding \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem gives:\n\n\\[\n\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n\\]\n\nSo, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\) for \\(k = 0\\) to \\(6\\).\n\nNow, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, resulting in terms like \\(6a^2b^2 \\times \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, each of these terms will have \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by some power of \\(c\\), but the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the sum of all these coefficients, regardless of the power of \\(c\\).\n\nWait, but that's essentially 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in the second expansion, because each term in the second expansion contributes its coefficient when multiplied by \\(6a^2b^2\\). So, the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion is when \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but that seems too straightforward, and I might be missing something. Let me check with a different approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\), i.e., a constant term with respect to \\(c\\). That would make more sense, as then we'd have to find the coefficient where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by the constant term in the second expansion.\n\nWait, that's a different problem. The original problem didn't specify anything about \\(c\\), so I'm not sure. Let me see: if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then it's 6 times the sum of coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6*64=384. But if it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then we need to find the constant term in the second expansion and multiply it by 6.\n\nWait, let me check that. The constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. So, in the expansion, each term is \\(c^{6 - 2k}\\), so setting \\(6 - 2k = 0\\) gives \\(k = 3\\). So, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) would be 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but the problem didn't specify anything about \\(c\\), so I'm confused. It just says the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, perhaps the problem is indeed asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), which would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6*64=384. Alternatively, maybe it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be 120.\n\nWait, perhaps I should read the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" Hmm, the way it's written, it's just \\(a^2b^2\\), without any mention of \\(c\\). So, perhaps it's considering the entire product, and we're to collect all terms where \\(a\\) is squared and \\(b\\) is squared, regardless of the power of \\(c\\). In that case, each such term would be \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by some term from the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6*64=384.\n\nWait, but that seems a bit off because usually, when you're asked for the coefficient of a specific term, you might be considering only the term where the exponents match exactly, but in this case, since the second part involves \\(c\\), which is a different variable, perhaps it's just the coefficient from the first part, 6, multiplied by the entire second expansion, but that doesn't make sense because the coefficient should be a number.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it, and the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating the entire expression as a product, so the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of the second part, but that doesn't make sense because the coefficient should be a scalar, not a polynomial.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to consider that the entire expression is a product, so when you multiply out, each term is a product of a term from the first expansion and a term from the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, resulting in terms like \\(6a^2b^2 \\times \\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, each of these terms will have \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by some power of \\(c\\), but the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the sum of all the coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by 6. Therefore, the coefficient is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6*64=384.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is expecting me to consider that the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, so the coefficient would be 6 times each term in the second expansion. But that would mean the coefficient isn't a single number, which doesn't make sense. So, perhaps the correct interpretation is that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), which would indeed be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, so 6*64=384.\n\nWait, but let me check with a different approach. Let me consider that the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). If I set \\(c = 1\\), then the second part becomes \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, the entire expression becomes \\((a + b)^4 \\times 64\\). Then, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in this would be 6 * 64 = 384, which matches what I found earlier.\n\nAlternatively, if I set \\(c = t\\), then the expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times (t + 1/t)^6\\). The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would then be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in \\((t + 1/t)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but another way to think about it is that when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum of the products of the coefficients of terms whose variables multiply to give that specific term. In this case, since the first polynomial has \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the second has \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), the variables don't interfere with each other. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial. So, that's 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but maybe I'm making a mistake here. Let me think again: the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the sum over all terms where the product of terms from each polynomial gives \\(a^2b^2\\). Since the second polynomial only has \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), which don't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), the only contribution to \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial multiplied by every term in the second polynomial. Therefore, the coefficient is indeed 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but another approach: perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\). That would be a specific term. In that case, the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion, which is 20, as I found earlier. So, 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nBut the problem didn't specify \\(c^0\\), so I'm not sure. Let me see which interpretation makes more sense.\n\nIf I consider the problem as asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then it's 384. If it's asking for \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it's 120.\n\nWait, but looking back at the problem statement: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" The way it's written, it's just \\(a^2b^2\\), without any mention of \\(c\\). So, perhaps the intended interpretation is that it's considering all terms where \\(a\\) is squared and \\(b\\) is squared, regardless of the power of \\(c\\). In that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6*64=384.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting me to consider that the entire expression is a product, and when you expand it, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the entire expansion of the second part, but that can't be because the coefficient should be a number.\n\nWait, but perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and then considering that the second part is multiplied by it, so the coefficient remains 6. But that doesn't seem right because the second part is a separate polynomial, so the coefficients in the product would be products of coefficients from each part.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me try a concrete example. Let's say I have two expressions: \\( (a + b)^2 \\) and \\( (c + 1/c)^1 \\). The expansion of \\( (a + b)^2 \\) is \\( a^2 + 2ab + b^2 \\), and the expansion of \\( (c + 1/c)^1 \\) is \\( c + 1/c \\). Now, multiplying these together, the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) would be 1 times the sum of coefficients in the second expansion, which is 1*(1 + 1) = 2. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) in the product would be 2. Similarly, the coefficient of \\(ab\\) would be 2 times the sum of coefficients in the second expansion, which is 2*2=4, so 4. And the coefficient of \\(b^2\\) would be 1*2=2.\n\nSo, applying that logic to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6*64=384.\n\nWait, but in my small example, the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) is 1 times the sum of coefficients in the second expansion, which is 2, so 2. Similarly, for \\(ab\\), it's 2*2=4, and for \\(b^2\\), it's 1*2=2. So, this seems to hold.\n\nTherefore, applying this to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the sum of coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6*64=384.\n\nWait, but another way to think about it is that when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a term in the product is the sum of the products of the coefficients of terms whose variables multiply to give that term. In this case, since the second polynomial doesn't have any \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial. So, that's 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nI think that's the correct approach. So, the coefficient is 384.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought maybe it's 120 if we're considering the constant term in the second expansion. But given that the problem didn't specify anything about \\(c\\), I think the correct interpretation is that it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), so it's 384.\n\nWait, but let me just confirm with another example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^1 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). The expansion would be \\((a + b)(c + 1/c)\\). The coefficient of \\(a\\) in this product would be 1 times the sum of coefficients in the second expansion, which is 1*(1 + 1)=2, so 2. Similarly, the coefficient of \\(b\\) would be 1*2=2. So, in this case, the coefficients of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2, which makes sense because each is multiplied by the entire second expansion.\n\nSo, applying this to our original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the sum of coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6*64=384.\n\nTherefore, I think the correct answer is 384.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{384}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem for both parts of the expression.\n\n1. **Expanding \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\):\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\n   \\]\n   So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\n2. **Considering the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n   \\]\n   The sum of all coefficients in this expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\):\n   \\[\n   \\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\n   \\]\n\n3. **Combining the results:**\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part:\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 64 = 384\n   \\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{384}."

    "text": " \n\nFirst, I remember that when you have an expression like \\((x + y)^n\\), you can expand it using the binomial theorem. The binomial theorem says that each term in the expansion is of the form \\(\\dbinom{n}{k}x^{n - k}y^k\\), where \\(k\\) goes from 0 to \\(n\\). So maybe I can apply that here.\n\nLooking at the given expression, it's a product of two binomials raised to different powers: \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, but \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are only in the first part of the product, right? The second part involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), so maybe the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from those involving \\(c\\). So, perhaps I can handle each part separately.\n\nLet me focus first on \\((a + b)^4\\). I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in this expansion. Using the binomial theorem, the general term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}a^{4 - k}b^k\\). I want the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2. That means \\(4 - k = 2\\), so \\(k = 2\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). \n\nCalculating that, \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\nNow, since the original expression is \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first part will be multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. But wait, the problem only asks for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\). So, perhaps the coefficient in the product will just be the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Wait, no, that's not quite right.\n\nWait, no, actually, when you multiply two expressions together, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients in the second part, because each term in the second part contributes a coefficient that, when multiplied by 6, will affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\).\n\nWait, but that doesn't sound quite correct. Let me think again. Actually, the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), when expanded, will have terms involving various powers of \\(c\\), but since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, each term contributes its coefficient times \\(a^2b^2\\), so the total coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) across all terms would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion.\n\nWait, but is that the case? Let me verify. Let me denote \\(A = (a + b)^4\\) and \\(B = \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Then the product is \\(A \\times B\\). If I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), that term comes from the product of the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(A\\) and every term in \\(B\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(A \\times B\\) would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(A\\) (which is 6) multiplied by the sum of the coefficients of all terms in \\(B\\), because each term in \\(B\\) has a coefficient that, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), contributes to the overall coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product.\n\nWait, but that seems a bit off because \\(B\\) has terms with different powers of \\(c\\), but \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), so actually, when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in \\(B\\), each of those terms will contribute a term like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2c^{-k}\\), but the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would only come from the term in \\(B\\) where the coefficient is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms. Wait, but that's not possible because \\(B\\) doesn't have a constant term (i.e., a term with \\(c^0\\)), does it?\n\nWait, let me check. The expression \\(B = \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem, the general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - k}\\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, the exponents of \\(c\\) will be \\(6 - 2k\\), where \\(k\\) ranges from 0 to 6. So, possible exponents are 6, 4, 2, 0, -2, -4, -6. Wait, so when \\(k = 3\\), the exponent is \\(6 - 6 = 0\\). So, there is a constant term in \\(B\\), which is when \\(k = 3\\), so the term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}c^0 = 20\\). Therefore, the constant term is 20.\n\nWait, so if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\(A \\times B\\), it's the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(A\\) times the constant term in \\(B\\), because only the constant term in \\(B\\) will multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) to give a term with \\(a^2b^2\\) alone, without any \\(c\\) terms. So, that would be 6 (from \\(A\\)) multiplied by 20 (the constant term in \\(B\\)), giving 120.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. So, in \\(A \\times B\\), each term is \\(a^kb^{4 - k}\\) from \\(A\\) multiplied by \\(c^{6 - 2m}\\) from \\(B\\), where \\(m\\) is from 0 to 6. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\(k = 2\\) in \\(A\\), and the term \\(c^0\\) in \\(B\\), which is when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), so \\(m = 3\\). So, the coefficient would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} \\times \\dbinom{6}{3}\\), which is 6 times 20, which is 120.\n\nWait, that makes sense. So, the coefficient is 120. Let me just go through it again to make sure I didn't skip any steps or make any errors.\n\nFirst, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n\nNext, in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the constant term (i.e., the term where \\(c^0\\)) occurs when the exponent is 0. As I found earlier, that happens when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), so \\(m = 3\\). The coefficient for this term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n\nTherefore, when you multiply the two expansions together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from \\(A\\) will be multiplied by the constant term 20 from \\(B\\), resulting in a term \\(6 \\times 20 \\times a^2b^2 = 120a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient is 120.\n\nWait, but let me check if I considered all possibilities correctly. Is there any other term in \\(B\\) that could contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product? For example, could a term with \\(c^k\\) and another term with \\(c^{-k}\\) multiply to give a constant term? But no, because each term in \\(B\\) is either \\(c^k\\) or \\(c^{-k}\\), so when you multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), each term in \\(B\\) would give a term like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2c^{-k}\\). The only way to get a term with just \\(a^2b^2\\) is if the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, which only happens once, when \\(k = 3\\). So, the only contribution to \\(a^2b^2\\) is from the constant term in \\(B\\), which is 20. Therefore, the total coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nI think that's correct. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem for each part separately.\n\n1. **Expanding \\((a + b)^4\\):**\n   Using the binomial theorem, the general term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}a^{4 - k}b^k\\).

The coefficient is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\n   \\]\n\n2. **Expanding \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   Using the binomial theorem, the general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\).

The coefficient is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\n   \\]\n\n3. **Combining the results:**\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is the product of the coefficients found above:\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 20 = 120\n   \\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

I notice that the term we're looking for is \\(a^2b^2\\), which is part of the first binomial expansion. The second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), so maybe I don't need to worry about that part when looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, but actually, I think the entire expression is multiplied together, so maybe the coefficients from both expansions will multiply as well. Hmm, I'm not sure yet. Let me think.\n\nSo, first, let me focus on expanding \\((a + b)^4\\).

So, \\(a^2b^2\\) would correspond to \\(k = 2\\) in the expansion because \\(4 - k = 2\\) implies \\(k = 2\\).

So, the term is \\(6a^2b^2\\).\n\nNow, the other part of the expression is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me expand that as well using the binomial theorem:\n\n\\[\n\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\n\\]\n\nSimplifying each term, \\(\\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = c^{-m}\\), so each term becomes:\n\n\\[\n\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m} = \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n\\]\n\nSo, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\).\n\nNow, since the original problem is the product of these two expansions, \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the entire expression becomes:\n\n\\[\n\\left( \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k} b^k \\right) \\times \\left( \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m} \\right)\n\\]\n\nWhen you multiply two sums, you get a double sum:\n\n\\[\n\\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{4}{k} \\dbinom{6}{m} a^{4 - k} b^k c^{6 - 2m}\n\\]\n\nBut in this problem, we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). That means we need to find all terms in the product where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2 each. So, looking at \\(a^{4 - k}b^k\\), we set \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\), which gives \\(k = 2\\) as before.\n\nNow, since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the exponent of \\(c\\) in the term \\(c^{6 - 2m}\\) can be anything because we're only concerned with the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\).

Actually, each term in the product will have a specific power of \\(c\\), but since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), we need to sum over all possible \\(m\\) values that contribute to the \\(a^2b^2\\) term.\n\nWait, no. Let me clarify: When we multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in the expansion will be a product of a term from the first expansion and a term from the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion will be multiplied by every term in the second expansion.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating.\n\nWait, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is just the coefficient from the first expansion times the entire second expansion, because \\(a^2b^2\\) is independent of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be \\(6 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that can't be right because we're being asked for a numerical coefficient, not an expression involving \\(c\\). So, maybe I misunderstood the problem. Wait, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, which would involve summing over all possible terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any power of \\(c\\). But that doesn't make sense because \\(a^2b^2\\) is separate from \\(c\\). Wait, no, perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), which would mean that the coefficient is the same as in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that also doesn't make sense because each term in the product is \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by some term in the second expansion. Wait, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times any power of \\(c\\), so the coefficient would be \\(6\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which would be \\(6 \\times 2^6 = 6 \\times 64 = 384\\). But that seems too high, and I'm not sure if that's the right approach.\n\nWait, let me think again. The original expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by every term in the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would mean that the coefficient is \\(6 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial in \\(c\\), not a numerical coefficient. So, perhaps I'm misinterpreting the problem. Maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of the power of \\(c\\), which would mean that the coefficient is \\(6\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). The sum of coefficients in a polynomial is found by setting all variables to 1. So, setting \\(c = 1\\), the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). But I'm not sure if that's correct because the problem might actually be asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some specific \\(k\\), but it's not specified. Wait, the problem just says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", which is a bit ambiguous because in the product, each term will have both \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) parts and \\(c\\) parts. So, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), which would mean that we're treating \\(c\\) as an independent variable and summing over all possible powers. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) as separate variables, and the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be a polynomial in \\(c\\). But I think the problem is more likely asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, which would be a sum over all possible \\(c\\) terms, so the coefficient would be \\(6 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but that's not a numerical coefficient.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me go back. The problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the same as in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would mean that the coefficient is \\(6 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for a coefficient, which is a number, not an expression. So, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable, so the coefficient would be \\(6 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but that's not a number. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), i.e., the constant term with respect to \\(c\\). That would make more sense because then we'd have a numerical coefficient.\n\nSo, if that's the case, then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). That seems plausible.\n\nSo, let's proceed under that assumption. So, first, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, as we found earlier.\n\nNext, we need the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Let's find that.\n\nExpanding \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem:\n\n\\[\n\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n\\]\n\nWe want the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so:\n\n\\[\n6 - 2m = 0 \\implies 2m = 6 \\implies m = 3\n\\]\n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\).\n\nCalculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\).\n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 20.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nWait, but the problem didn't specify anything about \\(c\\), just asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, maybe I'm overcomplicating again. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of the power of \\(c\\). In that case, the coefficient would be \\(6 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but that's a polynomial, not a number. So, maybe the problem is intended to ask for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable, which would mean that the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But since the problem didn't specify, perhaps the intended answer is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which would be \\(6 \\times 2^6 = 6 \\times 64 = 384\\), as I thought earlier.\n\nWait, but let's check that. The sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). So, if I multiply that by 6, I get 384. But I'm not sure if that's the right approach because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not the sum of coefficients. So, perhaps the correct approach is that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is \\(6 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but that seems odd because it's not a numerical coefficient.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to ask for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, which would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, not a number. Therefore, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\), which is 1. In that case, the coefficient would be 6 times 20, which is 120.\n\nWait, but the problem didn't specify \\(c^0\\), so maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me check the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, it's just \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the entire second part. So, the coefficient would be \\(6 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but that's a polynomial, not a number. So, perhaps the problem is intended to ask for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, which is a polynomial, so the coefficient is \\(6 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that seems odd because usually, when asked for a coefficient, it's a number, not a polynomial. Therefore, perhaps the problem is miswritten, or perhaps I'm misunderstanding it.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\). In that case, the coefficient would be 6 times 20, which is 120. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, which would be the same as 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 times 64, which is 384.\n\nWait, but let's think about this differently. The entire product is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). If we expand this, each term will be of the form \\(a^{4 - k}b^k c^{6 - 2m}\\), where \\(k\\) and \\(m\\) range from 0 to 4 and 0 to 6, respectively. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) occurs when \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\), as before. For each such term, the exponent of \\(c\\) is \\(6 - 2m\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the sum over all \\(m\\) of the coefficients from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) multiplied by 6, the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(6 \\times \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m}\\), but that sum is \\(6 \\times 2^6 = 6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\nWait, but that can't be right because each term in the product is \\(a^{4 - k}b^k c^{6 - 2m}\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(6\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is indeed \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). So, maybe that's the answer. But I'm a bit confused because I'm not sure if the problem wants the coefficient regardless of the power of \\(c\\), which would be 384, or if it wants the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be 120.\n\nWait, let me think again. The problem says: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" Since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will appear in the product multiplied by every possible term from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is \\(6 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial, not a number. So, perhaps the problem is intended to ask for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable, so the coefficient is \\(6 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that seems odd because the problem is asking for a coefficient, which is typically a number.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, which is a polynomial in \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\), so the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\). But since the problem didn't specify, perhaps the intended answer is 384, which is the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) multiplied by 6. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be 120.\n\nWait, let me check an example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Expanding this, we get:\n\n\\[\n(a + b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2\n\\]\n\\[\n(c + 1/c) = c + 1/c\n\\]\nMultiplying them together:\n\\[\n(a^2 + 2ab + b^2)(c + 1/c) = a^2c + a^2/c + 2ab c + 2ab/c + b^2c + b^2/c\n\\]\nSo, the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) is \\(c + 1/c\\), the coefficient of \\(2ab\\) is \\(c + 1/c\\), and the coefficient of \\(b^2\\) is \\(c + 1/c\\). So, in this case, the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) is a polynomial in \\(c\\), not a number. Therefore, perhaps the problem is intended to ask for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) as a polynomial in \\(c\\), which would be \\(6 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that seems too involved, and I'm not sure if that's what the problem is asking.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be a number. So, in that case, as we calculated earlier, it's 120.\n\nWait, let me go back to the problem statement: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" It doesn't mention \\(c\\), so perhaps it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), which would be the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by 6. So, that would be \\(6 \\times 2^6 = 6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\nWait, but in the example I did earlier with \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) is \\(c + 1/c\\), which is a polynomial. So, perhaps in the given problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(6 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial, but the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, which suggests that perhaps the problem is intended to ask for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to ask for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, regardless of \\(c\\), which would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 times 64, which is 384.\n\nWait, but let's think about it differently. When you multiply two polynomials, each term in the product is a term from the first polynomial times a term from the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first polynomial will be multiplied by every term in the second polynomial. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is \\(6\\) times the entire second polynomial, which is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial, not a number. Therefore, if the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, it must be asking for a specific term, such as \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some \\(k\\), but it's not specified.\n\nGiven that, perhaps the problem is intended to ask for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be a number. So, as we calculated earlier, the coefficient is 120.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable, so the coefficient is \\(6 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But since the problem didn't specify, I'm not sure.\n\nWait, perhaps I can think of it another way. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial. Therefore, if the problem is asking for the coefficient as a polynomial, that's the answer. But if it's asking for a numerical coefficient, perhaps it's referring to the constant term with respect to \\(c\\), which would be \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nWait, I'm getting confused. Let me try to look for a different approach. Maybe I can treat \\(c\\) as a separate variable and realize that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is a polynomial in \\(c\\). So, the answer would be \\(6 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that seems too involved, and the problem is likely expecting a numerical answer.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is a typo, and it's supposed to be \\((a + b + c + 1/c)^4\\) or something similar, but that's just speculation.\n\nWait, another thought: Maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\). In that case, as we calculated earlier, the coefficient would be 120.\n\nGiven that, perhaps the intended answer is 120.\n\nWait, let me confirm. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is \\(6 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). If we want the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), we need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 20, so the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nYes, that makes sense. So, the problem is likely asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, considering only the constant term with respect to \\(c\\), is 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break down the problem using the binomial theorem.\n\nFirst, consider the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k} b^k\n\\]\nWe are interested in the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2.

    "text": " \n\nFirst, I remember that when expanding expressions like \\((a + b)^n\\), we can use the binomial theorem. The binomial theorem states that \\((a + b)^n = \\sum_{k=0}^{n} \\dbinom{n}{k} a^{n - k}b^{k}\\). So, maybe I can apply this to both parts of the given expression separately.\n\nLet me start with the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\). Using the binomial theorem, this would expand to:\n\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^{k}\n\\]\n\nI'm specifically looking for the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2, so that would be when \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). Let me compute the binomial coefficient for this term:\n\n\\[\n\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\n\\]\n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. \n\nNow, moving on to the second part of the expression, which is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Again, I can use the binomial theorem here:\n\n\\[\n\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\n\\]\n\nSimplifying the exponents, this becomes:\n\n\\[\n\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m - m} = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n\\]\n\nSo, each term in this expansion is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). \n\nNow, since the original problem is the product of \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), I need to consider how these two expansions multiply together. \n\nBut wait, I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). That means I don't need to consider terms in the second expansion that involve \\(c\\) because \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\). So, actually, when I multiply the two expressions, the terms involving \\(c\\) will multiply with the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), but since I'm only looking for \\(a^2b^2\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by the entire second expansion, but since \\(a^2b^2\\) is independent of \\(c\\), perhaps I don't need to worry about the \\(c\\) terms?\n\nWait, no, that doesn't make sense. Let me think again. The entire expression is the product of two expansions. So, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. \n\nBut since I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), I need to find the part of the product where the \\(c\\) terms cancel out, leaving only \\(a^2b^2\\). \n\nWait, but \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term without \\(c\\), so when I multiply by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which has terms with various powers of \\(c\\), the only way to get a term without \\(c\\) is to multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nSo, first, let me find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nLooking at the expansion, the general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). I want the exponent of \\(c\\) to be zero because that's the constant term. So, I set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\):\n\n\\[\n6 - 2m = 0 \\implies 2m = 6 \\implies m = 3\n\\]\n\nSo, the constant term is when \\(m = 3\\):\n\n\\[\n\\dbinom{6}{3} c^{0} = \\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the constant term is 20. \n\nSo, now, going back to the original product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from \\((a + b)^4\\) has a coefficient of 6, and it's multiplied by the constant term 20 from the second expansion. \n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nWait, let me just make sure I didn't make a mistake here. So, the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the constant term from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 20, so when I multiply these two, the coefficient becomes 120. \n\nIs there any other term that could contribute to \\(a^2b^2\\)? Hmm, no, because any term involving \\(c\\) would have a power of \\(c\\), and since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't have any \\(c\\), only the constant term from the second expansion would multiply with \\(a^2b^2\\) without introducing any \\(c\\) terms. \n\nSo, I think that's correct.

    "text": " \n\nFirst, I remember that when expanding expressions like \\((a + b)^n\\), we can use the binomial theorem. The binomial theorem states that \\((a + b)^n = \\sum_{k=0}^{n} \\dbinom{n}{k} a^{n - k}b^{k}\\). So, for \\((a + b)^4\\), the expansion would be \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^{k}\\).\n\nI'm specifically looking for the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2, which is \\(a^2b^2\\). So, I need to find the coefficient when \\(k = 2\\) in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\). Let me compute that.\n\nThe binomial coefficient for \\(k = 2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\nNow, the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I need to consider how this multiplication affects the coefficient. Wait, but actually, since I'm only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which comes from the \\((a + b)^4\\) part, the other part \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) will contribute a term that doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\). So, maybe I just need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), and then multiply it by the coefficient 6 from the other part?\n\nWait, let me think again. Actually, when you multiply two polynomials, each term from the first polynomial gets multiplied by each term from the second polynomial. So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term from \\((a + b)^4\\), I need to find all terms in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) that don't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) parts. That is, the terms in the second part that are constants, because otherwise, multiplying by \\(a^2b^2\\) would introduce variables \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), which we don't want in the term \\(a^2b^2\\). So, I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nLet me verify that. If I have \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part, and I multiply it by a term from the second part, say \\(c^k\\) or \\(c^{-k}\\), then the resulting term would be \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2c^{-k}\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term without \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), the only contribution comes from the constant term in the second part. So, I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nAlright, so let's compute the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Again, using the binomial theorem, this is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying that, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m} = \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\).\n\nI need to find the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero because that's the constant term. So, set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\).\n\nSo, the constant term is when \\(m = 3\\), and the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). Wait, that's not correct. Wait, 6! is 720, 3! is 6, so 720 / (6 * 6) is 720 / 36 = 20. Hmm, but actually, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\) is 20, yes. So, the constant term is 20.\n\nTherefore, the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. So, when we multiply the two parts together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the constant term from the other part, which is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the constant term in the second part is 20, so 6 * 20 is indeed 120. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120.\n\nWait, but hold on a second. Let me just verify that I didn't overlook anything. So, the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product of \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are variables separate from \\(c\\), the only way to get a term with \\(a^2b^2\\) is to take \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part and multiply it by the constant term from the second part, which is 20. So, 6 * 20 is 120. That seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should think about it differently. If I consider the entire expression, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will come from the product of the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and any term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But since we're looking for \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms, the only contributing term is when we take \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part and the constant term from the second part. So, that's 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me think about how the multiplication works. Each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by every term in the second part, but only the constant term (i.e., the term with \\(c^0\\)) will result in a term that's just \\(a^2b^2\\). All other terms would have \\(c\\) raised to some power, so they would be \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or similar, which aren't \\(a^2b^2\\) alone. So, only the constant term from the second part contributes to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\).\n\nTherefore, the coefficient is indeed 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, let me double-check the binomial coefficients. For \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\), correct. For \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the constant term is when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), so \\(m = 3\\), and \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\), correct. So, 6 * 20 = 120. Yeah, that seems right.\n\nI think I've got it. The coefficient is 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem.\n\nFirst, consider the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^{k}\n\\]\nWe need the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2, which is \\(a^2b^2\\). This corresponds to \\(k = 2\\). The binomial coefficient for \\(k = 2\\) is:\n\\[\n\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\n\\]\nSo, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\nNext, we need to consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):\n\\[\n\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n\\]\nWe need the constant term, which occurs when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero.

The binomial coefficient for \\(m = 3\\) is:\n\\[\n\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\n\\]\nSo, the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20.\n\nFinally, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) and the constant term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):\n\\[\n6 \\times 20 = 120\n\\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}."

    "text": " I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of binomial expansions, but I think I can handle this.\n\nFirst, I remember that when you have an expression like \\((x + y)^n\\), you can expand it using the binomial theorem, which states that each term is of the form \\(\\dbinom{n}{k}x^{n - k}y^{k}\\). So, maybe I can apply this theorem to both parts of the given expression separately and then multiply the results.\n\nLet me break down the problem into two parts: expanding \\((a + b)^4\\) and expanding \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Then, I can find the specific terms I need from each expansion and multiply them together to get the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\).\n\nStarting with the first part: \\((a + b)^4\\). Using the binomial theorem, the expansion will be the sum from \\(k = 0\\) to \\(k = 4\\) of \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}a^{4 - k}b^{k}\\). I'm interested in the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2, so I need to find the term where \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). Let me compute that.\n\nSo, when \\(k = 2\\), the term is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}a^{2}b^{2}\\). The binomial coefficient \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) is calculated as \\(\\dfrac{4!}{2!(4 - 2)!} = \\dfrac{24}{2 \\times 2} = 6\\). So, the coefficient here is 6, and the term is \\(6a^2b^2\\).\n\nAlright, that takes care of the first part. Now, moving on to the second part: \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Again, using the binomial theorem, each term in this expansion will be \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - m}\\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^{m}\\), where \\(m\\) ranges from 0 to 6.\n\nLet me simplify each term. \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - m}\\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - m}c^{-m} = \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\).\n\nNow, I need to figure out which term in this expansion will contribute to the overall term \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, actually, when I multiply the two expansions together, I'll be combining terms from both. But since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) won't affect the terms involving \\(c\\). That means that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression will just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) from \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because the \\(c\\) terms don't interfere with the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms.\n\nWait, that doesn't seem right. Let me think again. No, actually, when you multiply two polynomials, each term from the first polynomial is multiplied by each term from the second polynomial. But in this case, the first polynomial is in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the second is in \\(c\\). So, the product will have terms like \\(a^kb^{4 - k}c^{6 - 2m}\\) and similar. But since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are different variables, the only way to get a term with \\(a^2b^2\\) is to take the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first expansion and multiply it by any term from the second expansion. However, since the second expansion is in \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), which are different variables, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion multiplied by the entire sum of the second expansion, because each term in the second expansion is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\).\n\nWait, no, that's not correct either. Because when you multiply two expressions, each term from the first is multiplied by each term from the second. So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Because each term in the second expansion is a constant or a term in \\(c\\), which doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) exponents.\n\nWait, let me clarify. The product is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, when you expand this, each term will be of the form \\(a^kb^{4 - k} \\times c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will come from the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6a^2b^2, and then it will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product will be 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion.\n\nWait, no, that's not correct because the second expansion doesn't have a constant term unless \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which happens when \\(m = 3\\). So, the term where \\(m = 3\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}c^{0} = 20\\). So, the only term that contributes to a constant (i.e., a term without \\(c\\)) is when \\(m = 3\\), which is 20. Therefore, when multiplying 6a^2b^2 by the second expansion, the only term that will result in a constant term (i.e., without any \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\)) is when we multiply by the constant term 20. So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which I think refers to the term \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, maybe I was wrong earlier. Let me think again.\n\nActually, when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion will be multiplied by every term in the second expansion, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^{6 - 2m}\\). Therefore, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, because each term in the second expansion contributes a coefficient that multiplies \\(a^2b^2\\).\n\nWait, but that's only if we are looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. But the problem statement is a bit ambiguous. It says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", which could mean the coefficient when considering all variables, but since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are separate, I think the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by any power of \\(c\\). But in reality, when you multiply the two expressions, the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from those involving \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient from the first expansion multiplied by the entire second expansion, but that doesn't make sense because the second expansion isn't a single coefficient.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me clarify: The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, in other words, we're looking for all terms in the expansion where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2 each, regardless of the exponents of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion multiplied by the entire second expansion, because each term in the second expansion will be multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^{6 - 2m}\\). Therefore, the coefficient for each such term is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by the coefficient from the second part.\n\nWait, but that would mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. But that doesn't seem right because the second expansion isn't a single term; it's a sum of terms with different powers of \\(c\\). So, perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient when considering the entire expression, meaning that \\(a^2b^2\\) can be multiplied by any power of \\(c\\), but the coefficient itself would be the product of the coefficients from both expansions.\n\nWait, no, that's not possible because the variables are separate. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is simply 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But that would mean that the coefficient is not a single number but a polynomial. But the problem is asking for a coefficient, which is a number, so perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where \\(a\\) is squared, \\(b\\) is squared, and \\(c\\) is to the zero power. That would make sense because otherwise, the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make much sense as a single coefficient.\n\nSo, if that's the case, then we need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product. That would mean that from the first expansion, we take the \\(a^2b^2\\) term, which has a coefficient of 6, and from the second expansion, we take the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, which is when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), so \\(m = 3\\). The coefficient for that term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then it would be 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which would result in a polynomial where each term is \\(6 \\times \\text{(coefficient from second expansion)} \\times a^2b^2c^{\\text{something}}\\). But since the problem just asks for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), without specifying \\(c\\), I think it's more likely that they want the coefficient when \\(c\\) is also raised to the zero power, making it a constant term. So, 120 would be the answer.\n\nWait, but let me make sure. Let me think of it another way. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). If I expand this, each term will be a product of a term from the first expansion and a term from the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first expansion with coefficient 6, and it's multiplied by each term from the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. But wait, the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\). So, substituting \\(c = 1\\) into \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but that contradicts my earlier conclusion. So, which is it? Is it 120 or 384? Let me think carefully.\n\nIf the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then yes, it would be 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, giving 384. But if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it's 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nBut the problem statement is: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\).\" It doesn't specify anything about \\(c\\), so I think the intended interpretation is that we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times any power of \\(c\\), which would mean that it's 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. Therefore, the coefficient would be 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but that seems a bit off because when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficients combine in a specific way. Let me think of a simpler example to test this. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Expanding this, we get \\((a^2 + 2ab + b^2)(c + 1/c)\\). The coefficient of \\(a^2\\) would be 1 (from \\(a^2\\)) multiplied by the sum of coefficients in the second expansion, which is \\(1 + 1 = 2\\), so 1 * 2 = 2. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) in the product would be 2, and similarly for \\(b^2\\). But in this case, if I set \\(c = 1\\), the sum is 2, so that works.\n\nAlternatively, if I wanted the coefficient of \\(a^2c^0\\), it would be 1 * 1 (from the constant term in the second expansion) = 1.\n\nSo, in the original problem, if we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), it's 6 * 64 = 384. If we're looking for \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), it's 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nGiven that the problem just says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", without specifying \\(c\\), I think it's more likely that they want the coefficient when considering all possible powers of \\(c\\), meaning 384. But I'm a bit unsure because sometimes problems like this expect you to consider only the constant term in \\(c\\). Let me check the problem again.\n\nWait, the problem is: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\).\" It doesn't specify any condition on \\(c\\), so I think the intended answer is 384, as that's the coefficient when considering all possible powers of \\(c\\). However, I might be wrong, and the problem might expect the coefficient when \\(c\\) is also at power zero, which would be 120.\n\nLet me try to see if there's another way to interpret it. Perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, considering all variables, which would mean that \\(a^2b^2\\) can be multiplied by any power of \\(c\\), but the coefficient is just the product of the coefficients from each part. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6, and the coefficient of any term in the second part is just the expansion, so the total coefficient would be 6 times the entire second expansion. But that doesn't make sense because the coefficient should be a number, not a polynomial.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is written in such a way that it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when the entire expression is considered as a product, meaning that the variables are independent, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would indeed be 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, giving 384.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting me to consider that \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just 6, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. But that doesn't make sense because the expression is a product, so each term from the first expansion is multiplied by each term from the second expansion.\n\nWait, let me think of it this way: The entire product is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). If I expand this, each term will be of the form \\(a^kb^{4 - k}c^{6 - 2m}\\), where \\(k\\) ranges from 0 to 4 and \\(m\\) ranges from 0 to 6. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would occur when \\(k = 2\\), and it would be multiplied by \\(c^{6 - 2m}\\) for each \\(m\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^{6 - 2m}\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}\\). But if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then it's the sum over all \\(m\\) of \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} \\times 2^6 = 6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\nAlternatively, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it's \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} \\times \\dbinom{6}{3} = 6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nGiven that the problem statement is a bit ambiguous, but considering that it's from a standard algebra problem, I think the intended answer is 120, because it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which would typically be interpreted as the coefficient when considering all variables, but since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), it's more likely that they want the coefficient when \\(c\\) is also at the zero power, making it a constant term.\n\nWait, but I'm not entirely sure. Let me try to compute both possibilities and see which makes more sense.\n\nIf I take the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), that's 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nIf I take the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), that's 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nBut let me check the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\).\" It doesn't specify any condition on \\(c\\), so it's ambiguous. However, in many algebra problems, when they ask for the coefficient of a term with specific variables, they usually mean the coefficient when those variables are present and the others are at their minimal exponents, often zero. So, perhaps they want 120.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to have the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by any power of \\(c\\), in which case it's 384.\n\nWait, another approach: The problem might be treating the entire expression as a single polynomial, and the term \\(a^2b^2\\) could be accompanied by any power of \\(c\\), so the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 64, giving 384.\n\nBut that seems a bit odd because the coefficient would then be a polynomial in \\(c\\), which isn't a single number. So, perhaps the problem is expecting the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nI think I need to go with 120 because that's the coefficient when \\(c\\) is at zero power, making the term a constant in terms of \\(c\\), and that's a more standard interpretation when variables are not specified.\n\nWait, but let me think again. If I have \\((a + b)^4\\) times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), then the entire product is a polynomial in \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\), and \\(1/c\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by each term from the second expansion, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), etc., down to \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by the coefficient from the first part. So, that would be 6 times (sum of coefficients in the second expansion), which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nBut wait, the sum of coefficients in the second expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), so \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\), which is correct. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but that seems to contradict the earlier thought where I thought it was 120. So, which is it?\n\nLet me clarify: When the problem asks for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, it's referring to all terms where \\(a\\) is squared and \\(b\\) is squared, regardless of the power of \\(c\\). Therefore, each such term will have a coefficient that's the product of the coefficient from the first expansion and the coefficient from the second expansion for that specific power of \\(c\\). Therefore, the total coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) across all powers of \\(c\\) is the sum of all these products.\n\nWait, no, that's not quite right. Because in the product, each term from the first expansion is multiplied by each term from the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), etc. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is actually the coefficient from the first expansion (which is 6) multiplied by each coefficient from the second expansion, resulting in multiple terms with \\(a^2b^2\\) and different powers of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is not a single number but rather a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for a coefficient, which is a number, so perhaps they are only interested in the coefficient when \\(c\\) is at a specific power, likely zero.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the entire product as a single expression and wants the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which would be 6 times the entire second expansion, but that would make the coefficient a polynomial, not a number.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is intended to have the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120, as that's the term where \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are squared and \\(c\\) is to the zero power, making it a constant term. That would make sense because the problem is asking for a specific coefficient, not a polynomial.\n\nGiven that, I think the correct answer is 120.\n\nWait, but to be thorough, let me compute both scenarios.\n\nFirst, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\): As calculated earlier, it's 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nSecond, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) across all powers of \\(c\\): That would be 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nBut since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), without specifying \\(c\\), I think the intended answer is 384. Because when you have a product of two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in one variable is the product of the coefficient of that term in the first polynomial and the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial.\n\nWait, but that doesn't seem quite right because the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial is indeed 64, but when you multiply 6 by 64, you get 384, which would be the coefficient if you were looking for the term \\(a^2b^2\\) times any power of \\(c\\). But in reality, each term in the second expansion contributes a different power of \\(c\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^{6 - 2m}\\) is 6 * \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\), but the problem isn't specifying \\(c\\), so I'm not sure.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is written in such a way that it's actually considering \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) as separate from \\(c\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just 6, and the rest is part of the expression. But that seems unlikely because the entire expression is a product.\n\nWait, another angle: If I consider that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, meaning that we can treat \\(c\\) as another variable, but since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are separate, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the entire expansion of the second part, which is 64, giving 384. But again, that would make the coefficient a polynomial, which doesn't make sense.\n\nI think I'm stuck between two interpretations. To resolve this, perhaps I should look for similar problems or think about how such problems are typically structured.\n\nIn most algebra problems, when they ask for the coefficient of a specific term in a product of two expressions, they usually mean the coefficient when considering all variables. So, for example, if you have \\((x + y)^2 \\times (z + w)^3\\), the coefficient of \\(x^2\\) would be 1 times the sum of coefficients in the second expansion, which is \\(2^3 = 8\\), so the coefficient of \\(x^2\\) would be 8.\n\nApplying that logic here, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nBut wait, in that case, the coefficient would be a polynomial, but in reality, each term in the second expansion is a different power of \\(c\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is actually 6 times each term in the second expansion, resulting in multiple terms with \\(a^2b^2\\) and different powers of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient isn't a single number but rather a set of coefficients multiplied by different powers of \\(c\\).\n\nGiven that, perhaps the problem is intended to ask for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120, as that's a specific term. Alternatively, maybe the problem is expecting the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without considering \\(c\\), which would be 6, but that seems too simplistic.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, ignoring the second part, but that doesn't make sense because the entire expression is a product.\n\nWait, let me read the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" It's possible that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when considering the entire expression, meaning that \\(c\\) is treated as a separate variable, and the coefficient is just 6, but that seems incorrect because the entire expression is a product, so each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second.\n\nI think the confusion arises because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without specifying \\(c\\), which is ambiguous. However, given that the problem includes both \\(a, b\\) and \\(c\\) in the expression, it's likely that they want the coefficient when \\(c\\) is also at a specific power, likely zero, making it a constant term. Therefore, the coefficient is 120.\n\nBut to be thorough, let me compute both possibilities.\n\nFirst, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nSecond, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) across all powers of \\(c\\) is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nGiven that, and considering that the problem is likely expecting a single numerical answer, I think the intended answer is 120, as that corresponds to the term where \\(c\\) is at zero power, making it a constant term. Therefore, the coefficient is 120.\n\nWait, but let me think again. If I expand the entire product, each term will be of the form \\(a^kb^{4 - k}c^{6 - 2m}\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the sum over all \\(m\\) of \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} \\dbinom{6}{m}\\), which is 6 times the sum from \\(m = 0\\) to \\(m = 6\\) of \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\). But the sum of \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\) from \\(m = 0\\) to \\(6\\) is \\(2^6 = 64\\), so the total coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but that's the coefficient if we're considering all possible powers of \\(c\\). So, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), it's 384. But if it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), it's 120.\n\nGiven that the problem is written as it is, without specifying \\(c\\), I think the correct interpretation is that they want the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, which would be 384. Therefore, the answer is 384.\n\nBut wait, I'm getting conflicting interpretations. Let me try to see if I can find a definitive answer.\n\nIf I consider that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, then the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, if they are asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), it's 120.\n\nBut since the problem doesn't specify \\(c\\), I think the intended answer is 384.\n\nWait, but let me think about the problem differently. Suppose I set \\(c = 1\\). Then, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the entire expression becomes \\((a + b)^4 \\times 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in this expression is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nThat makes sense because setting \\(c = 1\\) gives the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which when multiplied by the first expansion gives the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) as 384.\n\nTherefore, I think the correct answer is 384.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was 120. I'm confused now.\n\nLet me try to clarify with an example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^1 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). The expansion is \\((a + b)(c + 1/c)\\). The coefficient of \\(a\\) would be 1 times the sum of coefficients in the second expansion, which is \\(1 + 1 = 2\\), so 2. Similarly, the coefficient of \\(b\\) would be 2. But if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a c^0\\), that's 1 * 1 = 1.\n\nSo, in this case, the coefficient of \\(a\\) in the product is 2, which is the sum of coefficients in the second expansion times the coefficient of \\(a\\) in the first expansion. Therefore, applying that logic, in the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the sum of coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, giving 384.\n\nTherefore, I think the correct answer is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is found by expanding each part separately and then combining the coefficients. \n\n1. Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is 6.\n2. The entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) contributes a sum of coefficients equal to \\(2^6 = 64\\) when \\(c = 1\\).\n3. Multiply the two coefficients: \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\boxed{384}."

    "text": " I'm a bit confused because there are two parts to this expression: one involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the other involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). But the question is only asking about the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so maybe I don't need to worry about the \\(c\\) terms? Or do I? Wait, actually, when you multiply two expressions together, every term from the first expression gets multiplied by every term in the second expression. So, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will come from the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), and then it will be multiplied by some term from the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since the question is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, maybe I just need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and then consider that it will be multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Hmm, no, that might not be right. Let me think again.\n\nWait, no. When you multiply two polynomials, the coefficients of the product are convolutions of the coefficients of the original polynomials. So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), it's actually the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), I think the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, that doesn't seem quite right either because each term in the product is a combination of terms from both expansions.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. That is, in the entire expression, we're looking for all terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) appears, and each of those terms will also have some power of \\(c\\). But the question is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would be the sum of all coefficients from the second part multiplied by the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part. Wait, no, that's not correct because the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first part is just a single term, and when multiplied by the entire second part, it becomes \\(a^2b^2\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But I'm not sure if that's the right approach.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me break it down. The expression is \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from expanding \\((a + b)^4\\). So, first, I can find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), and then, since this term is multiplied by every term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, that can't be right because the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) would be when \\(c = 1\\), so substituting \\(c = 1\\) gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times 64.\n\nWait, but let me check that. If I have \\((a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. Then, the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is a polynomial in \\(c\\), and when I multiply 6a^2b^2 by the entire expansion, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But the sum of coefficients in a polynomial is found by setting all variables to 1. So, substituting \\(c = 1\\), we get \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 * 64 = 384. Wait, but that seems too straightforward. Let me think again.\n\nWait, but the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not considering \\(c\\). So, in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term is of the form \\(a^kb^{4 - k} c^m\\) where \\(k\\) ranges from 0 to 4 and \\(m\\) ranges based on the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But when we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), we're only interested in the terms where \\(k = 2\\), so \\(a^2b^2\\), and then multiplied by any power of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is indeed 6 * 64 = 384. So, I think that's the answer.\n\nBut wait, let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. Another way to think about it is that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the product of the coefficients from each part where the exponents add up appropriately. But since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems a bit off because the entire expansion includes terms with \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), but we're only interested in the \\(a^2b^2\\) term regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, actually, the coefficient would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 64, as before. So, 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me check with another approach. Let's expand \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) separately and then see how the coefficients combine. The expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is:\n\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\binom{4}{k} a^{k} b^{4 - k}\n\\]\n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\binom{4}{2} = 6\\), as I found earlier.\n\nNow, the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is:\n\n\\[\n\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\binom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\binom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n\\]\n\nSo, each term in this expansion is \\(\\binom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\) for \\(m\\) from 0 to 6.\n\nNow, when we multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the product is the product of a term from \\((a + b)^4\\) and a term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) (which is 6) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). As I calculated earlier, the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is when \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, the total coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me make sure that this is correct. Another way to think about it is that when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum of the products of the coefficients of terms in the first polynomial that multiply to give that specific term. But in this case, since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient would be the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is indeed 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me check if this approach is correct. Suppose I have two polynomials, P(a, b) and Q(c). Then, the product P(a, b) * Q(c) would have terms like (terms from P) * (terms from Q). So, the coefficient of a specific term in P, say \\(a^2b^2\\), when multiplied by Q, would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in P times the sum of all coefficients in Q, because each term in Q is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). So, yes, that makes sense.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but just to be thorough, let me compute the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) and confirm that the sum of its coefficients is 64. Let's compute it:\n\n\\[\n\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\binom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\binom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n\\]\n\nSo, the coefficients are \\(\\binom{6}{m}\\) for m from 0 to 6. The sum of these coefficients is when we set \\(c = 1\\):\n\n\\[\n(1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\n\\]\n\nYes, that's correct. So, the sum of the coefficients is indeed 64.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not missing anything. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so that would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for any integer \\(k\\). But since the question doesn't specify any particular power of \\(c\\), it's just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, that would mean summing over all possible \\(k\\) the coefficients of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), which is the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, the final answer is 384.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Another approach: when you have two polynomials multiplied together, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum over all possible products of coefficients from each polynomial whose exponents add up to the desired term. In this case, the desired term is \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\). So, in the first polynomial, \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. In the second polynomial, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) (since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't have any \\(c\\) term) is the middle term when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which is when \\(m = 3\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\binom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n\nWait, hold on! That's a different approach. So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, it's the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\) to get \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is just \\(a^2b^2\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, now I'm confused because earlier I thought it was 384, but now I'm getting 120. Which one is correct?\n\nLet me clarify. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Now, if the expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), then each term in the product is of the form \\(a^kb^{4 - k}c^{m}\\), where \\(k\\) is from 0 to 4 and \\(m\\) is from -6 to 6 in steps of 2. But the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). So, to get the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), we need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product. Therefore, it's the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nSo, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\binom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n\nIn \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is the middle term when the exponent is 0. So, we have:\n\n\\[\n\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\binom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n\\]\n\nWe want the exponent \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(\\binom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product is \\(6 * 20 = 120\\).\n\nWait, so earlier I thought it was 384, but now I'm getting 120. Which one is correct?\n\nI think I made a mistake earlier by considering the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 64, but that would be the case if we were looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) summed over all \\(k\\). But the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). Therefore, the correct approach is to take the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and multiply it by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20, giving 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nSo, why did I think earlier that it was 384? Because I was considering that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that's only the case if we're summing over all possible \\(c\\) terms. But the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which specifically doesn't involve any \\(c\\) terms, so we're looking for \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is why we need to multiply by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\).\n\nLet me confirm this with an example. Suppose I have two polynomials: \\(P(a, b) = (a + b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2\\) and \\(Q(c) = (c + 1/c)^1 = c + 1/c\\). Now, the product is \\(P(a, b) * Q(c) = (a^2 + 2ab + b^2)(c + 1/c)\\). If I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which in this case doesn't exist because \\(P(a, b)\\) only goes up to \\(b^2\\), but if I consider a similar problem, say, looking for the coefficient of \\(ab\\) in \\(P(a, b) * Q(c)\\). Then, in \\(P(a, b)\\), the coefficient of \\(ab\\) is 2. In \\(Q(c)\\), the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 0 because \\(Q(c)\\) is \\(c + 1/c\\), which has no constant term. So, the coefficient of \\(ab\\) in the product would be 2 * 0 = 0. But if I instead summed all coefficients in \\(Q(c)\\), which is \\(1 + 1 = 2\\), then I would get 2 * 2 = 4, which would be incorrect because there's no \\(ab\\) term in the product. Therefore, the correct approach is to multiply by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(Q(c)\\), which is 0, giving 0.\n\nSimilarly, in the original problem, we need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which requires multiplying the coefficients of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the correct coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nSo, I think I made a mistake earlier by considering the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial. The correct approach is to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20, and multiply it by 6, giving 120.\n\nWait, but let me make sure. Let's compute \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) and see the coefficient of \\(c^0\\). As I did earlier, it's \\(\\binom{6}{3} = 20\\), so that's correct.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 120.\n\nWait, but just to be absolutely certain, let me think about how the product works. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\), and when multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), it becomes \\(a^2b^2\\) times each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the sum over all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) multiplied by the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\). But wait, no, that's not correct because each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) would be 6 * (coefficient of \\(c^k\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) (which is \\(a^2b^2c^0\\)) is 6 * (coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)), which is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So, the correct answer is 120.\n\nI think I initially confused the problem by considering the sum of all coefficients, but upon realizing that the term \\(a^2b^2\\) specifically requires the \\(c^0\\) term, I corrected my approach. So, the final answer is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and multiplying it by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\n1. **Find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\):**\n   Using the binomial theorem, the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is:\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\binom{4}{k} a^{k} b^{4 - k}\n   \\]\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\binom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n\n2. **Find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   The expansion is:\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\binom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n   \\]\n   The term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0 occurs when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which gives \\(m = 3\\).

    "text": " I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these kinds of problems, but I'll give it a shot.\n\nFirst off, I know that when you have an expression like \\((a + b)^n\\), you can expand it using the binomial theorem. The binomial theorem says that each term in the expansion is of the form \\(\\dbinom{n}{k} a^{n - k}b^k\\), where \\(k\\) ranges from 0 to \\(n\\). So maybe I can apply that here for the \\((a + b)^4\\) part.\n\nLet me write that down. The expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) would be:\n\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n\\]\n\nRight, so each term is \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\\). I'm looking for the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2, so \\(a^2b^2\\). That means I need to find the value of \\(k\\) such that \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). Let me check: if \\(k = 2\\), then \\(4 - 2 = 2\\), so that's correct. So the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\).\n\nCalculating that, \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So the coefficient is 6, and the term is \\(6a^2b^2\\). Okay, so that's the first part done.\n\nNow, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So the second part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I think I can expand this part as well using the binomial theorem. Let me write that out.\n\nThe expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) would be:\n\n\\[\n\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\n\\]\n\nSimplifying the exponents, \\(c^{6 - m} \\times c^{-m} = c^{6 - 2m}\\). So each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). I need to find the coefficient for each term in this expansion, but wait, in the original problem, I'm only asked about the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So actually, when I multiply the two expansions together, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression will just be the coefficient from the first part times the sum of the coefficients from the second part. Wait, no, that doesn't sound right.\n\nWait, no, actually, when you multiply two expressions together, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. But since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term in the first expression, and the second expression is in terms of \\(c\\), the product will have terms like \\(a^2b^2 \\times c^{6 - 2m}\\). So the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would just be the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all coefficients in the second part, because each term in the second part is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, but that can't be right because each term in the second expansion is a different power of \\(c\\), so when you multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), you get terms like \\(6a^2b^2 c^{6}\\), \\(6a^2b^2 c^{4}\\), etc., each with their own coefficients.\n\nWait, but the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\). So actually, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would only appear once, when multiplied by the constant term in the second expansion. Because if the second expansion has a term without \\(c\\), which would be when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, then that term would be \\( \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{0} \\) where \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), so \\(m = 3\\).\n\nSo, let me think again. The first part gives me \\(6a^2b^2\\), and the second part, when expanded, has a term where \\(m = 3\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} c^{0} = 20 \\times 1 = 20\\). So when I multiply \\(6a^2b^2\\) by this term, I get \\(6 \\times 20 a^2b^2 = 120 a^2b^2\\). So the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't miss anything. Let me go through it again step by step.\n\nFirst, expanding \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). So that's correct.\n\nNext, expanding \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). The general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\times (1/c)^m = \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So the exponents of \\(c\\) are \\(6 - 2m\\), where \\(m\\) ranges from 0 to 6.\n\nNow, when I multiply the two expressions together, each term from the first expansion is multiplied by each term from the second. So the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, resulting in terms like \\(6a^2b^2 c^{6 - 2m}\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). Wait, no, that's not possible because \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), so the only way for \\(a^2b^2\\) to appear without any \\(c\\) is when it's multiplied by the constant term in the second expansion, i.e., when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which happens when \\(m = 3\\).\n\nSo, the term in the second expansion when \\(m = 3\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} c^{0} = 20\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nWait, but hold on a second. Let me think again. If the problem had been asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), then yes, it would involve multiplying by the appropriate term from the second expansion. But since it's just \\(a^2b^2\\), without any \\(c\\) terms, the only way that can happen is if it's multiplied by the constant term in the second expansion. So that means the coefficient is indeed 6 times 20, which is 120.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem had been asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), for example, then I would have to find the term where \\(6 - 2m = 4\\), so \\(m = 1\\), and then multiply 6 by \\(\\dbinom{6}{1}\\) which is 6, giving 36. But in this case, since it's just \\(a^2b^2\\), the only way that term appears is when multiplied by \\(c^0\\), so \\(m=3\\).\n\nWait, but let me check: if I didn't consider the \\(c\\) terms, would I get a different answer? Let me see. If I thought that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is just the product of the coefficients of \\(a^2b^2\\) in each part, but that's only true if the second part has a constant term. So in this case, yes, because the second part does have a constant term when \\(m=3\\), which is 20. So the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but another way to think about it is that when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum of the products of the coefficients of terms whose variables multiply to give that specific term. In this case, since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is to multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first polynomial by the constant term from the second polynomial. So that makes sense.\n\nLet me also compute \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\) to make sure. \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6*6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). Yep, that's correct.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but just to be thorough, let me consider if there's any other way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. Suppose I have \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part and then, say, \\(c^6\\) from the second part. But then the term would be \\(6a^2b^2c^6\\), which isn't \\(a^2b^2\\) alone. Similarly, if I take \\(a^2b^2\\) and multiply by \\(c^4\\), that's \\(6a^2b^2c^4\\), which again isn't just \\(a^2b^2\\). The only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms is to multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by 1, which comes from the constant term in the second expansion. So yes, that's the only term that contributes.\n\nTherefore, I'm confident that the coefficient is 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem for both parts of the expression.\n\n1. **Expanding \\((a + b)^4\\):**\n   Using the binomial theorem, the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is:\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\).

So, for \\((a + b)^4\\), I can expand this and find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\).\n\nLet me write that out. The general term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k} b^k\\). I need the term where the exponent of \\(a\\) is 2 and the exponent of \\(b\\) is 2. So, \\(4 - k = 2\\), which means \\(k = 2\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\).\n\nCalculating that, \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\).

Since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I think we don't need to consider the second part because \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) don't appear there. Wait, is that correct?\n\nLet me think again. The expression is a product of two separate expansions. So, when we multiply them, each term from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term from the second expansion. However, since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), we can consider that this term will be multiplied by all possible terms from the second expansion. But since we're just looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, maybe the coefficient remains 6, and the \\(c\\) terms just tag along as a separate factor.\n\nWait, no, actually, when we multiply two expressions, the coefficients multiply as well. But in this case, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is being multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, does that mean the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)? That doesn't make sense because the question is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not considering \\(c\\). \n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me re-examine the problem: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, actually, we are looking for the coefficient of the term \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by any term from the second expansion. But since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are only in the first part, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by every term from the second expansion, each time contributing a different power of \\(c\\). But the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). \n\nWait, but that doesn't make sense because the coefficient in the entire product would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial in \\(c\\). So, actually, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would have a coefficient that's a polynomial in \\(c\\), not just a single number. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which suggests it's a constant, not depending on \\(c\\). Hmm, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some \\(k\\), but it's written as \\(a^2b^2\\). Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the entire expression as a polynomial in \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\), and \\(1/c\\), and it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a sum over all possible \\(c\\) terms multiplied by 6. But that seems odd because the coefficient would then be a polynomial, not a single number.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to re-express the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, it's a product of two polynomials, one in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the other in \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). When you multiply them, the terms are products of terms from each polynomial. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first polynomial is multiplied by each term from the second polynomial, which are of the form \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\).\n\nTherefore, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will have a coefficient that is the sum of all the coefficients from the second polynomial, because it's being multiplied by each term.

But that can't be right because the coefficient should be a single number, not a polynomial.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when considering only the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms, ignoring \\(c\\). But that doesn't make much sense because \\(c\\) is part of the expression. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the constant term with respect to \\(c\\). That would make sense because then we're looking for the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2, and the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out to zero.\n\nSo, let's assume that's the case. Then, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) would be the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part.\n\nSo, let's break it down:\n\n1. Coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, as I calculated earlier.\n\n2. Coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let's find that.\n\nUsing the binomial theorem again, the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\).\n\nWe need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0. So, set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\).\n\nTherefore, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\).\n\nCalculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Wait, 6! is 720, 3! is 6, so 720/(6*6) is 720/36 = 20. Yes, that's correct.\n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire expression is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but the problem just says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\". So, if we're considering the entire expression, which includes \\(c\\) terms, then \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by various powers of \\(c\\). So, perhaps the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), but the problem is asking for the coefficient, which is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that can't be right because the coefficient is supposed to be a single number, not a polynomial.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, meaning we're treating \\(c\\) as an independent variable and just looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. But in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which would be a polynomial in \\(c\\), not a single number.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think again. Maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, which is a product of two polynomials. So, in the product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by every term from the second polynomial. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when considering the entire expression, but only the part that's multiplied by \\(c^0\\), i.e., the constant term with respect to \\(c\\). That would make sense because then the coefficient would be a single number. So, in that case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\) is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but that seems unlikely because the coefficient is supposed to be a number, not a polynomial.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to clarify the problem statement. It says, \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, it's possible that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, meaning that we're treating \\(c\\) as an independent variable and just want the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which would indeed be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, which is a bit unusual because coefficients are typically numbers, not polynomials.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is miswritten, and it's actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be 120, as I calculated earlier.\n\nWait, let me check the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, it's possible that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, meaning that we're only considering the part of the product that has \\(a^2b^2\\), and the \\(c\\) terms can be anything. But in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial in \\(c\\). So, the coefficient isn't a single number but a polynomial.\n\nBut the problem is asking for \"the coefficient\", implying a single number. Therefore, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be 120, as I found earlier.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when considering the entire product, which would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but that seems unlikely because the coefficient is supposed to be a number.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Let me try a different approach. Let me consider the entire product as a polynomial in \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\), and \\(1/c\\). Each term in the product will be of the form \\(a^{k}b^{4 - k}c^{m}\\), where \\(k\\) ranges from 0 to 4, and \\(m\\) ranges depending on the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\).\n\nBut the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which means \\(k = 2\\), so the term is \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by any term from the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the sum over all possible coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by 6. But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a single number.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable, meaning that the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem says \"the coefficient\", which is usually a number, not a polynomial. So, perhaps the problem is miswritten, or I'm misinterpreting it.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when considering the entire product, but only the constant term with respect to \\(c\\), i.e., the term where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out. So, that would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nGiven that, I think the intended answer is 120, so the coefficient is 120.\n\nWait, but to be thorough, let me double-check. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is indeed 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But if we're only interested in the term where \\(c\\) cancels out, then it's 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nAlternatively, if we're considering all terms, then the coefficient is a polynomial, but since the problem is asking for \"the coefficient\", it's likely that it's asking for the constant term with respect to \\(c\\), which is 120.\n\nTherefore, I think the answer is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplying it by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20. Therefore, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\boxed{120}"

So, maybe I can apply this to both parts of the given expression separately and then multiply them together.\n\nLet me start by expanding \\((a + b)^4\\). Using the binomial theorem, the expansion will have terms from \\(k = 0\\) to \\(k = 4\\). The general term is \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}a^{4 - k}b^k\\). I'm specifically looking for the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2, so that would be when \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). Let me calculate that coefficient.\n\n\\[\n\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\n\\]\n\nSo, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.

I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, but the second part of the expression involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), which are different variables from \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). So, does that mean the terms involving \\(c\\) don't affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)? I think so because \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are separate variables, so their exponents won't interfere with each other. Therefore, maybe I can treat each part separately and then multiply the coefficients.\n\nLet me break it down. First, I'll find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\). Then, I'll find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) because when I multiply the two expressions together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by every term in the second expansion, but since I only want the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\), the exponent of \\(c\\) must be zero so that it doesn't contribute any \\(c\\) terms. That way, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will just be multiplied by the constant term (if it exists) from the second expansion.\n\nWait, is that right? Let me think again. So, if I have \\((a + b)^4\\) times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), when I expand both, each term in the first expansion will multiply each term in the second expansion. So, for the term \\(a^2b^2\\), which comes from the first part, I need to find all terms in the second expansion that are constants, i.e., where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, so that when I multiply, the resulting term will be \\(a^2b^2\\) times that constant. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression will be the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part.\n\nOkay, so let's start with the first part: \\((a + b)^4\\). Using the binomial theorem, the expansion is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\\). I need the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2. So, that would be when \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). Therefore, the term is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}a^2b^2\\). The coefficient here is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\).\n\nCalculating that, \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\nNow, moving on to the second part: \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Again, using the binomial theorem, this expands to \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\).

So, I set the exponent equal to zero: \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(6 = 2m\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} c^{0} = \\dbinom{6}{3}\\).\n\nCalculating \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\), that's \\(\\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion is 20.\n\nNow, since the two parts are multiplied together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the two coefficients I found. That is, \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nWait, let me double-check to make sure I didn't make a mistake. So, in the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6 because \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). In the second part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero occurs when \\(m = 3\\), and the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).

But if the problem is expecting a coefficient that includes all possible terms with \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), then it would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial. But I think the problem is more likely asking for the coefficient when considering only the constant term in \\(c\\), so the answer would be 120.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. When you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first polynomial gets multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6a^2b^2. Then, when multiplied by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is a sum of terms involving different powers of \\(c\\), each term in the product will be of the form 6a^2b^2 \\times \\text{(term from the second expansion)}.\n\nSo, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), it's actually asking for all the coefficients where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any power of \\(c\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make much sense because the problem is probably expecting a numerical coefficient. Therefore, I think the intended interpretation is that the problem wants the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the constant term with respect to \\(c\\).\n\nTherefore, I think my initial approach is correct: the coefficient is 6 multiplied by the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 20, so 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but just to be thorough, let me compute the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) to confirm the constant term.\n\nUsing the binomial theorem, the expansion is:\n\n\\[\n\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n\\]\n\nWe need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, so:\n\n\\(6 - 2k = 0\\) => \\(k = 3\\)\n\nSo, the term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} c^{0} = 20\\), which matches what I found earlier.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, considering only the constant term with respect to \\(c\\), is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not missing anything else. Is there a possibility that the problem wants the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without considering \\(c\\), meaning that the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which would make the coefficient a polynomial. But that seems unlikely because the problem is asking for a coefficient, which is usually a number.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, which doesn't seem right. So, I think the correct interpretation is that the problem wants the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nWait, another way to think about it is that when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second part, which includes various powers of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient isn't a single number but a polynomial. However, the problem is phrased as \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", which suggests that it's considering the term \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which would be a polynomial. But that seems odd because usually, coefficients are numerical.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is the term where \\(c\\) is raised to the zero power, making it a constant. That would make the coefficient a number, which is 120 as I calculated earlier.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, which would include all the terms from the second expansion. But that would make the coefficient a polynomial, which doesn't seem to be what the problem is asking for. Therefore, I think the intended answer is 120, considering only the constant term in \\(c\\).\n\nWait, let me try another approach. Maybe I can think of the entire expression as a product of two independent expansions. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is a separate polynomial. So, when you multiply them together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, which is 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that seems too involved, and the problem is likely expecting a numerical coefficient.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is only considering the terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\), which would make the coefficient 6 times the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 20, so 6*20=120.\n\nWait, but let me check if there's another way to interpret this. Suppose I consider the entire product and look for the term \\(a^2b^2\\), which would be present in the expansion regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would make the coefficient a polynomial, which doesn't seem right. Therefore, I think the problem is asking for the coefficient when \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\), so the answer is 120.\n\nWait, but let me think again. If I expand \\((a + b)^4\\), I get terms involving \\(a^4, a^3b, a^2b^2, ab^3, b^4\\), each with their coefficients. Similarly, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) will have terms involving \\(c^6, c^4, c^2, 1, c^{-2}, c^{-4}, c^{-6}\\), each with their coefficients. So, when I multiply these two expansions together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second part, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6, a^2b^2c^4, a^2b^2c^2, a^2b^2, a^2b^2c^{-2}, a^2b^2c^{-4}, a^2b^2c^{-6}\\), each with coefficients 6 times the respective coefficients from the second expansion.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial. But the problem is asking for \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", which is a bit ambiguous. If it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then the coefficient is the polynomial \\(6\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that seems unlikely because the problem is probably expecting a numerical coefficient.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is the term where \\(c\\) is raised to the zero power, then the coefficient is 6 times the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 20, so 6*20=120.\n\nWait, let me check if the problem statement includes any mention of \\(c\\). It just says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", so maybe it's considering the entire product and just wants the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. But in that case, the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\), which is \\(6\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that seems too complex for the problem, so perhaps the intended interpretation is that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nWait, another thought: maybe the problem is in a context where \\(c\\) is a variable that's being held constant or something, but I don't think so. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only considering the terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present, regardless of \\(c\\), but that would still make the coefficient a polynomial.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by 1 (i.e., \\(c^0\\)). That would make sense, and the coefficient would be 120.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, but that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, which doesn't seem right. So, I think the correct interpretation is that the problem wants the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nWait, let me make sure I'm not missing any steps. So, to recap:\n\n1. Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is 6.\n\n2. Expand \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) to find the constant term, which is 20.\n\n3. Multiply these two coefficients together to get 6*20=120.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, if I didn't consider the constant term, and just multiplied the entire expansion, I would get a polynomial, but that's not what the problem is asking for.\n\nTherefore, I think the answer is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplying it by the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20. Therefore, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\boxed{120}."

    "text": " \n\nFirst, I remember that when you have an expression like \\((a + b)^n\\), you can expand it using the binomial theorem. The binomial theorem says that \\((a + b)^n = \\sum_{k=0}^{n} \\dbinom{n}{k} a^{n - k} b^k\\). So, maybe I can apply that here for the \\((a + b)^4\\) part.\n\nLet me write down the expansion for \\((a + b)^4\\). Using the binomial theorem, each term will be \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k} b^k\\) where \\(k\\) goes from 0 to 4. So, the expansion will have terms like \\(a^4\\), \\(4a^3b\\), \\(6a^2b^2\\), \\(4ab^3\\), and \\(b^4\\). \n\nWait, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. That's because when \\(k = 2\\), the term is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} a^{2}b^{2}\\), and \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) is 6. So, the coefficient is 6. \n\nBut the original problem isn't just \\((a + b)^4\\); it's multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I need to consider the entire expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nNow, I'm trying to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). But wait, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is only from the \\((a + b)^4\\) part. The other part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\); it's only in terms of \\(c\\). So, when I multiply the two expressions together, each term from \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nBut I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). That means I don't care about the powers of \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), right? Because the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by some term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but since I'm only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), the other part can be any term from the second expansion. \n\nWait, but actually, no. Because when you multiply two polynomials, each term from the first is multiplied by each term from the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by every term in the second part. But since the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\), that means I need to sum up all the coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by the 6 from the first part.\n\nWait, that doesn't sound right. Let me think again. \n\nIf I have \\((a + b)^4\\) expanded as \\(a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\), and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) expanded as some terms involving \\(c\\). When I multiply these two, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nWait, but that seems too broad. Because the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) would be found by setting \\(c = 1\\). Let me check that. If I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of the coefficients is 64. \n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 * 64 = 384. Hmm, is that correct? Let me make sure I'm not missing something.\n\nWait, but actually, no. Because when you multiply two polynomials, each term from the first is multiplied by each term from the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first polynomial will be multiplied by each term in the second polynomial, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be 6 times each coefficient from the second polynomial, but that's not quite right because each term in the product will have different powers of \\(c\\). \n\nWait, but the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), without considering the \\(c\\) terms. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because each term from the second polynomial is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). \n\nBut let me think again. If I have \\( (a^2b^2) \\times \\left( \\text{something} \\right) \\), then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be \\(6 \\times\\) the sum of the coefficients of all terms in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the sum of coefficients in the second polynomial.\n\nBut the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is indeed found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\( (1 + 1)^6 = 64 \\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). \n\nWait, but that seems high. Let me double-check by expanding both parts.\n\nFirst, \\((a + b)^4\\) gives \\(a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6.\n\nNow, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) can be expanded using the binomial theorem as well. Each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). \n\nSo, the expansion is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). The coefficients here are \\(\\dbinom{6}{0}=1\\), \\(\\dbinom{6}{1}=6\\), \\(\\dbinom{6}{2}=15\\), \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}=20\\), \\(\\dbinom{6}{4}=15\\), \\(\\dbinom{6}{5}=6\\), \\(\\dbinom{6}{6}=1\\). \n\nSo, the sum of the coefficients is \\(1 + 6 + 15 + 20 + 15 + 6 + 1 = 64\\), which matches what I found earlier by setting \\(c = 1\\).\n\nTherefore, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first polynomial will be multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be the coefficient from the first part (which is 6) multiplied by the sum of coefficients from the second part (which is 64). \n\nTherefore, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). \n\nWait, but I'm not sure if I'm supposed to consider that the second part has terms with different powers of \\(c\\), but since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then yes, it's just 6 times 64. \n\nAlternatively, if the problem had asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some specific \\(k\\), then I would have to find the specific term in the second expansion that has \\(c^k\\) and multiply it by 6. But since it's just \\(a^2b^2\\), without any condition on \\(c\\), then I think it's correct to sum all coefficients from the second part and multiply by 6.\n\nSo, I think the coefficient is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 64. Multiplying these together gives \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n\\boxed{384}"

    "text": " I remember that when dealing with expansions, the binomial theorem is really useful. Let me recall how that works.\n\nFirst, I think I should handle each part of the expression separately. That is, expand \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) individually, and then see how they interact. But wait, the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, maybe I don't need to fully expand both expressions, but instead focus on the parts that contribute to \\(a^2b^2\\).\n\nLet me start with the first part: \\((a + b)^4\\). Using the binomial theorem, which says that \\((x + y)^n = \\sum_{k=0}^{n} \\dbinom{n}{k} x^{n - k} y^k\\), I can expand this. So, for \\((a + b)^4\\), the expansion will be:\n\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k} b^{k}\n\\]\n\nI need the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2. That would be when \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). So, the term is:\n\n\\[\n\\dbinom{4}{2} a^{2} b^{2}\n\\]\n\nCalculating the binomial coefficient, \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\), which is \\(\\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\\). So, the coefficient here is 6, and the term is \\(6a^2b^2\\).\n\nOkay, so in the first part, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. Now, what about the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)? Since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and this part involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), I think the variables \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\). So, maybe the terms involving \\(c\\) don't affect the \\(a^2b^2\\) term? Wait, but the entire expression is the product of the two expansions. So, to get the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I need to consider all possible products where the other factors (from the second expansion) multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. Hmm, but actually, since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are different variables, the product would have terms like \\(a^2b^2 \\times c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2 \\times c^{-k}\\), but the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) itself would just be the product of the coefficients from each part, because the other terms involve different variables.\n\nWait, let me think again. When I multiply two polynomials, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second. So, if I have a term \\(6a^2b^2\\) in the first part, and then I multiply it by every term in the second expansion \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each of those products will be terms in the final expansion. However, the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, does that mean I need to sum the coefficients of all terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any power of \\(c\\)?\n\nWait, no. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) itself doesn't involve \\(c\\), so when I multiply \\(6a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, I'll get terms like \\(6a^2b^2c^k\\) and \\(6a^2b^2c^{-k}\\), but the coefficient for each of these terms will be 6 times the coefficient from the second expansion. However, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but in the entire product, \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by various powers of \\(c\\). So, actually, \\(a^2b^2\\) will appear in multiple terms in the product, each multiplied by a different power of \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) term. So, does that mean we're just looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times any power of \\(c\\), and sum those coefficients? Or is it only looking for \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms?\n\nWait, the problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\". So, in the entire expression, \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by different powers of \\(c\\). So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), it's actually the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by 6, because each term in the second expansion when multiplied by \\(6a^2b^2\\) gives a term with \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by some power of \\(c\\). But the problem might just be asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) irrespective of the \\(c\\) term, meaning that we might just consider the coefficient as 6, but that doesn't seem right because the entire expression is a product.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me re-read the problem: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, in the entire expanded expression, we have terms like \\(a^kb^m c^n\\) or similar. The problem is asking for the coefficient of the specific term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2, regardless of the exponent of \\(c\\). So, we need to find all terms in the product where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present, multiplied by any power of \\(c\\), and sum their coefficients.\n\nWait, but if that's the case, then the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, because each term in the second expansion is multiplied by \\(6a^2b^2\\). But the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, the total coefficient would be \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). But that seems too high, and I'm not sure if that's what the problem is asking for.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. Maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of the term \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, meaning that we should consider all possible products where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any power of \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would indeed be 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, giving 384.\n\nBut let me think again. Alternatively, maybe the problem is only asking for the coefficient of the term \\(a^2b^2\\) without considering \\(c\\), but since \\(c\\) is another variable, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would only appear once, multiplied by the constant term from the second expansion. Wait, no, that doesn't make sense because the second expansion is in terms of \\(c\\), so when you multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), you'd have terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), etc., down to \\(a^2b^2c^{-6}\\). So, each of these terms would have a coefficient, and if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), then it's the sum of all these coefficients.\n\nWait, but perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me check an example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^2(c + 1/c)^1\\). Expanding this, we get \\((a^2 + 2ab + b^2)(c + 1/c)\\). The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be zero because in the expansion, the terms are \\(a^2c\\), \\(a^2 \\cdot 1/c\\), \\(2ab c\\), \\(2ab \\cdot 1/c\\), \\(b^2c\\), and \\(b^2 \\cdot 1/c\\). There's no \\(a^2b^2\\) term here because the first expansion is only up to \\(b^2\\), but the second expansion is only to the first power. So, in that case, the coefficient is zero. Hmm, but in our original problem, the first expansion is to the fourth power, so \\(a^2b^2\\) is present, and the second expansion is to the sixth power. So, when we multiply, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), etc. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by 6. Because each term in the second expansion is multiplied by \\(6a^2b^2\\), so the coefficient for each term would be 6 times the coefficient from the second expansion. Therefore, the total coefficient would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion.\n\nBut wait, the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), so \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, the total coefficient would be \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). But let me check that again. Alternatively, maybe the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms, which would mean that we need to find the term where \\(c^0\\) is present. So, in that case, we need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) and then multiply it by 6.\n\nWait, that makes more sense. Because if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), but in the product, \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by various powers of \\(c\\). However, if the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) irrespective of \\(c\\), then it's actually an infinite number of terms, but that doesn't make sense. So, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of the term \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by the constant term in the second expansion.\n\nWait, but the problem didn't specify anything about \\(c\\), so maybe it's only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, which would include all possible powers of \\(c\\). But that would mean summing all the coefficients from the second expansion, which is 64, and then multiplying by 6, giving 384. But that seems too large, and I'm not sure if that's what is intended.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and the second part doesn't affect it because it's multiplied by terms involving \\(c\\). But that doesn't make sense because when you multiply two expressions, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion.\n\nWait, but let me think about how the product works. If I have \\( (a + b)^4 \\) expanded as \\( \\sum_{k=0}^4 \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k} b^k \\) and \\( \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 \\) expanded as \\( \\sum_{m=0}^6 \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^6 \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m} \\).\n\nSo, when I multiply these two expansions together, I get:\n\n\\[\n\\left( \\sum_{k=0}^4 \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k} b^k \\right) \\left( \\sum_{m=0}^6 \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m} \\right)\n\\]\n\nSo, each term in the product is \\( \\dbinom{4}{k} \\dbinom{6}{m} a^{4 - k} b^k c^{6 - 2m} \\).\n\nNow, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, we need to find all terms where \\(a^{4 - k} = a^2\\) and \\(b^k = b^2\\). That means \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). So, \\(k = 2\\). So, the coefficient from the first part is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n\nNow, for each such term, we also have \\(c^{6 - 2m}\\). The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but it doesn't specify anything about \\(c\\). So, does that mean we need to consider all possible exponents of \\(c\\), or only the constant term? I think it's the former because the problem doesn't specify. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by 6. Because each term in the second expansion, when multiplied by \\(6a^2b^2\\), gives a term with \\(a^2b^2\\) and some power of \\(c\\). So, the total coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) across all \\(c\\) terms is \\(6 \\times\\) (sum of coefficients in the second expansion).\n\nThe sum of the coefficients in the second expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the total coefficient is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\nWait, but I'm not sure if that's correct because the problem might only be asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, which would include all possible powers of \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient is indeed 384. Alternatively, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), then we need to find the constant term in the second expansion and multiply it by 6.\n\nLet me check that. The constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) occurs when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. So, \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which gives \\(m = 3\\). The coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) would be \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nWait, so which is it? The problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\". If it's asking for the coefficient regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then it's 384. If it's asking for the coefficient when \\(c\\) is also at a specific power, say zero, then it's 120. But the problem didn't specify anything about \\(c\\), so I think it's more likely that it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times any power of \\(c\\), which would be 384.\n\nBut I'm a bit confused because in the problem statement, it's written as \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), and the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is separate from \\(c\\). So, perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and the second part doesn't affect it because it's multiplied by terms involving \\(c\\). But that doesn't make sense because when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficients combine.\n\nWait, no, that's not correct. When you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion. So, that would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, giving 384.\n\nBut let me think again. Suppose I have two polynomials, P(a,b) and Q(c). Then, the product P(a,b) * Q(c) would have terms where each term in P is multiplied by each term in Q. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in P(a,b) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in Q(c). Because each term in Q(c) is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), so the total coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) across all terms in Q(c) would be the sum of coefficients in Q(c) times the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in P(a,b).\n\nYes, that makes sense. So, in this case, the sum of coefficients in Q(c) is 64, so the total coefficient would be 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nBut let me verify this with a simpler example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^1 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). The expansion would be \\((a + b)(c + 1/c) = a c + a/c + b c + b/c\\). The coefficient of \\(a\\) in this product would be the coefficient of \\(a\\) in the first part, which is 1, multiplied by the sum of coefficients in the second part, which is 2 (since \\(c + 1/c\\) evaluated at \\(c=1\\) is 2). So, the coefficient of \\(a\\) would be 1 * 2 = 2, which is correct because in the expansion, \\(a\\) appears as \\(a c\\) and \\(a/c\\), each with coefficient 1, so total coefficient is 2.\n\nSimilarly, in our problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, giving 384.\n\nWait, but in the example, the coefficient of \\(a\\) is 2, which is the sum of coefficients in the second expansion times the coefficient of \\(a\\) in the first. So, applying that logic here, yes, it's 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem had asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion, which is 20, giving 120.\n\nBut since the problem didn't specify anything about \\(c\\), I think it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), which would be 384.\n\nWait, but let me check the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" It doesn't mention \\(c\\), so perhaps it's just 6, because the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6, and the second part is multiplied by that term, but since we're only asked about \\(a^2b^2\\), the \\(c\\) terms don't affect it. But that can't be right because when you multiply, the coefficients do combine.\n\nWait, no, that's not correct. When you multiply two expressions, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, which includes various powers of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by 6. Therefore, it's 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nBut I'm still a bit unsure because sometimes problems like this might only consider the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by the constant term in the second expansion, giving 120. But in the absence of specific information about \\(c\\), I think the correct interpretation is that the coefficient is 384.\n\nWait, but let me think differently. Maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, meaning that \\(c\\) must also be present in such a way that the term is \\(a^2b^2\\) times some power of \\(c\\). But the problem didn't specify any power for \\(c\\), so it's ambiguous. However, in most problems like this, when they ask for the coefficient of a term involving multiple variables, they usually mean the term where all those variables are present with the specified exponents, and the other variables can be anything. But in this case, since \\(c\\) is another variable, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by various powers of \\(c\\), so the coefficient would be the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by 6.\n\nWait, but perhaps I'm overcomplicating again. Let me try to think about it as a product of two independent expansions. The first expansion contributes \\(6a^2b^2\\), and the second expansion contributes various terms involving \\(c\\). So, when you multiply them, \\(6a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, resulting in terms like \\(6a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(6a^2b^2c^4\\), etc. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by 6, because each term in the second expansion contributes to a term with \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by a power of \\(c\\). Therefore, the total coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem had asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it would be 6 * 20 = 120. But since it's just \\(a^2b^2\\), I think it's 384.\n\nWait, but let me think about how the problem is phrased. It says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)\". So, in the entire product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will appear multiplied by various powers of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by 6. So, 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nBut to confirm, let me think about the definition. The coefficient of a term in a product is the sum of all coefficients from the second polynomial multiplied by the coefficient of that term in the first polynomial. So, yes, that would be 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is 384.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought about the constant term, which is 20, and 6 * 20 = 120. But that would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). Since the problem didn't specify \\(c\\), I think it's asking for the total coefficient across all powers of \\(c\\), which is 384.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and the second part is irrelevant because it's multiplied by terms involving \\(c\\). But that doesn't make sense because when you multiply, the coefficients combine.\n\nWait, no, that's not correct. When you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion.\n\nSo, yes, 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nTherefore, after all this thinking, I believe the coefficient is 384.\n\nWait, but I'm going to check this with a different approach. Let me compute the product step by step.\n\nFirst, \\((a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\).\n\nSecond, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15c^{-2} + 6c^{-4} + c^{-6}\\).\n\nNow, when I multiply these two, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion:\n\n- \\(6a^2b^2 \\times c^6 = 6a^2b^2c^6\\)\n- \\(6a^2b^2 \\times 6c^4 = 36a^2b^2c^4\\)\n- \\(6a^2b^2 \\times 15c^2 = 90a^2b^2c^2\\)\n- \\(6a^2b^2 \\times 20 = 120a^2b^2\\)\n- \\(6a^2b^2 \\times 15c^{-2} = 90a^2b^2c^{-2}\\)\n- \\(6a^2b^2 \\times 6c^{-4} = 36a^2b^2c^{-4}\\)\n- \\(6a^2b^2 \\times c^{-6} = 6a^2b^2c^{-6}\\)\n\nSo, all these terms have \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by different powers of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the sum of all the coefficients from these terms. That is:\n\n6 (from c^6) + 36 (from c^4) + 90 (from c^2) + 120 (from c^0) + 90 (from c^{-2}) + 36 (from c^{-4}) + 6 (from c^{-6}).\n\nAdding these up: 6 + 36 = 42; 42 + 90 = 132; 132 + 120 = 252; 252 + 90 = 342; 342 + 36 = 378; 378 + 6 = 384.\n\nYes, that confirms it. The total coefficient is 384.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem had asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), it would have been 120, which is just the term where \\(c\\) cancels out. But since it's just \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\), the coefficient is 384.\n\nSo, after all that, I'm confident that the coefficient is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is found by expanding each part separately and then combining the results. \n\n1. Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is 6.\n2. Recognize that the entire expression is a product, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion.\n3. The sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), giving \\(2^6 = 64\\).\n4. Multiply 6 by 64 to get the total coefficient, which is 384.\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{384}\\)."

    "text": " \n\nFirst, I think I should expand each part separately and then see how they combine. The expression has two parts multiplied together: \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Since I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), maybe I don't need to worry about the \\(c\\) terms because \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\). That might simplify things.\n\nLet me start with the first part: \\((a + b)^4\\). I remember that when expanding a binomial like \\((x + y)^n\\), the coefficients can be found using the binomial theorem, which states that each term is of the form \\(\\dbinom{n}{k}x^{n - k}y^k\\). So, for \\((a + b)^4\\), each term will be \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}a^{4 - k}b^k\\) where \\(k\\) ranges from 0 to 4.\n\nI need the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2. That means I need \\(a^2b^2\\), so let me find the corresponding coefficient. Here, \\(4 - k = 2\\), which means \\(k = 2\\). So the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\).\n\nCalculating \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\), that's \\(\\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\nNow, looking at the second part: \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I think I need to expand this as well, but since the problem is only asking about the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), maybe the \\(c\\) terms don't affect this part. Wait, actually, since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), the entire expression \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) will just be a polynomial in \\(c\\), and when multiplied by \\((a + b)^4\\), it will contribute a scalar multiple to each term in \\((a + b)^4\\).\n\nSo, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I can compute the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiply it by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, actually, no. Because when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second. But since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), the only way \\(a^2b^2\\) can appear in the product is by taking the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part and multiplying it by the constant term (if any) from the second part.\n\nWait, is that right? Let me think again. The second part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which when expanded, will have terms involving \\(c^k\\) where \\(k\\) ranges from -6 to 6 in steps of 2, I think. Because each term in the expansion is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\). So the exponents of \\(c\\) will be even numbers from -6 to 6.\n\nBut since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), that would mean we need to find the term in the second expansion where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, i.e., the constant term. Because when we multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by this constant term, we get a term that's just a multiple of \\(a^2b^2\\), without any \\(c\\) involved.\n\nSo, to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), I need to find the value of \\(m\\) such that the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. So, from the exponent \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), solving for \\(m\\):\n\n\\(6 - 2m = 0\\)\n\n\\(2m = 6\\)\n\n\\(m = 3\\)\n\nSo the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}c^{0} = \\dbinom{6}{3}\\).\n\nCalculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6*6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). So the constant term is 20.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the coefficient from the first part (which is 6) multiplied by the constant term from the second part (which is 20). So 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, let me double-check that. So, \\((a + b)^4\\) gives \\(a^2b^2\\) with coefficient 6, and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) gives a constant term 20, so when multiplied together, the coefficient becomes 6 * 20 = 120. That seems right.\n\nBut just to make sure I didn't make any mistakes, let me go through it again.\n\nFirst part: \\((a + b)^4\\). The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the binomial expansion where we choose 2 a's and 2 b's. The number of ways is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\), which is 6. So that's correct.\n\nSecond part: \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). We need the constant term, which occurs when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. So, in the expansion, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - m} \\times \\left(1/c\\right)^m = \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\). Setting \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Thus, the term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\), which is 20. That's correct.\n\nMultiplying the two coefficients: 6 * 20 = 120. So the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120.\n\nI don't think I made any mistakes here. So I'm confident that the answer is 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break down the problem into two parts: expanding \\((a + b)^4\\) and finding the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\n1. **Expanding \\((a + b)^4\\):**\n   Using the binomial theorem, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is given by:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2}a^2b^2\n   \\]\n   Calculating the binomial coefficient:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\n   \\]\n   So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\n2. **Finding the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   Using the binomial theorem, each term in the expansion is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\n   \\]\n   We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero:\n   \\[\n   6 - 2m = 0 \\implies m = 3\n   \\]\n   The constant term is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\n   \\]\n\n3. **Combining the results:**\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficients from the two parts:\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 20 = 120\n   \\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}."

So, does that mean I need to consider terms from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) as well? Or is the \\(a^2b^2\\) term independent of \\(c\\)?\n\nHmm, I think I might have misunderstood the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, it's just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, when we multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will be multiplied by every term in the second expansion. But since the problem only asks for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), perhaps we just need to consider the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and then multiply it by the entire second expansion, but since the second expansion has terms with \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), which are different variables, they don't affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). \n\nWait, that doesn't make sense. Because when you multiply two expressions, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second part, which are powers of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would actually be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire second expression. But the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so maybe it's just 6 multiplied by the entire second expression, but that would give a term with \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), which isn't a constant. Hmm, I'm confused now.\n\nWait, maybe I misread the problem. Let me check again: it says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\". So, perhaps the variables involved are \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\), and we're looking for the coefficient of the term where \\(a\\) is squared, \\(b\\) is squared, and \\(c\\) is raised to some power, but the problem is only asking for the coefficient, not specifying anything about \\(c\\). So, maybe the coefficient is actually the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and the entire second part, since each term in the second part will multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) where \\(k\\) ranges from -6 to 6. But the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, maybe the answer is the coefficient 6 multiplied by the entire second expression. But that would be a polynomial in \\(c\\), not a single coefficient. \n\nWait, that doesn't seem right. Maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think again. The problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so perhaps it's considering only the terms where \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are squared, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients from the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because each term in the second expansion will multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term, contributing to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. \n\nWait, but no, because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, each term will have a different power of \\(c\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would actually be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire second expansion. But that would mean the coefficient isn't a single number but a polynomial in \\(c\\). So, maybe the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without considering \\(c\\), which would mean it's just 6. But that seems too simple.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some specific \\(k\\), but it's not specified. Wait, the problem just says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", so maybe it's considering the coefficient regardless of the power of \\(c\\), which would mean that the coefficient is 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would make the coefficient a polynomial, which doesn't make sense because the question is asking for a numerical coefficient.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Maybe the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, so the coefficient would be the product of the coefficients from each part. Let me think: when you multiply two expressions, the coefficient of a specific term is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each expression. But in this case, the first expression only has terms with \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the second has terms with \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, when you multiply them, the terms will involve both \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would come from multiplying the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first part by each term in the second part. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would actually be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire second part, which is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient isn't a single number but a polynomial. So, maybe the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and that's it. But that seems too straightforward, and I feel like I'm missing something.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider that when you multiply the two expressions, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second part, which are terms like \\(c^6\\), \\(6c^4\\), \\(15c^2\\), \\(20\\), \\(15c^{-2}\\), \\(6c^{-4}\\), and \\(c^{-6}\\). So, each of these will contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for different \\(k\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would only consider the term where \\(c^k\\) is such that the entire term is \\(a^2b^2\\), but that's impossible because the second part introduces \\(c\\) terms. So, actually, there is no term in the product that is just \\(a^2b^2\\); instead, each term will have \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by some power of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is actually the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) multiplied by 6, because each term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But that would mean the coefficient isn't a single number but a polynomial in \\(c\\). \n\nWait, but the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so maybe it's considering that the term \\(a^2b^2\\) can be multiplied by any power of \\(c\\), and thus the coefficient would be the sum of all the coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by 6. But that doesn't make sense because the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would actually be 6 times the entire second expansion, which is a polynomial, not a single coefficient.\n\nI'm getting confused here. Maybe I should look at the problem differently. Perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the powers of \\(c\\), which would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion. But the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which would give \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). So, the coefficient would be 6 * 64 = 384. But wait, that might not be correct because the second expansion is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), and when you set \\(c = 1\\), it's 64, but that's the sum of the coefficients, which is correct. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 * 64 = 384. But I'm not sure if that's the right approach.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and that's it. But that seems too simple, and I feel like I'm missing something because the second part is also raised to the 6th power.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, but since \\(c\\) and \\(a\\), \\(b\\) are independent variables, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient in the first part multiplied by the entire second expansion. But that would mean the coefficient isn't a single number but a polynomial. So, maybe the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and that's it.\n\nWait, but that doesn't make sense because the problem includes both \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, considering all possible terms, but since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are different variables, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually be the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the entire second part. So, the coefficient would be 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial, not a single coefficient. Therefore, perhaps the problem is miswritten, or I'm misinterpreting it.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of the power of \\(c\\), which would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion. Since the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\(2^6 = 64\\). So, the coefficient would be 6 * 64 = 384. But I'm not sure if that's the correct approach because the problem might be asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, considering all possible powers of \\(c\\), which would indeed be 6 times the entire second expansion, but that's a polynomial, not a single coefficient.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and that's it. But that seems too simple, and I feel like I'm missing something because the second part is also there.\n\nWait, maybe I should consider that the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which would require considering the entire expansion. So, let me try to approach it differently.\n\nThe entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). To find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I need to consider all terms in the product where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2 and 2, respectively. Since the first part only has \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the second part has \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), the terms in the product will have the form \\(a^2b^2 \\times c^k\\) where \\(k\\) can be from -6 to 6. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would actually be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire second expansion. So, the coefficient would be 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial, not a single coefficient.\n\nBut the problem is asking for \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", which suggests it's looking for a numerical coefficient, not a polynomial. Therefore, perhaps the problem is only considering the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and that's the answer. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be the term where \\(c\\) is raised to the zero power, i.e., 1. In that case, I would need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is the middle term, and then multiply it by 6.\n\nWait, that makes sense. So, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is the term where \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are squared and \\(c\\) is to the zero power. So, to find that, I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and then multiply it by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part, which is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\).\n\nSo, let me calculate the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem again, the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is:\n\n\\[\n\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(1/c\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n\\]\n\nWe need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so we set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire product is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nWait, that seems more reasonable. So, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. Alternatively, if the problem is indeed asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then it would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but that's a polynomial. Since the problem is asking for \"the coefficient\", it's more likely that it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nLet me double-check my reasoning. The first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), has a term \\(6a^2b^2\\). The second part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), has a term with coefficient 20 when \\(c^0\\). So, when we multiply these two, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by 20, resulting in \\(6 \\times 20 a^2b^2c^0 = 120a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient is 120.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So, the final answer should be 120.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break down the problem into two parts:\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\dbinom{4}{0}a^4 + \\dbinom{4}{1}a^3b + \\dbinom{4}{2}a^2b^2 + \\dbinom{4}{3}ab^3 + \\dbinom{4}{4}b^4\n   \\]\n   Simplifying the coefficients:\n   \\[\n   1 \\cdot a^4 + 4 \\cdot a^3b + 6 \\cdot a^2b^2 + 4 \\cdot ab^3 + 1 \\cdot b^4\n   \\]\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6.\n\n2. **Find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   Using the binomial theorem:\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n   \\]\n   We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0:\n   \\[\n   6 - 2k = 0 \\implies k = 3\n   \\]\n   The coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n\n3. **Multiply the coefficients from both parts:**\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is:\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 20 = 120\n   \\]\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

    "text": " \n\nFirst, I know that when you expand a binomial like \\((a + b)^n\\), you can use the binomial theorem. The binomial theorem says that each term in the expansion is of the form \\(\\dbinom{n}{k}a^{n - k}b^k\\), where \\(k\\) goes from 0 to \\(n\\). So, maybe I can apply that here for the \\((a + b)^4\\) part.\n\nLet me write that out. The expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) would be:\n\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^{k}\n\\]\n\nSo, the general term is \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}a^{4 - k}b^{k}\\). Now, I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). That means I need the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2. So, \\(4 - k = 2\\) for \\(a\\), which means \\(k = 2\\). So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\).\n\nCalculating that, \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient from the \\((a + b)^4\\) part is 6.\n\nNow, the other part of the expression is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I need to figure out how this part affects the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, but \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are in the first part, and \\(c\\) is in the second part. So, the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from those involving \\(c\\). That means when I multiply the two expansions together, the coefficients for the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms don't directly affect the coefficients for the \\(c\\) terms. So, perhaps the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just 6 times whatever the coefficient is in the second part for the \\(c\\) terms? Wait, no, that doesn't make sense because the \\(c\\) terms are separate variables. Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating this.\n\nWait, actually, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of what's happening with \\(c\\). So, perhaps I'm only concerned with the part involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the part with \\(c\\) just gets multiplied by 1, or maybe it's a constant. Wait, no, that can't be right because \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) will have its own terms, but since we're only looking for \\(a^2b^2\\), the \\(c\\) terms might not affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Hmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem.\n\nWait, let me read the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, the expression is the product of two binomial expansions. So, when you expand both, each term in the first expansion gets multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are independent of those involving \\(c\\). So, when you multiply them, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the entire second part's expansion, but since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\), maybe it's just 6 times whatever the entire second part's expansion is, but that doesn't make sense because the second part is separate.\n\nWait, no, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. The problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so perhaps the part involving \\(c\\) doesn't affect it. So, maybe the coefficient is just 6, from the first part, and the second part is just a constant factor, so when you multiply, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times whatever the entire second part is, but that's not right because the second part is also a sum of terms with different powers of \\(c\\).\n\nWait, perhaps the question is just to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating \\(c\\) as a variable, but since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient would just be the coefficient from the first part, multiplied by the entire second part's expansion evaluated at whatever terms. But that doesn't make sense because the second part is an expansion with multiple terms, so I think I'm making a mistake here.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think again. The problem is \\((a + b)^4\\) times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when you expand both, you have terms like \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}a^{4 - k}b^{k}\\) times \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - m}(1/c)^m\\). So, each term is \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}\\dbinom{6}{m} a^{4 - k}b^{k}c^{6 - 2m}\\).\n\nNow, since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), that would correspond to \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\), so \\(k = 2\\), and the coefficient from the first part is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Now, the term from the second part is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\). But since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), does that mean we need to consider all possible \\(m\\) and sum up the coefficients? Wait, no, because \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term in the product, and each term in the product is a combination of terms from both expansions. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the sum over all \\(m\\) of \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\dbinom{6}{m}\\), because for each \\(m\\), we have a term \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by \\(c^{6 - 2m}\\), but since the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\), maybe it's actually the sum of all coefficients from the second part multiplied by the coefficient from the first part.\n\nWait, but that can't be right because the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would then be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. But the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), so \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). So, would the coefficient be 6 * 64 = 384? That seems high, but maybe that's correct.\n\nWait, let me think again. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). When you expand this, each term is of the form \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}a^{4 - k}b^{k} \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - m}(1/c)^m\\). So, each term is \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}\\dbinom{6}{m} a^{4 - k}b^{k}c^{6 - 2m}\\).\n\nNow, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would require \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\), so \\(k = 2\\). So, the coefficient from the first part is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Now, for each \\(m\\) in the second part, we have a term \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the sum over all \\(m\\) from 0 to 6 of \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\dbinom{6}{m}\\). But that would be 6 times the sum of \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\) from \\(m = 0\\) to \\(6\\), which is 6 * 2^6 = 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nWait, but that seems like a lot. Let me check that. Alternatively, maybe I'm supposed to consider that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just 6, and the rest of the terms are multiplied by different powers of \\(c\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 times the entire expansion of the second part. But that would mean the coefficient is a sum, but that doesn't make sense because coefficients are scalars, not polynomials. So, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient would be the sum of all possible products where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any term from the second expansion. So, that would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 2^6 = 384. \n\nBut let me think again. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), which would be the constant term in the second expansion. So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). \n\nWait, that might make more sense. Because if you're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), without any \\(c\\) terms, then you need to consider the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. So, let's explore that.\n\nIn \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - m}(1/c)^m = \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, we want the exponent of \\(c\\) to be zero, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which implies \\(m = 3\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the coefficient from the second part where \\(c^0\\), which is 20. So, 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, that seems more reasonable. So, perhaps I was overcomplicating it before by considering all terms, but actually, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), but since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term, and the entire expression is a product, the coefficient would be the product of the coefficients from each part where the exponents of \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) match what's needed. So, in this case, since we're looking for \\(a^2b^2\\), we don't care about the exponent of \\(c\\), but actually, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by all possible terms from the second expansion, so the coefficient would be the sum over all \\(m\\) of \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\dbinom{6}{m}\\). But that would be 6 * 2^6 = 384, as before.\n\nBut now I'm confused because depending on how I interpret the problem, I get two different answers: 120 and 384. Let me try to clarify the problem statement again. It says, \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, it's the coefficient of the term \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, that would mean that for each term in the expansion, if it has \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of what power of \\(c\\) it's multiplied by, we sum all those coefficients together. So, that would be the sum over all \\(m\\) from 0 to 6 of \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\dbinom{6}{m}\\), which is 6 * (sum from m=0 to 6 of \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\)) = 6 * 2^6 = 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nBut wait, another way to think about it is that the entire expression is a product of two polynomials, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the product of the coefficients from each part where the exponents add up to \\(a^2b^2\\), but since the second part doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), the coefficient from the second part is just 1, but that doesn't seem right because the second part is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is a separate expansion.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the product of \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part and any term from the second part, so the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of the second part. But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a coefficient, which is a scalar.\n\nWait, I think I'm getting confused because the problem is in two variables, but the question is only about the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in other words, in the entire expansion, every term that has \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by any power of \\(c\\) would contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient would be the sum of all such contributions, which would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 2^6 = 384.\n\nBut wait, that would mean the coefficient is 384, but I'm not sure if that's the correct interpretation. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some \\(k\\), but it's just \\(a^2b^2\\), so I think it's asking for the coefficient regardless of \\(c\\), which would mean summing over all possible \\(c\\) terms. So, the answer would be 384.\n\nBut earlier, I thought that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6, and that's it, but that seems too simplistic because the second part of the expression is also being multiplied. So, perhaps the correct approach is to consider that the entire coefficient is the product of the coefficients from each part, but since the second part is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is a separate expansion, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the entire expansion of the second part, which would mean that the coefficient is a sum over all terms, but that can't be right because coefficients are scalars.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating again. Let me try another approach. Let me consider that the entire expression is a product of two polynomials, one in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the other in \\(c\\). So, when you multiply them, the coefficients of the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are independent of the coefficients involving \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the entire second part's expansion, which is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a coefficient, not a polynomial.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is miswritten, and it's supposed to be \\((a + b + c + 1/c)^{10}\\) or something like that, but as it stands, it's \\((a + b)^4\\) times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, perhaps the problem is indeed asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 2^6 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\). In that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion, which is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nI think I need to clarify which interpretation is correct. Let me check the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" It doesn't specify any particular power of \\(c\\), so I think it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). That would mean summing over all possible powers of \\(c\\), so the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nBut I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable, then the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of the second part, which is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But since the problem is asking for a coefficient, which is a scalar, I think the intended interpretation is that we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), so the answer is 384.\n\nWait, but let me check the alternative approach. Let's expand both parts separately and then consider the product. The expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is:\n\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\n\\]\n\nAnd the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is:\n\n\\[\n\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - m}\\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\n\\]\n\nSo, when you multiply these two expansions together, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, resulting in terms like \\(6a^2b^2 \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, each of these terms has \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by some power of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by 6. So, that would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion.\n\nThe sum of the coefficients in the second expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), so \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, that makes sense now. So, the coefficient is 384. So, I think that's the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{384}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem for each part separately and then combine the results.\n\n1. **Expanding \\((a + b)^4\\)**:\n   Using the binomial theorem, the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is:\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^{k}\n   \\]\n   The term involving \\(a^2b^2\\) occurs when \\(k = 2\\), which gives:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\n   \\]\n   So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) from this part is 6.\n\n2. **Considering the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)**:\n   The expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is:\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n   \\]\n   The sum of all coefficients in this expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives:\n   \\[\n   (1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\n   \\]\n\n3. **Combining the results**:\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficient from the first part and the sum of the coefficients from the second part. Therefore, the coefficient is:\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 64 = 384\n   \\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{384}\\)."

    "text": " \n\nFirst, I remember that when you have an expression like \\((a + b)^n\\), you can expand it using the binomial theorem. The binomial theorem says that \\((a + b)^n = \\sum_{k=0}^{n} \\dbinom{n}{k} a^{n - k} b^k\\). So, maybe I can apply that here.\n\nIn this case, the expression is \\((a + b)^4\\), so \\(n = 4\\). I'm looking for the term where \\(a^2b^2\\). So, that would be when the exponent on \\(a\\) is 2 and the exponent on \\(b\\) is 2. Let me see, since \\(a^{4 - k}b^k\\), so if \\(4 - k = 2\\), then \\(k = 2\\). So, the term would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} a^2b^2\\).\n\nCalculating \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\), that's \\(\\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. \n\nBut wait, the original problem is \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I also have this other part: \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I need to consider that as well because the entire expression is the product of these two binomials.\n\nHowever, since I'm only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I realize that the \\(c\\) terms don't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. So, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will be multiplied by every term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term in the first part, the second part can contribute any term, but since it's multiplied, the overall term would be \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by some term involving \\(c\\).\n\nWait, but the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, does that mean that the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any term from the second binomial, but since we're only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), perhaps we can consider that the coefficient will be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't sound right because when you multiply two expressions, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expression. But wait, that might not be correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\), perhaps the coefficient is just 6, because when you multiply by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in that expansion will just add to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times some \\(c\\) term. But wait, no, that's not right because each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is of the form \\(c^k\\) or \\(c^{-k}\\), so when you multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), you get terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2c^{-k}\\). But the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), without considering the \\(c\\) terms. Hmm, that seems confusing.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, perhaps the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is considered in the entire expression, which includes the \\(c\\) terms. So, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't sound right because each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), so the total coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second binomial expansion.\n\nWait, but that's not correct because when you expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the sum of all its coefficients is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of all coefficients is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 * 64 = 384. But that seems too high, and I'm not sure if that's the correct approach.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it, and the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, perhaps the answer is just 6, because the \\(c\\) terms don't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) coefficients. But that seems too simplistic, and I think the problem is expecting me to consider the entire expansion.\n\nWait, perhaps I should think of the entire expression as a product of two expansions, and the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be present in the first part, and in the second part, any term would be multiplied by it, but since the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, then the coefficient would indeed be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. So, the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is when \\(c = 1\\), which is \\(2^6 = 64\\). So, 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nBut let me verify this. Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first part, and when multiplied by any term from the second part, the coefficient is 6 times the coefficient of each term in the second part. But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without specifying any particular \\(c\\) term, perhaps it's considering all possible \\(c\\) terms, so the coefficient would indeed be 6 times the sum of coefficients in the second part, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but I'm not sure. Let me think again. If the problem had been \\((a + b)^4 (c + 1/c)^6\\), and it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), then perhaps it's considering that \\(a^2b^2\\) can be multiplied by any term from the second expansion, so the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. But that seems a bit odd because usually, when you're asked for the coefficient of a specific term, you might need more context. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, so it's just 6.\n\nWait, but that doesn't make sense because the entire expression is a product, so each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nBut I'm not entirely confident. Let me try another approach. Let's consider expanding both parts separately.\n\nFirst, \\((a + b)^4\\) expanded is \\(a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\).\n\nThen, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) can be expanded using the binomial theorem as \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\).\n\nSo, when you multiply these two expansions together, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, which are \\(c^{6 - 2k}\\) for \\(k = 0\\) to \\(6\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be \\(6 \\times \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k}\\), because each term in the second expansion has a coefficient of \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}\\), and they are all multiplied by 6 from the first expansion.\n\nBut \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the coefficient would be \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\nWait, that seems correct. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 384.\n\nBut let me check if I'm interpreting the problem correctly. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, in the entire expansion, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be present multiplied by each term from the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem had asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some specific \\(k\\), then we would have to compute it differently, but since it's just \\(a^2b^2\\), without any \\(c\\) terms, I think the correct approach is to consider that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 384.\n\nWait, but another thought: maybe the problem is intended to consider that \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), so perhaps the coefficient is 6, because the other terms involve \\(c\\). But that doesn't make sense because when you multiply by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), you can't have a term without \\(c\\). So, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), which would mean that it's 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 384.\n\nYes, I think that's correct. So, the coefficient is 384.\n\nWait, but let me make sure. Let me compute the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). The sum of coefficients is when \\(c = 1\\), so \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, yes, that's correct. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nSo, I think the answer is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. When multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 64, the result is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n\\boxed{384}"

So, maybe I can apply that here.\n\nIn this problem, the first part is \\((a + b)^4\\), so let me expand that first. Using the binomial theorem, each term in the expansion will be \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^{k}\\) where \\(k\\) ranges from 0 to 4. \n\nI need the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, let me see what value of \\(k\\) gives me \\(a^2b^2\\). Since \\(a^{4 - k}b^{k}\\), I set \\(4 - k = 2\\) for \\(a^2\\), which means \\(k = 2\\). So, the term is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} a^2b^2\\). \n\nCalculating \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\), which is \\(\\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\nWait, but the original expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I think I need to consider the entire expression, not just \\((a + b)^4\\). \n\nHmm, so maybe the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, that doesn't seem right because the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) shouldn't depend on \\(c\\) terms. \n\nWait, no, actually, the question is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\). So, maybe I just need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and then consider how it interacts with the other part.\n\nWait, but actually, when you multiply two expressions, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression. So, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nBut since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't include \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), the only way that could happen is if the term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is a constant term, i.e., the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. Because if we multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by a term with \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), we would get terms like \\(a^2b^2c\\) or \\(a^2b^2/c\\), which aren't just \\(a^2b^2\\).\n\nSo, to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, we need to take the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and multiply it by the coefficient of the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nTherefore, I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nLet me think about how to expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Again, using the binomial theorem, each term will be \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\).\n\nWe need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). \n\nSo, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} c^{0} = \\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n\nTherefore, the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20.\n\nNow, going back to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) and the constant term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nSo, that would be \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nWait, but let me double-check that. So, when we multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term is 6a\u00b2b\u00b2, and it's multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But since we only want the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), we have to take the part where the second expansion contributes a term that's just a constant, i.e., the constant term. \n\nSo, yes, that means 6 * 20 = 120 is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression.\n\nI think that's correct.

Hmm, I'm not sure yet, but let's start with the first part.\n\nStarting with \\((a + b)^4\\), I know the binomial theorem states that \\((x + y)^n = \\sum_{k=0}^{n} \\dbinom{n}{k} x^{n - k} y^{k}\\). So applying this to \\((a + b)^4\\), each term will be \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k} b^{k}\\) where \\(k\\) goes from 0 to 4. \n\nSince we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), that means we need the term where \\(a\\) is squared and \\(b\\) is squared. So in the binomial expansion, \\(a^{4 - k} b^{k}\\) should equal \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). \n\nCalculating the binomial coefficient for \\(k = 2\\), we get \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Let me compute that: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So the coefficient from the \\((a + b)^4\\) part is 6.\n\nNow, moving on to the second part: \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Again, using the binomial theorem, this expansion will have terms \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\), where \\(m\\) ranges from 0 to 6. \n\nLet me simplify each term. \\(\\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = c^{-m}\\), so each term becomes \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m} = \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). \n\nNow, I'm trying to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but this part is in terms of \\(c\\). Wait a minute, so maybe I don't need to worry about the \\(c\\) terms when looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)? Because \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), right? So perhaps the \\(c\\) terms just contribute a factor, but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), the \\(c\\) part can be treated as a constant multiplier.\n\nBut let me think again. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So when we expand both, we'll have a product of two polynomials. Each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since we're only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), maybe we can treat the \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) part as a single term, or perhaps find the constant term (the term without \\(c\\)) in that expansion because multiplying by that won't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms.\n\nWait, that makes sense. Because if I have \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part, and I multiply it by a term from the second part that has \\(c\\) raised to some power, unless that power is zero, the resulting term will have \\(c\\) in it, which isn't part of \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the only way \\(a^2b^2\\) can appear in the product is if we multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by the constant term (the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero) from the second expansion.\n\nSo, I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). That is, the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. \n\nFrom earlier, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, we need \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). \n\nSo, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} c^{0} = \\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). Wait, no, that can't be right. Let me compute it again. \n\nWait, 6! is 720, 3! is 6, so 720 divided by (6 times 6) is 720/36, which is indeed 20. So the constant term is 20.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficient from the first part and the constant term from the second part. So that's 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the second part), which is 6 \u00d7 20 = 120.\n\nWait, let me just make sure I didn't make any mistakes here. So, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, correct. In \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the constant term is when \\(m = 3\\), which gives \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\), correct. So 6 \u00d7 20 is indeed 120. \n\nWait, but hold on a second. Is there any chance that I'm missing something here? Because sometimes when you have products of polynomials, you have to consider cross terms, but in this case, since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and the other part is a constant (with respect to \\(a\\) and \\(b\\)), I think this approach is correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of the entire expression as a product of two polynomials and consider that each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second. But since the second polynomial's terms only involve \\(c\\), which doesn't interact with \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial multiplied by the entire second polynomial. But wait, no, that's not quite right because the second polynomial is being multiplied as a whole, but since we're looking for terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present, and the second polynomial doesn't have any \\(a\\) or \\(b\\) terms, the only way \\(a^2b^2\\) can appear in the product is if we take the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first polynomial and multiply it by the constant term from the second polynomial. So yes, that's exactly what I did before.\n\nTherefore, I think my approach is correct, and the coefficient is indeed 120.\n\nWait, but just to be thorough, let me consider if there's any other way that \\(a^2b^2\\) could appear. Suppose, for example, that the second polynomial had terms with \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), but in this case, it's only \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), so no, that's not possible. So, yes, the only contribution to \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the product of \\(a^2b^2\\) and the constant term in the second polynomial.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the coefficient is 6 \u00d7 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break down the problem into two parts using the binomial theorem.\n\n1. **Expanding \\((a + b)^4\\):**\n   Using the binomial theorem, the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is given by:\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k} b^{k}\n   \\]\n   We need the term where \\(a^2b^2\\), which occurs when \\(k = 2\\). The coefficient is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\n   \\]\n\n2. **Expanding \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   Using the binomial theorem, the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is given by:\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n   \\]\n   We need the constant term (where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero). This occurs when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which gives \\(m = 3\\). The coefficient is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\n   \\]\n\n3. **Combining the results:**\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is the product of the coefficients from each part:\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 20 = 120\n   \\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

So, maybe I can apply that here for the \\((a + b)^4\\) part.\n\nWait, but the problem is asking specifically for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, I think I should focus on the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2. Let me write that down. \n\nIn the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\), the general term is \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^{k}\\). I need the term where \\(a^2b^2\\), so that would be when \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). Let me check: \\(4 - 2 = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\), so yes, that's the term. The coefficient for this term would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\).\n\nCalculating that, \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) is \\(\\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6. \n\nBut wait, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I think the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would just be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because when you multiply, the terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) won't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. So, I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nAlright, let me focus on \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Again, using the binomial theorem, this would be \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying that, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\times c^{-m} = \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\).\n\nI need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, because that would be the constant term. So, I set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\) and solve for \\(m\\). That gives \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). \n\nSo, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). Wait, that doesn't seem right. Let me check again. \n\nWait, 6! is 720, 3! is 6, so 720 divided by (6 times 6) is 720/36, which is indeed 20. So, the constant term is 20.\n\nNow, going back to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficients from each part. So, from \\((a + b)^4\\), it's 6, and from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the constant term is 20. So, multiplying these together, 6 times 20 is 120.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. Since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), when I multiply the two expansions, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will come from the first part, and any term from the second part will be multiplied by it. But since I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), the other part must contribute a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), which is the constant term. So, yes, I think 120 is the correct coefficient.\n\nWait, but let me just double-check my binomial coefficients to be sure I didn't make a mistake. \n\nFor \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\), which is indeed 6. \n\nFor \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term where \\(c\\) cancels out is when \\(m = 3\\), giving \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). \n\nSo, 6 times 20 is 120. So, I think that's correct.\n\nI don't see any mistakes in my reasoning, so I think the coefficient is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is found by first determining the coefficient in \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem, which is 6.

Or is there more to it?\n\nWait, no, actually, the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of what happens with \\(c\\). So, in other words, when we multiply the two expressions, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by every term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and not any specific term in \\(c\\), perhaps the coefficient remains 6, and the rest is multiplied by the sum over all terms in the second expression.\n\nBut that doesn't seem right because the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so maybe it's 6 times the entire expansion of the second part, but that would make the coefficient a sum of terms involving \\(c\\). But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient, perhaps it's considering only the constant term with respect to \\(c\\), or maybe it's expecting just the coefficient from the first part, 6.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again.\n\nThe expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), and when we multiply it by the entire expansion of the second part, each term in \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion.

Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). That is, when we multiply the two expressions, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) will be the same as the coefficient in the first part, multiplied by the entire second part, but that doesn't make sense because the second part is a polynomial in \\(c\\), so the coefficient would actually be a sum of terms involving \\(c\\).\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, considering all possible terms, but since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would make the coefficient a polynomial in \\(c\\), which seems odd because the question is phrased as asking for a single coefficient.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to consider that when multiplying two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in one part is multiplied by the entire other polynomial. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, not a constant.

Wait, no, the problem just says the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so maybe it's considering all possible terms, but that would make the coefficient a sum over all possible \\(c\\) terms. Hmm, this is confusing.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me try a different approach. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from expanding \\((a + b)^4\\), and when we multiply by the other part, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. So, the coefficient would be 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial in \\(c\\).\n\nBut the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so perhaps it's considering that the coefficient can be a polynomial in \\(c\\), and the answer would be 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems a bit odd because usually, when you're asked for a coefficient, it's with respect to specific variables. Maybe I'm misinterpreting the problem.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. That is, the constant term with respect to \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nThat makes more sense. So, I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), then multiply it by 6 to get the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\).\n\nOkay, so let's compute the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem again, the expansion is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\binom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\binom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\).\n\nWe need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\).\n\nSo, the constant term is \\(\\binom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\binom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\).\n\nSo, the constant term is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 times 20, which is 120.\n\nWait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake. So, \\((a + b)^4\\) gives a coefficient of 6 for \\(a^2b^2\\). Then, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) has a constant term of 20. So, multiplying these together, the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nYes, that seems right. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120.\n\nAlternatively, if I were to write out the entire expansion, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, but since we're only interested in the coefficient, and not the specific \\(c\\) terms, the constant term in the second expansion is the only part that contributes to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms. So, that's why we multiply 6 by 20 to get 120.\n\nI think that makes sense. So, the final answer is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is found by first determining the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplying it by the constant term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20.

When you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum of the products of coefficients of terms whose exponents add up to the desired term. But in this case, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), so when multiplying by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in that expansion will have some power of \\(c\\), but since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the only way for the product to have \\(a^2b^2\\) is if we multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because if we multiply by any term with \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), the resulting term would have those \\(c\\) factors, which aren't present in \\(a^2b^2\\).\n\nSo, to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiply it by the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). That makes sense because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by the constant term, you just get \\(a^2b^2\\) times that constant, so the coefficient becomes 6 times that constant.\n\nSo, now I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me think about how to do that. Again, I can use the binomial theorem for this part. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k\\). Simplifying that, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} c^{-k} = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\).\n\nI need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero because that's the constant term. So, I need \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\).\n\nCalculating \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\), that's \\(\\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). Wait, let me check that again. Actually, 6! is 720, but 3! is 6, so 6!/(3!3!) is 720/(6*6) = 720/36 = 20. Yeah, that's correct.\n\nSo, the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (the constant term from the second part). So, 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, let me double-check that. So, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. In \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the constant term is 20. So, when I multiply these together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by 20, making the coefficient 6 * 20 = 120. That seems right.\n\nIs there another way to think about this? Maybe by considering the entire expansion. But since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is by taking \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part and multiplying it by the constant term from the second part. So, yeah, that makes sense.\n\nLet me see if I can think of another approach. Maybe using generating functions or something, but I think the method I used is solid. I applied the binomial theorem correctly to both parts, found the necessary coefficients, and multiplied them together because of how the multiplication of polynomials works.\n\nI don't think I made any mistakes here. The key was recognizing that the \\(c\\) terms don't affect the \\(a^2b^2\\) term except through the constant term in their expansion. So, I just needed to find that constant term and multiply it by the coefficient from the other part.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120. I think that's the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem.\n\nFirst, consider the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\). Using the binomial theorem, each term is of the form \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k} b^{k}\\). We need the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2, which corresponds to \\(k = 2\\). The coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\):\n\n\\[\n\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\n\\]\n\nNext, consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem, each term is of the form \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We need the constant term, which occurs when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. Solving \\(6 - 2k = 0\\) gives \\(k = 3\\). The coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\):\n\n\\[\n\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\n\\]\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficients from each part:\n\n\\[\n6 \\times 20 = 120\n\\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

    "text": " I remember that when dealing with binomial expansions, I can use the binomial theorem, which involves combinations. \n\nFirst, I'll break down the problem into two parts because the expression is a product of two binomials raised to different powers. The first part is \\((a + b)^4\\) and the second part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Since I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I think I can handle each part separately and then multiply the results because the terms in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) don't interact with the terms in \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). \n\nStarting with the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\). I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in this expansion. I remember the binomial theorem says that the expansion of \\((x + y)^n\\) is the sum from \\(k = 0\\) to \\(n\\) of \\(\\dbinom{n}{k} x^{n - k} y^k\\). So, in this case, \\(x = a\\), \\(y = b\\), and \\(n = 4\\). \n\nSo, the general term is \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k} b^k\\). I need the term where \\(a^2b^2\\), so that means \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). Let me compute that coefficient: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). \n\nCalculating \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\), which is \\(\\dfrac{4!}{2!2!}\\). 4 factorial is 24, and 2 factorial is 2, so 24 divided by (2*2) is 24/4, which is 6. So, the coefficient from the first part is 6. \n\nNow, moving on to the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I'm supposed to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but wait, this part is only in terms of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), so it doesn't have any \\(a\\) or \\(b\\). Hmm, does that mean that when I multiply the two expansions together, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part will just be multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part? \n\nWait, but the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is only in the first part. The second part doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms, so maybe the coefficient from the second part is just 1? Or perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me think again. \n\nWait, no, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So when we multiply these two, each term in the expansion of the first part will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of the second part. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, since \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the first part, and the second part is multiplied as a whole, maybe the coefficient is just 6 times the entire expansion of the second part. But that doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a specific term, not an expression. \n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Maybe the problem is simply to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the \\(a^2b^2\\) term is 6 from the first part, and since the second part is multiplied by it, but it doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms, so the coefficient remains 6. \n\nWait, that seems too straightforward. Let me check. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, considering that the second part might contribute something. But since the second part is in terms of \\(c\\), which is separate from \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would just be the coefficient from the first part, multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. But that would make the coefficient a polynomial in \\(c\\), but the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, so perhaps I'm misunderstanding. \n\nWait, maybe I'm supposed to consider the entire expansion and find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. But that's not possible because the \\(c\\) terms are separate. So perhaps the answer is just 6, as the coefficient from the first part. \n\nWait, but let me think again. When you multiply two polynomials, the coefficients multiply when the variables are the same. But in this case, the first polynomial has terms with \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the second has terms with \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, when you multiply them, each term from the first will be multiplied by each term from the second, but the variables are different, so the terms don't combine. Therefore, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part will be multiplied by every term in the second expansion, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), etc. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would only come from the term where the second part contributes a constant term, i.e., \\(c^0\\), because otherwise, the term would have \\(c\\) raised to some power, not just \\(a^2b^2\\). \n\nWait, that makes sense. So, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, meaning that the term should have \\(a^2b^2\\) and no \\(c\\) terms. Therefore, we need to find the term in the second expansion \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) that has \\(c^0\\), because when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), it would give \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is just \\(a^2b^2\\). \n\nSo, first, let me find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem again, the expansion is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(1/c\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We want the exponent of \\(c\\) to be 0, so we set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). \n\nTherefore, the term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} c^{0}\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, the coefficient from the second part is 20. \n\nNow, since we're looking for the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which comes from multiplying the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first expansion (which has coefficient 6) and the \\(c^0\\) term from the second expansion (which has coefficient 20), the overall coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nWait, that makes sense. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 120. Let me double-check my steps. \n\n1. Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using binomial theorem. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n2. Expand \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). The term with \\(c^0\\) is when \\(k = 3\\), so \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n3. Multiply the coefficients from both parts: 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nYes, that seems correct. I don't think I made any mistakes here. So, the final answer should be 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then finding the constant term (coefficient of \\(c^0\\)) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20. Multiplying these gives 6 * 20 = 120.\n\n\\boxed{120}"

The binomial theorem says that \\((a + b)^n = \\sum_{k=0}^{n} \\dbinom{n}{k} a^{n - k} b^k\\). So, for \\((a + b)^4\\), each term in the expansion will be of the form \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k} b^k\\) where \\(k\\) ranges from 0 to 4.\n\nNow, the problem is asking specifically for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, I need to find the term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2. That means I need to find the value of \\(k\\) such that \\(4 - k = 2\\) for \\(a\\) and \\(k = 2\\) for \\(b\\). Solving \\(4 - k = 2\\) gives \\(k = 2\\), which also matches the exponent for \\(b\\).

That part seems straightforward.\n\nBut wait, the original expression isn't just \\((a + b)^4\\); it's multiplied by another term, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I need to consider how this multiplication affects the coefficient I found.\n\nHmm, so the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4\\) times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Since these two parts are multiplied together, the terms from each expansion will multiply each other. But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). That means I don't need to worry about the terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\), right? Because the \\(a^2b^2\\) term is only from the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), and it gets multiplied by every term from the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nWait a minute, no, that's not quite right. Actually, the entire expression is a product of two polynomials. So, when you multiply them, each term from the first polynomial is multiplied by each term from the second polynomial. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\), that term must come from multiplying the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first part by the constant term (the term with \\(c^0\\)) in the second part. Because if you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by any term involving \\(c\\), you'll end up with a term that has \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or something like that, which isn't what we want. We just want \\(a^2b^2\\), so it must come from multiplying \\(a^2b^2\\) by the constant term in the second expansion.\n\nSo, now I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).

The expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\).

So, set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\).\n\nCalculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20.\n\nNow, going back to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficient from the first part and the constant term from the second part. So, that would be \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nWait, let me double-check that. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Multiplying them together gives 120.

The general term will be \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k} b^k\\), where \\(k\\) goes from 0 to 4. So, the terms will be:\n\n- When \\(k = 0\\): \\(\\dbinom{4}{0} a^4 b^0 = 1 \\times a^4 \\times 1 = a^4\\)\n- When \\(k = 1\\): \\(\\dbinom{4}{1} a^3 b^1 = 4 \\times a^3 b = 4a^3b\\)\n- When \\(k = 2\\): \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} a^2 b^2 = 6 \\times a^2 b^2 = 6a^2b^2\\)\n- When \\(k = 3\\): \\(\\dbinom{4}{3} a^1 b^3 = 4 \\times a b^3 = 4ab^3\\)\n- When \\(k = 4\\): \\(\\dbinom{4}{4} a^0 b^4 = 1 \\times 1 \\times b^4 = b^4\\)\n\nSo, the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is \\(a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\).

So, the coefficient is 6 from the first part.\n\nBut wait, the problem isn't just \\((a + b)^4\\); it's multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I need to consider both parts together. I think I can approach this by considering the entire expression as the product of two binomial expansions and then find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. However, since the second part involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), which are different variables, I might need to think about how the terms combine.\n\nWait, actually, the question is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). That term doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), right? Because \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\). So, does that mean that when we multiply the two expressions together, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part will just be multiplied by every term in the second expansion, but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), maybe the other part just contributes a constant factor? Hmm, I'm not sure. Let me think.\n\nWait, no, actually, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when we multiply these two expansions together, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, for example, \\(a^4\\) in the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part, \\(4a^3b\\) is multiplied by each term in the second part, and so on.\n\nBut the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of what happens with \\(c\\). So, I think that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. Wait, but that doesn't make sense because the second part is a separate variable. Let me clarify.\n\nWait, no, actually, when you multiply two expressions, each term in the first expression is multiplied by each term in the second expression. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expression multiplied by the entire sum of the coefficients in the second expression, because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expression, each of those will contribute to the overall product, but since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficients from the second expansion will just scale the \\(a^2b^2\\) term.\n\nWait, that might not be correct. Let me think again. When you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum of the products of coefficients of terms whose exponents add up to the desired term. But in this case, the first polynomial is in variables \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the second is in \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). Since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), their exponents don't interfere. So, the terms in the first expansion involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) don't affect the exponents of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), and vice versa.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, each term will have a different power of \\(c\\), but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), we have to sum all those contributions.\n\nWait, but that can't be right because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\). So, actually, the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is to take the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part and multiply it by the constant term (i.e., the term with \\(c^0\\)) from the second part. Because if you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by any other term in the second expansion, you'll end up with a term that has \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), which we don't want. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part.\n\nWait, that makes more sense. Because if you take any other term from the second expansion, you'll have a \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\) term, which would make the entire term have \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2 \\times 1/c^k\\), which isn't just \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) is to multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term by the constant term in the second expansion.\n\nSo, now I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me work on that.\n\nAgain, using the binomial theorem, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) can be expanded as the sum from \\(k = 0\\) to \\(6\\) of \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k\\). Simplifying that, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} c^{-k} = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\).\n\nSo, we need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be 0, which means \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the term with \\(c^0\\) is when \\(k = 3\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} c^{0} = 20 \\times 1 = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20.\n\nTherefore, going back to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, let me double-check that. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part is 20, so 6 * 20 is indeed 120. That seems correct.\n\nBut just to make sure I'm not making a mistake, let me go through it again. The first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), when expanded, has a term \\(6a^2b^2\\). The second part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), when expanded, has a term \\(20c^0\\). When I multiply these two terms together, I get \\(6a^2b^2 * 20c^0 = 120a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120.\n\nIs there any other way this could be approached? Maybe by considering the entire expansion and looking for cross terms, but I think that would complicate things. Since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), their exponents don't interfere, so the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) is by multiplying the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part with the constant term from the second part. So, I think my reasoning is solid.\n\nJust to recap:\n\n1. Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6.\n2. Expand \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem. The coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20.\n3. Multiply these two coefficients together to get the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product: 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nI don't see any mistakes in this reasoning. So, I think the coefficient is 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem.\n\nFirst, we expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem. The general term is \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k} b^k\\). The term involving \\(a^2b^2\\) occurs when \\(k = 2\\), which is:\n\\[\n\\dbinom{4}{2} a^2 b^2 = 6a^2b^2\n\\]\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\nNext, we consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem, the general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, which occurs when \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(k = 3\\). The term is:\n\\[\n\\dbinom{6}{3} c^0 = 20\n\\]\nThus, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20.\n\nFinally, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the product of the coefficients from the two expansions:\n\\[\n6 \\times 20 = 120\n\\]\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

    "text": " I'm a bit nervous because I'm not super confident with binomial expansions, but I think I can handle it.\n\nFirst, I remember that when you have an expression like \\((a + b)^n\\), you can expand it using the binomial theorem. The binomial theorem says that each term in the expansion is of the form \\(\\dbinom{n}{k} a^{n - k}b^k\\), where \\(\\dbinom{n}{k}\\) is the binomial coefficient, which can be found using combinations. So, maybe I can apply this theorem to both parts of the given expression.\n\nThe given expression is a product of two binomials: \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I notice that the terms inside each binomial are different\u2014one involves \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the other involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). Since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I think I can focus on expanding just the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), because that's where the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms come from. The second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), might not directly affect the \\(a^2b^2\\) term, but I'm not entirely sure how they interact yet.\n\nLet me write down the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem. The general term in the expansion is \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\\). I need the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2, so I need \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). Let me check that: if \\(4 - k = 2\\), then \\(k = 2\\). So, the term is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} a^{2}b^{2}\\).\n\nCalculating the binomial coefficient: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\nNow, what about the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)? I'm wondering if this part affects the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), maybe I don't need to expand this part at all. Or do I?\n\nWait, actually, the entire expression is a product of \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when you multiply them out, each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since the problem is only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), I might need to consider how the product affects this term.\n\nWait a second, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. If I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), that term is entirely within the first binomial, \\((a + b)^4\\). The second binomial, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), when expanded, will produce terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), but none of them will affect the \\(a^2b^2\\) term because they don't have any \\(a\\) or \\(b\\) in them. Therefore, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will just be multiplied by the entire expansion of the second binomial. However, since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and not considering any \\(c\\) terms, perhaps I can treat the second binomial as a constant multiplier for the entire \\((a + b)^4\\) expansion.\n\nWait, but that doesn't seem right. Let me think again. When you have a product of two expressions, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, for example, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since we're only interested in the term \\(a^2b^2\\), which is in the first part, and we don't have any \\(a\\) or \\(b\\) in the second part, the only way \\(a^2b^2\\) can appear in the product is if it's multiplied by a term that has \\(c^0\\), i.e., a term that is a constant (since \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) can't combine to give a constant unless their exponents cancel out). So, maybe I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) and then multiply it by the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\).\n\nWait, that makes more sense. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product will be the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I need to compute both of these.\n\nI already found that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. Now, I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me figure that out.\n\nUsing the binomial theorem again, the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) will have terms of the form \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We want the exponent of \\(c\\) to be zero, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} c^{0} = \\dbinom{6}{3}\\).\n\nCalculating \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\): \\(\\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of 6 and 20, which is 120.\n\nWait, let me double-check that. So, the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the constant term from the other expansion is 20, so 6 times 20 is 120. That seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of the entire product as \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), and when you expand this, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in the other expansion. But since we're only interested in the \\(a^2b^2\\) term, which doesn't involve \\(c\\), it can only come from the product of the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first part and the constant term in the second part. So, yeah, that's 6 times 20, which is 120.\n\nI think that makes sense.

Using the binomial theorem, the general term is \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\\). We need the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2.

So, unless the second part has a term that's just a constant (i.e., \\(c^0\\)), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part.\n\nWait, that makes sense. Because when you multiply two terms together, the exponents add. So, to get \\(a^2b^2\\), we need to take the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part and multiply it by a term from the second part that doesn't change the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) exponents. Since the second part only has \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), the only way to not affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) exponents is to multiply by a constant term (i.e., \\(c^0\\)).\n\nSo, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me expand that using the binomial theorem as well. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k\\).

So, \\((a + b)^4\\) gives me \\(a^2b^2\\) with coefficient 6, and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) gives me a constant term with coefficient 20. Multiplying these together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will have a coefficient of 6 * 20 = 120. That seems right.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should think about the entire expansion. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). When you expand both, each term in the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, but only the constant term (i.e., the term with \\(c^0\\)) will result in a term that's \\(a^2b^2\\) times a constant, without any \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\) terms.

Yep, that's correct.\n\nAnd \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) is 6, which is correct as well.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but hold on, another thought: when I multiply the two expansions, each term from the first is multiplied by each term from the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is multiplied by every term in the second part, but only the constant term contributes to \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. The other terms would add exponents of \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), making the term not just \\(a^2b^2\\) anymore.

Because otherwise, the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\), which isn't typical. So, maybe I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nWait, let me think again. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). When you multiply these out, each term in the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term from the second part, which are of the form \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\times (1/c)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\).\n\nSo, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be \\(6a^2b^2 \\times \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\) for each \\(k\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would include all the coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by 6. Wait, no, actually, when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum of the products of the coefficients of the terms that multiply together to give that specific term.\n\nBut in this case, since \\(a^2b^2\\) is only from the first part, and the second part can contribute any power of \\(c\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be \\(6\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that seems odd because the coefficient should be a single number, not a polynomial.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable, so the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\). But that doesn't make much sense because usually, coefficients are constants. Alternatively, maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), that is, the term where the exponents of \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are 2, 2, and 0 respectively. That would make sense because then the coefficient would be a constant.\n\nSo, perhaps I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product. That would mean that when I multiply the terms from both expansions, I get \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\). So, from the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, as I found earlier. From the second part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), I need the coefficient of \\(c^0\\), which is the constant term.\n\nSo, let me compute the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\times (1/c)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We want the exponent of \\(c\\) to be 0, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n\nSo, the constant term in the second part is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire product is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nWait, but the problem didn't specify the power of \\(c\\), it just asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, maybe I'm supposed to consider all terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present, regardless of the power of \\(c\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make much sense because coefficients are typically constants. So, perhaps the problem is indeed asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is only considering the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms, so the constant term in \\(c\\). So, I think that's the right approach.\n\nLet me double-check my steps. First, I found the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. Then, I found the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 20. Multiplying these together gives 120. That seems correct.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me think about expanding both parts and multiplying. So, \\((a + b)^4\\) expands to \\(a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). And \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) expands to \\(c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15/c^2 + 6/c^4 + 1/c^6\\).\n\nSo, when I multiply these two expansions, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second part. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be \\(6 \\times (c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15/c^2 + 6/c^4 + 1/c^6)\\). But that's a polynomial in \\(c\\), which seems to contradict the idea of a single coefficient.\n\nTherefore, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is the constant term, so 6 times 20, which is 120. That makes sense because it's a single number. Alternatively, if the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without considering \\(c\\), then it would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but that's not a single number, so I think the former interpretation is correct.\n\nTherefore, I conclude that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression, considering only the constant term in \\(c\\), is 120.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not missing anything. Another way to think about it is that when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each polynomial, provided the variables multiply appropriately. So, in this case, since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second polynomial. So, yes, that's 6 times 20, which is 120.\n\nTherefore, I'm confident that the coefficient is 120.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem on each part separately.\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k} b^k\n   \\]\n   The term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\), so its coefficient is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\n   \\]\n\n2. **Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n   \\]\n   The constant term (where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0) occurs when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which gives \\(m = 3\\). The coefficient is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\n   \\]\n\n3. **Multiply the coefficients from both expansions:**\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 20 = 120\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

    "text": " I'm a bit nervous because it's been a while since I did binomial expansions, but I think I can handle it.\n\nFirst, I remember that when you have an expression like \\((a + b)^n\\), you can expand it using the binomial theorem. The binomial theorem says that \\((a + b)^n = \\sum_{k=0}^{n} \\dbinom{n}{k} a^{n - k} b^{k}\\). So, maybe I can apply this theorem to both parts of the given expression: \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nWait, but the question is only asking about the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). That means I don't need to worry about the entire expansion of both parts; I just need to find the part of the expansion where \\(a\\) is squared and \\(b\\) is squared. Once I have that, I can multiply it by the corresponding part from the other binomial, but since the problem only asks for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), maybe the other part doesn't matter? Hmm, not sure yet, let me think.\n\nSo, let's start with the first part: \\((a + b)^4\\). I need the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Using the binomial theorem, the general term is \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k} b^{k}\\). I want \\(a^2b^2\\), so that means \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\).\n\nCalculating that, \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. That part was straightforward.\n\nNow, the second part of the expression is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I'm not sure if I need to consider this part when looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is only from the first binomial, so maybe the second binomial doesn't affect it? But then again, the entire expression is the product of both binomials, so when I expand them, I might get terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by some terms from the second binomial. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of what's happening with \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, does that mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just 6 times whatever comes from the second binomial when multiplied by 1? Or maybe I'm overcomplicating.\n\nWait, no. Let me clarify. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When we multiply these two expansions together, each term from the first expansion is multiplied by each term from the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by every term from the second part. But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so actually, when we multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by terms from the second binomial, it's going to produce terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2 \\times c^{-k}\\), right? So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would just be the coefficient from the first part, 6, multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part, but since we're only interested in \\(a^2b^2\\), maybe the second part's expansion doesn't affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, that can't be right because when you multiply, the coefficients get multiplied as well.\n\nWait, no, actually, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that only comes from the first binomial, then in the product, that term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by every term from the second binomial. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems odd because the coefficient would then be a polynomial in \\(c\\), but the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). That is, when you expand the entire expression, you get terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) and \\(a^2b^2c^{-k}\\), and the coefficient for each such term would be 6 times the corresponding coefficients from the second expansion. But if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without considering the \\(c\\) terms, then maybe it's just 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. Wait, but that doesn't make much sense because the coefficient would then be 6 times \\(2^6\\), which is 6 times 64, which is 384. But that seems too high, and I'm not sure if that's the right approach.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me think again. The problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term in the product of the two expansions. So, when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term from the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the entire second expansion, which is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), but the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, which suggests that perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the powers of \\(c\\), so the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^k\\) in the second expansion. But if the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), without any restriction on \\(c\\), then perhaps it's the sum of all such coefficients. But that seems a bit unclear.\n\nWait, no, maybe the problem is just to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, which would include all possible powers of \\(c\\). But that doesn't make sense because the coefficient would then be a function of \\(c\\), not a single number. So perhaps I'm misinterpreting the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, it's possible that the problem is treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable, and the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be a polynomial in \\(c\\). But that seems unlikely because usually, when you're asked for a coefficient, it's a numerical coefficient, not a polynomial.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, meaning that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion. Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, each term will have a coefficient, and the total coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) across all possible \\(c\\) terms would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients from the second expansion.\n\nWait, but the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\). So, \\(\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times 64, which is 384. But I'm not sure if that's the correct approach because I might be overcounting or misunderstanding the problem.\n\nWait, perhaps another approach. Let me consider that the entire expression is a product of two independent expansions. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the entire second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. So, perhaps the problem is only considering the terms where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out, meaning \\(c^0\\), so that the term is just a constant. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\) would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion.\n\nWait, that makes more sense. So, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, specifically when the exponents of \\(c\\) are zero, meaning \\(c^0\\). So, in that case, I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product. That would mean I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part, which is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nOkay, so now I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let's work on that. Using the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\).\n\nWe want the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, so we set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\).\n\nCalculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). Wait, that's not right. Let me calculate again: 6! is 720, 3! is 6, so 720 divided by (6 * 6) is 720 / 36, which is indeed 20. So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire product is the product of the coefficients from each part, which is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the second part). So, 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. The problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", and I'm interpreting it as the coefficient when multiplied by \\(c^0\\). But maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the entire second expansion, but that can't be right because the coefficient should be a number, not a polynomial.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is considering the entire product and wants the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. As I calculated earlier, the sum of coefficients in the second expansion is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. But that seems high, and I'm not sure if that's the correct interpretation.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is indeed asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be 6 * 20 = 120. That makes sense because when you multiply the two expansions, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part can only combine with the \\(c^0\\) term from the second part to give a term that's just \\(a^2b^2\\), without any \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\) factors. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, considering only the \\(c^0\\) term, is 120.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. If I don't restrict to \\(c^0\\), then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which would give me a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for a coefficient, which is a number, so it's more likely that they want the coefficient when the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out, meaning \\(c^0\\). So, I think 120 is the correct answer.\n\nTo recap: The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, considering only the \\(c^0\\) term, is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, just to make sure, let me think about another approach. Maybe I can consider the entire product as a product of two independent binomial expansions, so when I multiply them, the terms combine. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion will multiply each term from the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the entire second expansion. But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. Therefore, the only way this makes sense is if we're considering the coefficient when the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out, which is the \\(c^0\\) term, giving us 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nYes, I think that's correct. So, the final answer is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is found using the binomial theorem, which gives us 6. The coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Multiplying these gives 6 * 20 = 120.\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\boxed{120}."

So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would actually be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because when you multiply, each term will have a part from each bracket.\n\nWait, but that doesn't seem right because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\).

Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would just be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which would mean that the coefficient is \\(6\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems off because the problem is asking for a specific coefficient, not a sum.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Maybe it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some specific \\(k\\), but the problem as stated only mentions \\(a^2b^2\\), without any \\(c\\) terms. So, perhaps the problem is considering the product as a polynomial in multiple variables, and the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the product of the coefficients from each part, but that doesn't make sense because the other part has \\(c\\) terms.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times some power of \\(c\\), but it's not specified. That seems confusing. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when considering the entire product, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, that would mean that the coefficient is \\(6\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which would give a term \\(6 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that doesn't make sense because \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term without \\(c\\), so perhaps the coefficient is zero unless there's a term with \\(c^0\\) in the other expansion.\n\nWait, that makes more sense. Because if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, then it's looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2 \\times c^0\\), because \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term without any \\(c\\) terms. So, that would mean that the coefficient is \\(6\\) multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nAh, that makes sense now. So, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), then multiply it by 6 to get the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product.\n\nOkay, so let me focus on finding the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). To do this, I can use the binomial theorem again.\n\nExpanding \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we get:\n\n\\[\n\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n\\]\n\nSo, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be 0, so we set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\).\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\), which is 20.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nWait, let me double-check that. So, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. In \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. When you multiply these two parts together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by the constant term (i.e., \\(c^0\\)) from the second part, resulting in \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\) as the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\).\n\nYes, that seems correct. I think I got it right.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break down the problem into two parts:\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\n   \\]\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) here is 6.\n\n2. **Find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   Using the binomial theorem:\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n   \\]\n   The term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0 occurs when \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\). The coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n\n3. **Multiply the coefficients:**\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."
