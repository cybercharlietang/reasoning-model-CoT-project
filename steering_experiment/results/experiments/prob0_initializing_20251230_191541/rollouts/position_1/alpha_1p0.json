    "text": " I'm a bit rusty on my combinatorics, but I think I can work through this.\n\nFirst, I remember that when expanding expressions like \\((x + y)^n\\), we can use the binomial theorem. The binomial theorem says that each term in the expansion is of the form \\(\\dbinom{n}{k} x^{n - k} y^k\\), where \\(\\dbinom{n}{k}\\) is the binomial coefficient, which can be found using combinations. So, maybe I can apply this here.\n\nThe given expression is a product of two binomials: \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Since these are multiplied together, the overall expansion will be the product of the expansions of each binomial. That means I can handle each part separately and then combine the results.\n\nLet me start with the first part: \\((a + b)^4\\). I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in this expansion. Using the binomial theorem, the general term in the expansion is \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k} b^k\\), where \\(k\\) can be 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4.\n\nI'm looking for the term where the exponents of both \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2. That means \\(4 - k = 2\\) for \\(a\\), so \\(k = 2\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\).\n\nCalculating that, \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6.\n\nNow, moving on to the second part: \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I need to figure out how this part affects the overall coefficient when multiplied by the first part. But wait, the first part only involves \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), while the second part involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, maybe the second part doesn't directly affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)? Or does it?\n\nWait a second, let me think again. The entire expression is the product of two expansions. So, when we multiply them together, each term from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term from the second expansion. But since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\), and \\(1/c\\) are different variables, the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) will only come from the first part, and the exponents of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) will come from the second part.\n\nTherefore, when looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), we only need to consider the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part, and any term from the second part, because multiplying by a term involving \\(c\\) won't affect the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. But wait, that doesn't seem right because the second part is multiplied by each term in the first part.\n\nWait, no, actually, when you have a product of two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum of the products of coefficients of terms whose variables multiply to give the desired term. But in this case, since the variables in the first part are \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and in the second part are \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), the variables are distinct. So, the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are independent of the exponents of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). Therefore, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be multiplied by every term in the second expansion, each time contributing a factor from the second expansion.\n\nWait, but that would mean the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire sum of the coefficients in the second part. But that doesn't sound right either, because each term in the second expansion has different powers of \\(c\\), so when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), each would contribute a different term, but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\), maybe we just need to consider the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire second expansion.\n\nWait, no, that's not correct. Let me clarify: when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. So, if I have \\(P(a, b) \\times Q(c)\\), then each term in \\(P(a, b)\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(Q(c)\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(P(a, b)\\) will be multiplied by every term in \\(Q(c)\\), resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for various \\(k\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, does that mean we need to consider all possible terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any term from the second expansion, and sum their coefficients?\n\nWait, but in that case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Because each term in the second part contributes a coefficient that gets multiplied by the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part, and since we're summing over all possible terms from the second part, the total coefficient would be the product of the coefficient from the first part and the sum of coefficients from the second part.\n\nBut wait, let me test this idea. Let's say the first part is \\(P(a, b) = (a + b)^4\\), and the second part is \\(Q(c) = \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). If I consider the product \\(P(a, b) \\times Q(c)\\), then each term in \\(P(a, b)\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(Q(c)\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(P(a, b)\\) has a coefficient of 6, as we found earlier. Then, when we multiply this by each term in \\(Q(c)\\), each term in \\(Q(c)\\) is of the form \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\\).\n\nSo, the product of \\(a^2b^2\\) with each term in \\(Q(c)\\) would be \\(6 \\times \\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\\), for \\(k = 0\\) to \\(6\\). Therefore, in the entire product, the term \\(a^2b^2c^{6 - 2k}\\) has a coefficient of \\(6 \\times \\dbinom{6}{k}\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, does that mean we need to sum all these coefficients for all possible \\(k\\)?\n\nWait, but that would give the total coefficient when considering all powers of \\(c\\). But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), irrespective of the \\(c\\) terms. So, perhaps the answer is simply 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(Q(c)\\).\n\nWait, but the sum of all coefficients in \\(Q(c)\\) is obtained by setting \\(c = 1\\), because substituting \\(c = 1\\) into \\(Q(c)\\) gives the sum of all coefficients. So, let me compute that.\n\nFirst, \\(Q(c) = \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). If I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(Q(1) = (1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the sum of all coefficients in \\(Q(c)\\) is 64.\n\nSo, if I multiply this by the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). Hmm, that seems plausible.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. Because when I multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in \\(Q(c)\\), each term in \\(Q(c)\\) contributes a different power of \\(c\\), but the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the sum of all the coefficients from each multiplication. So, it's 6 times the sum of coefficients in \\(Q(c)\\), which is 6 times 64, giving 384.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should think of it as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire second part, because when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a term in one polynomial is multiplied by the entire other polynomial. So, in this case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6, and when multiplied by the second part, which is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the coefficient becomes 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, the coefficient is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second part, which is 6 times 64, which is 384.\n\nWait, but let me confirm this approach. Let's take a simpler example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Let's compute the coefficient of \\(a^2b^0\\).\n\nIn the first part, \\((a + b)^2\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{2}{2} = 1\\). The second part is \\(c + 1/c\\). The sum of coefficients in the second part is when \\(c = 1\\), which is \\(1 + 1 = 2\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) in the product would be \\(1 \\times 2 = 2\\). Let's check by expanding:\n\n\\((a + b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2\\).\n\n\\((c + 1/c) = c + 1/c\\).\n\nMultiplying these together:\n\n\\(a^2(c + 1/c) + 2ab(c + 1/c) + b^2(c + 1/c)\\).\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2\\) is \\(1 \\times (c + 1/c)\\), which, when considering all terms, is \\(c + 1/c\\). But if we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, then we can consider the sum of the coefficients, which is 2, so the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) is 2, which matches our earlier calculation.\n\nSo, applying this logic back to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6, and the sum of the coefficients in the second part is 64, so the total coefficient is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\nWait, but let me think again. Is there another way to approach this problem? Maybe by considering the entire expansion as a product and looking for the specific term. But since the variables are independent, the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are determined by the first part, and the exponents of \\(c\\) are determined by the second part. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be multiplied by every term from the second expansion, each contributing a different power of \\(c\\). But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in effect, we're summing over all possible terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any term from the second expansion, which means we're summing the coefficients of all those terms, which is the same as multiplying the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part by the sum of all coefficients in the second part.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient is indeed \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\nWait, but let me just confirm by actually expanding both parts and looking at the product. Although expanding the entire expression might be tedious, maybe I can check a simpler case.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can think of it as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part being 6, and the second part, when expanded, has terms with coefficients that, when multiplied by 6, contribute to the overall coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. But since the second part's terms don't affect the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), each term in the second part just scales the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) by its own coefficient. Therefore, the total coefficient is the product of 6 and the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nI think that makes sense. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 384.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me compute the sum of the coefficients in the second part again. The second part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The sum of the coefficients is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), so \\( (1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). That seems correct.\n\nAnd the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is indeed 6, as we calculated using the binomial coefficient \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\).\n\nSo, putting it all together, 6 * 64 = 384. Therefore, the coefficient is 384.\n\nWait, but let me just think again: when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a term in the product is the sum of the products of coefficients of terms whose variables multiply to give that term. But in this case, since the variables are different, the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are determined solely by the first polynomial, and the exponents of \\(c\\) are determined by the second. So, when looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, we are effectively summing over all possible products where the first part contributes \\(a^2b^2\\) and the second part contributes any term. Therefore, the coefficient is the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and the sum of coefficients in the second part.\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, I think I can confidently say that the coefficient is 384.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{384}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break down the problem into two parts and use the binomial theorem.\n\n1. **Expanding \\((a + b)^4\\):**\n   Using the binomial theorem, the general term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is given by:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k} b^k\n   \\]\n   We need the term where the exponents of both \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2. This occurs when \\(k = 2\\), so the coefficient is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\n   \\]\n\n2. **Considering the second part \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   The sum of all coefficients in this expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\):\n   \\[\n   \\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\n   \\]\n\n3. **Combining the results:**\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficient from the first part and the sum of the coefficients from the second part:\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 64 = 384\n   \\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is \\(\\boxed{384}\\)."

    "text": " I'm a bit confused, but I'll take it slow.\n\nFirst, I think I should handle each part of the expression separately and then combine them. The expression has two parts multiplied together: \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Since I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), maybe I don't need to worry about the \\(c\\) terms because they don't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\). Wait, is that right?\n\nLet me think. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from expanding \\((a + b)^4\\). The other part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), when expanded, will have terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), but since I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), perhaps I can consider the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) as a single term, or maybe it's multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, no, that doesn't seem right.\n\nWait, actually, the entire expression is a product of two expansions. So, when you multiply them together, each term from the first expansion \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term from the second expansion \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since I'm only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I need to find how many times \\(a^2b^2\\) appears when multiplied by any term from the second expansion. But wait, \\(a^2b^2\\) is part of the first expansion, so maybe the second expansion just contributes a constant factor when considering the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Hmm, that might make sense.\n\nWait, no, that's not quite right. Let me clarify. When I expand \\((a + b)^4\\), each term will be of the form \\(\\binom{4}{k}a^{k}b^{4 - k}\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) occurs when \\(k = 2\\), so the coefficient is \\(\\binom{4}{2}\\). Then, the other part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), when expanded, will have terms, but since I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, I think I need to consider that the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part is multiplied by every term from the second part. But wait, that would mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be \\(\\binom{4}{2}\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't seem right because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would be a term in the product, but the second expansion might have variables that could affect the coefficient. Wait, no, because \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), so when you multiply the two expansions, the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) won't interact with the terms involving \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that can't be right because that would make the coefficient a polynomial in \\(c\\), but the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, I think. Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating this.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Maybe it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning that the powers of \\(c\\) should cancel out to zero. So, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), I need to find the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by a term in the second expansion that has \\(c^0\\), i.e., \\(c^0 = 1\\). So, in other words, I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part. That makes sense because when you multiply, the exponents add up, so if I want \\(c^0\\), I need to take the term from the second expansion that has \\(c^0\\), and then multiply it by the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first expansion. So, the overall coefficient would be \\(\\binom{4}{2}\\) times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nOkay, so let's break it down.\n\nFirst, find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\). Using the binomial theorem, \\((a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^4 \\binom{4}{k}a^{k}b^{4 - k}\\). So, when \\(k = 2\\), the term is \\(\\binom{4}{2}a^2b^2\\). The coefficient is \\(\\binom{4}{2}\\), which is 6.\n\nNext, find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Again, using the binomial theorem, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^6 \\binom{6}{m}c^{m}\\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^{6 - m}\\). Simplifying the exponent: \\(c^{m} \\times c^{-(6 - m)} = c^{2m - 6}\\). We want the exponent to be 0, so \\(2m - 6 = 0\\), which gives \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(\\binom{6}{3}\\), which is 20.\n\nNow, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product is the product of the two coefficients: 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, so that would mean the coefficient is 120. Let me check if that makes sense.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider that the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. But that doesn't seem right because the entire expression includes both \\(a, b\\) and \\(c\\), so the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by various powers of \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would imply that we're looking for all terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. Wait, but that can't be, because each term in the expansion would have both \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) parts and \\(c\\) parts. So, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\). That would make sense, so the coefficient would be 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nLet me double-check my steps.\n\n1. Coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is \\(\\binom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n2. Coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\binom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n3. Multiply these coefficients together: 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, considering the \\(c\\) terms, is 120.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because if I just wanted the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\), then it would be 6 times the entire expansion of the second part, which is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem might be implying that we're looking for the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\), so that the term is just \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient is 120.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider that when multiplying the two expansions, each term from the first expansion is multiplied by each term from the second, so the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by each term from the second part, which includes various powers of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire second expansion. But that would mean the coefficient isn't a single number but a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for a coefficient, which is a number, so I think it's more likely that we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nWait, but let me think again. The problem says: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" It doesn't specify anything about \\(c\\), so maybe it's just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. But that would mean that each term in the product would have both \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) parts and \\(c\\) parts, so \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by various powers of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually be a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a coefficient, which is a number. Therefore, I think the problem must be asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\), so that the term is just \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient is 120.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is considering that \\(c\\) is a separate variable, and the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by the coefficient from the first. Wait, no, that would make the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) equal to 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion. The sum of the coefficients in the second expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), so \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient would be 6 * 64 = 384. But that seems too high, and I'm not sure if that's the right approach.\n\nWait, no, that approach would be correct if we were considering the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable, but the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which in the product would be a term that includes both \\(a^2b^2\\) and some power of \\(c\\). But the problem doesn't specify a particular power of \\(c\\), so I'm confused.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again. The problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are different variables, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by every term from the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire second expansion. But that would mean the coefficient isn't a single number but a polynomial in \\(c\\). However, the problem is asking for a coefficient, which is a number, so perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\). That would make sense because then the coefficient is a number. So, to find that, I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part, then multiply them together.\n\nSo, as I calculated earlier, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but let me confirm that. The second expansion is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). When I expand this, each term is \\(\\binom{6}{m}c^{m} \\times (1/c)^{6 - m}\\) which simplifies to \\(\\binom{6}{m}c^{2m - 6}\\). To get \\(c^0\\), set \\(2m - 6 = 0\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(\\binom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, yes, that's correct.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is 6 * 20 = 120. So, the answer should be 120.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me think of another way. Maybe I can consider the entire expansion as a product and look for the specific term. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\) with coefficient 6, and the term \\(c^0\\) comes from the second expansion with coefficient 20. Therefore, when you multiply these two terms together, you get \\(6 \\times 20 \\times a^2b^2c^0 = 120a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient is indeed 120.\n\nI think that makes sense. So, the final answer should be 120.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break the problem into two parts:\n\n1. **Coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\):**\n   Using the binomial theorem, the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is:\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^4 \\binom{4}{k}a^{k}b^{4 - k}\n   \\]\n   The term \\(a^2b^2\\) occurs when \\(k = 2\\), so the coefficient is:\n   \\[\n   \\binom{4}{2} = 6\n   \\]\n\n2. **Coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   Using the binomial theorem, the expansion is:\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^6 \\binom{6}{m}c^{m}\\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^{6 - m} = \\sum_{m=0}^6 \\binom{6}{m}c^{2m - 6}\n   \\]\n   To find the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0:\n   \\[\n   2m - 6 = 0 \\implies m = 3\n   \\]\n   The coefficient is:\n   \\[\n   \\binom{6}{3} = 20\n   \\]\n\n3. **Combining the coefficients:**\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product is the product of the two coefficients:\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 20 = 120\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

    "text": " \n\nFirst, I remember that when dealing with expansions like \\((a + b)^n\\), we can use the binomial theorem. The binomial theorem states that \\((a + b)^n = \\sum_{k=0}^{n} \\dbinom{n}{k} a^{n - k} b^{k}\\). So, maybe I can apply that here.\n\nThe problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). That means in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\), I need to find the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2. Let me write that out.\n\nFor \\((a + b)^4\\), the general term is \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k} b^{k}\\). So, if I want \\(a^2b^2\\), that would mean \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). So, substituting \\(k = 2\\), the coefficient would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\).\n\nCalculating \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\), which is \\(\\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient from the \\((a + b)^4\\) part is 6.\n\nNow, the expression also has another part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I'm not sure if this part affects the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), because \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are different variables from \\(c\\). Wait, maybe the variables are separate, so the coefficients multiply? Let me think.\n\nWait, no, actually, the entire expression is a product of two expansions: one in terms of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and another in terms of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, when we multiply them together, each term from the first expansion will multiply each term from the second expansion. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), the other part must just contribute a constant factor, right?\n\nWait, but that doesn't seem right. Wait, no, actually, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term is only from the first part, and the second part is multiplied by it. So, perhaps the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the entire second part? Wait, but that doesn't make sense because the second part is a polynomial in \\(c\\), so when you multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), it would be \\(a^2b^2\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term in the product, so maybe the \\(c\\) terms don't affect the \\(a^2b^2\\) term? Wait, I'm getting confused.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, in other words, in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, not an expression involving \\(c\\). Hmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding the question.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning that we're looking for the term where \\(a\\) is squared, \\(b\\) is squared, and \\(c\\) is to the zero power. That makes more sense because then we have to consider both expansions together.\n\nSo, let me try that approach. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first part, as I calculated, with a coefficient of 6. Then, the second part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), will have a term where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out, i.e., \\(c^0\\), because we need the entire term to be \\(a^2b^2c^0\\).\n\nSo, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Once I have that, I can multiply it by the 6 from the first part to get the overall coefficient.\n\nAlright, so let's tackle the second part: finding the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\).\n\nAgain, using the binomial theorem, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(1/c\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\).\n\nWe need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be zero, so we set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\).\n\nTherefore, the term where \\(m = 3\\) will have \\(c^0\\). The coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\).\n\nCalculating \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\): \\(\\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\).\n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part is 20.\n\nNow, going back to the original problem, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part has a coefficient of 6, and the term \\(c^0\\) from the second part has a coefficient of 20. Since these two terms are multiplied together in the product, the overall coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nWait, but let me double-check to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nFirst, in the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\\). That seems correct.\n\nThen, in the second part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term where \\(c^0\\) is when \\(m = 3\\), which gives \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}c^{6 - 6} = 20c^0 = 20\\). So, that's correct too.\n\nTherefore, when we multiply the two expansions together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will multiply the 20 from the second part, giving \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120.\n\nWait, but hold on a second. The problem didn't specify anything about \\(c\\), so maybe I was overcomplicating it by considering \\(c^0\\). Maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). But that would mean that the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which isn't a single number. So, that can't be right.\n\nTherefore, I think my initial approach was correct: the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without considering \\(c\\), but that wouldn't make much sense because the expression involves both \\(a, b\\) and \\(c\\). So, I think the correct interpretation is that we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by any power of \\(c\\), but that's not the case because the problem didn't specify, so perhaps I should consider only the coefficient in the first part, which is 6, and then the second part is just a multiplier. But that doesn't seem right either.\n\nWait, no, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product. So, when you multiply two expressions, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second part, which is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would actually be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), not a single number. That can't be right because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. Therefore, I think the problem must be asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are squared and \\(c\\) is to the zero power.\n\nTherefore, my initial approach was correct, and the coefficient is 120.\n\nWait, but let me make sure. Let me think about the structure of the product.\n\nThe entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, when you expand this, each term will be of the form \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}a^{4 - k}b^{k} \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\).\n\nSo, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would require \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\), so that's the 6 coefficient as before. Then, for the \\(c\\) part, we can have any exponent, but if we're looking for the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any power of \\(c\\), then the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a coefficient, not an expression. Therefore, I think the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion, which is 20, so 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, but that would mean the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial, not a number. Therefore, I think the correct interpretation is that we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), so 120.\n\nWait, but to be thorough, let me check if there's another way to interpret the problem. Maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, without considering \\(c\\). But that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is not a single number. So, that can't be right.\n\nTherefore, I think the correct answer is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is found by considering the contributions from both parts of the product. \n\n1. **From \\((a + b)^4\\):**\n   - The term \\(a^2b^2\\) has a coefficient of \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n\n2. **From \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   - The term with \\(c^0\\) is found when \\(m = 3\\), giving a coefficient of \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n\n3. **Combining both parts:**\n   - Multiply the coefficients: \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is 120.\n\n\\boxed{120}"

    "text": " \n\nFirst, I know that when dealing with expressions raised to a power, the binomial theorem is really useful. The binomial theorem says that \\((x + y)^n = \\sum_{k=0}^{n} \\dbinom{n}{k} x^{n - k} y^k\\). So maybe I can apply this theorem to both parts of the given expression.\n\nThe expression has two parts: \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Since these two parts are multiplied together, the overall expression is the product of two binomial expansions. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) will come from the product of specific terms from each expansion.\n\nLet me start with the first part: \\((a + b)^4\\). I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) here. Using the binomial theorem, the general term in the expansion is \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k} b^k\\). So, to get \\(a^2b^2\\), I set \\(4 - k = 2\\), which means \\(k = 2\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\).\n\nCalculating that, \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6.\n\nNow, moving on to the second part: \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I'm a bit confused here because this part involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), but in the original problem, we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, does this second part even affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)? Because \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), right?\n\nHmm, that makes me think. Since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are different variables, their exponents in the product won't interfere with each other. So, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are independent of the terms involving \\(c\\). \n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression should just be the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), the \\(c\\) terms don't affect it. \n\nWait, is that right? Let me think again. When I multiply two expressions, each term from the first expression is multiplied by each term from the second. But since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are different variables, the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are independent of \\(c\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will come from taking \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part and any term from the second part. But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), I think we just need to consider the coefficient from the first part and then account for the entire second part as a scalar multiple.\n\nBut wait, actually, no. Because the second part is also being multiplied, but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), the terms involving \\(c\\) will just be constants when considering the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. So, in other words, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't make sense because the entire expansion is a sum of terms with different powers of \\(c\\). \n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try a different approach. Since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are different variables, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be the product of \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part and any term from the second part. But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), I think that the coefficient is just the product of the coefficients from each part. But that would mean I need to multiply the coefficient from the first part by the entire sum of the second part, which isn't correct because that would give me a sum, not a single coefficient.\n\nWait, no, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some specific \\(k\\)? But the problem doesn't specify any power of \\(c\\), so it's just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). \n\nIf that's the case, then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part, which is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, not an expression involving \\(c\\). \n\nHmm, maybe I misread the problem. Let me check again. It says: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), treating \\(c\\) as another variable. So, in the product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by various powers of \\(c\\), but the coefficient for each of these terms will be 6 times the corresponding coefficient from the second expansion.\n\nBut since the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), I think it's simply 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in the second expansion. Wait, but that doesn't make sense because the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion would be when \\(c = 1\\), so substituting \\(c = 1\\) into \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, the coefficient would be 6 * 64 = 384. But that seems too large, and I'm not sure if that's the correct approach.\n\nWait, maybe not. Let me think again. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be the product of \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part and any term from the second part. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is actually the sum of the products of the coefficients of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and each term in the second part. But since the first part's coefficient is 6, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients in the second expansion. But the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion is indeed 64, as I thought earlier. So, 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nBut wait, is that correct? Because the second expansion is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which has terms like \\(c^6\\), \\(6c^4\\), \\(15c^2\\), \\(20\\), \\(15c^{-2}\\), \\(6c^{-4}\\), \\(c^{-6}\\). So, each term in the second expansion has a coefficient, and when multiplied by the 6 from the first part, each of these coefficients becomes part of the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), where \\(k\\) is the exponent from the second part. But the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, does that mean we need to sum all these coefficients? Because each term \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) would have a coefficient of 6 times the coefficient from the second expansion.\n\nWait, but that would mean the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the sum of all the coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by 6. Since the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion is 64, the total coefficient would be 6 * 64 = 384. So, is that the answer?\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think differently. The problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), treating \\(c\\) as another variable. So, in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire second expansion. But that doesn't make sense because the second expansion is a polynomial in \\(c\\), not a constant.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to consider that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, and then the entire second expansion is a separate factor, so the coefficient is 6 times the entire second expansion. But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient.\n\nI think I'm getting confused here. Let me try to clarify. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When we expand this, each term will be of the form \\(\\text{term from first expansion} \\times \\text{term from second expansion}\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), \\(a^2b^2c^2\\), \\(a^2b^2\\), \\(a^2b^2c^{-2}\\), etc. \n\nBut the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, does that mean we need to consider all the terms where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero? Because only then would the term be \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) involved. \n\nWait, that makes sense. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is actually the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product. Therefore, we need to find the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, which would be the constant term in the second expansion. \n\nSo, first, find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, as I found earlier. Then, find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nTo find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), I can use the binomial theorem again. The general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We want the exponent of \\(c\\) to be zero, so set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). \n\nTherefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. \n\nNow, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficients from each part, which is 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is 120.\n\nWait, let me double-check that. So, in the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6. In the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the constant term is when \\(k = 3\\), which gives \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, multiplying these gives 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nYes, that seems correct. I think I was confused earlier because I was considering all the terms, but the problem specifically asks for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which implies that we're looking for the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, so that the term is just \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient is 120.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the coefficient is 6 from the first part and 20 from the second part, multiplied together to get 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is found by considering the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\n1. From \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n2. From \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the constant term is when \\(k = 3\\), giving \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n3. Multiplying these together: \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

    "text": " I'm a bit new to this, so I might make some mistakes, but I'll try to correct them as I go.\n\nFirst, I think I can break this problem into two parts because the expression is a product of two binomials raised to different powers. So, maybe I can expand each part separately and then multiply the terms together. But wait, the question is specifically asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). That term doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), so maybe I don't need to expand the entire expression. Instead, I can focus on the parts that will contribute to \\(a^2b^2\\) when multiplied together.\n\nLet me start by looking at the first part: \\((a + b)^4\\). I remember from the binomial theorem that \\((a + b)^n\\) expands to a sum of terms of the form \\(\\dbinom{n}{k}a^{n - k}b^k\\), where \\(k\\) ranges from 0 to \\(n\\). So, for \\((a + b)^4\\), the expansion will have terms from \\(a^4\\) down to \\(b^4\\), each multiplied by a binomial coefficient.\n\nSince I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I can find the term where the powers of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2 each. Let me calculate the binomial coefficient for this term. The general term is \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}a^{4 - k}b^k\\), so when \\(k = 2\\), the term is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}a^{2}b^{2}\\). \n\nCalculating \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\): that's 4! / (2! * (4 - 2)!) = (24)/(2 * 2) = 24 / 4 = 6. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\nOkay, that's the first part. Now, moving on to the second part: \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I need to figure out how this part contributes to the overall coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). But wait, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't have any \\(c\\) in it. So, when I multiply the two expansions together, the only way \\(a^2b^2\\) can appear is if I take the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion and multiply it by a term that's just a constant (i.e., doesn't involve \\(c\\)) from the second expansion. Because if I take any term from the second expansion that has \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), then the resulting term would have \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2 \\cdot c^{-k}\\), which isn't what we want.\n\nSo, in other words, I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because when I multiply that constant term by \\(a^2b^2\\), I'll get \\(a^2b^2\\) times that constant, which is exactly the term we're looking for.\n\nAlright, so now the problem reduces to finding the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me think about how to do that.\n\nAgain, using the binomial theorem, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) expands to the sum from \\(k = 0\\) to \\(k = 6\\) of \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k\\). Simplifying each term, that becomes \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - k}c^{-k}\\) which is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\\).\n\nNow, we're looking for the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, because that's the constant term. So, we set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\) so \\(k = 3\\).\n\nSo, the constant term is when \\(k = 3\\), and the term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}c^{0} = \\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Let me calculate that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\) is 6! / (3! * 3!) = (720)/(6 * 6) = 720 / 36 = 20. So, the constant term is 20.\n\nWait, let me double-check that calculation because I might have made a mistake. 6! is 720, 3! is 6, so 720 divided by (6 * 6) is indeed 720 / 36, which is 20. Yep, that's correct.\n\nSo, the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20.\n\nNow, going back to the original problem: the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nFrom earlier, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the constant term in the other expansion is 20. So, multiplying these together: 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, that seems straightforward, but let me make sure I didn't miss anything. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion is 6a\u00b2b\u00b2, and the constant term in the second expansion is 20. When you multiply these two, you get 6 * 20 * a\u00b2b\u00b2, which is 120a\u00b2b\u00b2. So, the coefficient is indeed 120.\n\nIs there any other term that could contribute to \\(a^2b^2\\) when multiplied by terms from the second expansion? Let me think. If I took a term from the second expansion that's not constant, say, \\(c^k\\) or \\(c^{-k}\\), then the product would have \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2c^{-k}\\), which wouldn't be \\(a^2b^2\\) alone. So, only the constant term contributes to the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the product. Therefore, I don't need to consider any other terms from the second expansion.\n\nJust to recap, the steps I took were:\n\n1. Recognize that the problem involves two separate binomial expansions.\n2. Identify that the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first expansion, so I found its coefficient using the binomial theorem.\n3. Since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), I needed the constant term from the second expansion to multiply with it, ensuring that the resulting term is just \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) factors.\n4. Found the constant term by setting the exponent of \\(c\\) to zero in the second expansion, solving for the appropriate term, and calculating its coefficient.\n5. Multiplied the two coefficients together to get the final coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression.\n\nI think that covers everything. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning, but let me just quickly check each step again.\n\n- Coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\): \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Correct.\n- Constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\): Found when exponent is zero, which is at \\(k = 3\\), so \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Correct.\n- Multiplying 6 and 20 gives 120. Correct.\n\nSo, yeah, I think the coefficient is 120. I can't see any other way this could be approached, so I think I'm confident with this answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break the problem into two parts:\n\n1. **Finding the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\):**\n   Using the binomial theorem, the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) includes the term \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}a^2b^2\\). Calculating the binomial coefficient:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} = \\frac{4!}{2! \\cdot 2!} = \\frac{24}{4} = 6\n   \\]\n   So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\n2. **Finding the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   Using the binomial theorem, the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) includes terms of the form \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\\). We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, which occurs when \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\) gives \\(k = 3\\). The constant term is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{6}{3} = \\frac{6!}{3! \\cdot 3!} = \\frac{720}{36} = 20\n   \\]\n\n3. **Combining the results:**\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is the product of the coefficient from the first part and the constant term from the second part:\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 20 = 120\n   \\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

That means I need to find the term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) where the powers of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2. Let me write that down.\n\nSo, for \\((a + b)^4\\), the general term is \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}a^{4 - k}b^{k}\\). I need the term where \\(a^2b^2\\), so that would mean \\(4 - k = 2\\) for \\(a\\) and \\(k = 2\\) for \\(b\\). Let me check: if \\(k = 2\\), then the term is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}a^{2}b^{2}\\). \n\nCalculating \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\), which is the number of combinations of 4 things taken 2 at a time. I think that's 6 because 4 choose 2 is 6. So the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. Okay, that part seems straightforward.\n\nNow, the expression also has another part: \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I wonder if I need to expand this as well. Wait, but the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, does the second part affect this? Hmm, maybe not directly because \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\). So, perhaps the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just 6, and the rest of the expression is multiplied by that term. Let me think.\n\nWait, no, that doesn't seem right. Because the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), so when you multiply these two expansions together, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), maybe we don't need to worry about the other variables \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). Because \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), so the coefficient would just be 6 multiplied by whatever is the coefficient of the term that doesn't involve \\(c\\) in the second expansion. But wait, in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the only term that doesn't involve \\(c\\) is the constant term, right?\n\nWait, let me check that. If I expand \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term will be of the form \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - k}(1/c)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, the exponent of \\(c\\) is \\(6 - 2k\\). For the term to be a constant (i.e., \\(c^0\\)), we need \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\). So, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}c^{0} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of the constant term is 20.\n\nTherefore, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part will be multiplied by the constant term 20 in the second part. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, let me make sure I didn't miss anything. So, the first part gives me 6 for \\(a^2b^2\\), and the second part gives me 20 for the constant term, so when I multiply these together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) gets multiplied by 20, making the coefficient 120. That seems correct.\n\nBut wait, another thought: is the entire expression just the product of the two expansions, so each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, when looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I'm only interested in the terms where the product results in \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. But since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) is to multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part by the constant term from the second part. So, yes, that would be 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of it as the product of the two polynomials, and the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be the product of the coefficients of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and the constant term in the second part. That makes sense because when you multiply polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term is the sum of the products of coefficients of terms that multiply together to give that term. But in this case, since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the only way to get it is by multiplying \\(a^2b^2\\) by the constant term. So, that would be 6 * 20.\n\nWait, but let me check if I made a mistake in calculating \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\) is 20, yes, because 6*5*4/(3*2*1) = 20. So that's correct.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nI think that's it. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning, so I'm confident that the coefficient is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe problem asks for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem**:\n   - The general term is \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}a^{4 - k}b^{k}\\).\n   - For \\(a^2b^2\\), set \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\), giving the term \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}a^2b^2\\).\n   - \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\), so the coefficient is 6.\n\n2. **Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem**:\n   - The general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - k}\\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\\).\n   - To find the constant term (where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0), set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), giving \\(k = 3\\).\n   - The constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n\n3. **Combine the results**:\n   - The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n   - The constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20.\n   - Multiply these coefficients: \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is 120.\n\n\\boxed{120}"

But wait, that doesn't seem right because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, which might involve some combination from both expansions.\n\nWait, no, actually, I think I'm overcomplicating it. Because \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are in one part, and \\(c\\) is in another part, so when you multiply them together, the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are independent of the terms involving \\(c\\).

So, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that can't be right because the problem is asking for a specific coefficient, not a sum.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think again. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), so perhaps the coefficient is just 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't make sense because the coefficient should be a number, not an expression involving \\(c\\). So, maybe I'm missing something here.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me re-examine the problem. It says: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, actually, when you expand the entire product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by each term from the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because each term in the second expansion is a coefficient times a power of \\(c\\), and when you multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), the coefficient becomes 6 times that coefficient.\n\nBut wait, that doesn't seem right because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would include all the terms from the second expansion. So, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nWait, but the sum of the coefficients in a polynomial is found by setting all variables to 1. So, if I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = (1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times 64, which is 384.\n\nWait, but that seems too straightforward. Let me double-check. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part has a coefficient of 6, and when you multiply it by each term in the second part, which is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the second part has a coefficient. So, when you multiply, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) times each term in the second expansion would be 6 times each coefficient. But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, it's actually the sum of all those coefficients multiplied by 6.\n\nWait, but that would mean the coefficient is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 times 64, as I thought earlier, giving 384. Hmm, that seems high, but maybe that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Maybe it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, considering that the product would have terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2/c^k\\). But the problem just says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", without specifying any \\(c\\) terms. That suggests that perhaps the problem is only considering the coefficient when multiplied by \\(c^0\\), so that the term is \\(a^2b^2\\) times 1, so the coefficient would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion.\n\nWait, that makes more sense. Because if you're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, you have to consider that each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part would be multiplied by each term in the second part, which includes various powers of \\(c\\). But if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then it's actually the sum of all the coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by 6. But if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), then it's 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion.\n\nWait, the problem statement is a bit ambiguous. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which would include all terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present, regardless of the power of \\(c\\). But in reality, when you multiply two polynomials, each term from the first is multiplied by each term from the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, which includes terms like \\(c^6\\), \\(c^4\\), down to \\(c^{-6}\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would actually be the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all coefficients from the second part, which is 64, as I thought earlier. So, the coefficient would be 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nBut wait, let me think again. If the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then yes, it's 384. But if it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), then it's 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion.\n\nWait, but the problem didn't specify any \\(c\\) terms, so I think it's the first case, where we're considering all terms with \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) part. So, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nBut let me verify that. Let's consider a simpler case. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^1 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, expanding, we get \\(a(c + 1/c) + b(c + 1/c)\\). The coefficient of \\(a\\) would be \\(c + 1/c\\), and similarly for \\(b\\). But if we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a\\), regardless of \\(c\\), it's just \\(c + 1/c\\). But if we set \\(c = 1\\), then the coefficient would be 2. Hmm, but that's a different interpretation.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\). That would make more sense because otherwise, the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\), not a single number. So, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be the term where the exponents of \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are 2, 2, and 0, respectively.\n\nIf that's the case, then I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product. So, that would require considering the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part and multiplying it by the term \\(c^0\\) from the second part.\n\nSo, first, let's find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which we already did: it's 6.\n\nNext, we need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by \\(c^0\\), you get \\(a^2b^2\\), which is the term we're interested in.\n\nSo, how do we find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)? Let's use the binomial theorem again. The expansion is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\).\n\nWe need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be 0, so we set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\).\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\), which is \\(\\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\).\n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion is 20.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire product is the product of the coefficients from each part: 6 (from the first expansion) times 20 (from the second expansion), which is 120.\n\nWait, so I think I initially misunderstood the problem. It's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, but considering that the product includes \\(c\\) terms, so the term \\(a^2b^2\\) must be multiplied by \\(c^0\\) to have the term \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nLet me double-check that. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\) with coefficient 6, and the term \\(c^0\\) comes from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) with coefficient 20. So, when multiplied together, the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem had asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without considering \\(c\\), then it would have been 6 times the entire sum of coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. But I think that's not the case here because the problem is more likely asking for the coefficient when \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\), making it a specific term.\n\nSo, I think the correct answer is 120.\n\nWait, just to make sure, let me think about how the product works. When you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part, which includes \\(c^6\\), \\(6c^4\\), \\(15c^2\\), \\(20c^0\\), \\(15c^{-2}\\), \\(6c^{-4}\\), and \\(c^{-6}\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is 6 * 20 = 120, as we found earlier. So, that's the coefficient for the term \\(a^2b^2c^0\\).\n\nBut if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, then it would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. But I think the problem is more likely asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), so 120.\n\nWait, but the problem didn't specify any \\(c\\) terms, so maybe it's indeed asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) irrespective of the \\(c\\) part. That would mean the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of the second part, which is 6 * 64 = 384. But that seems a bit odd because the coefficient would then be a polynomial in \\(c\\), but the problem is asking for a single coefficient, not a polynomial.\n\nHmm, I'm getting a bit confused here. Let me think about it differently. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. The product is a polynomial in variables \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\). So, when they say \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", they might mean the coefficient when \\(c\\) is raised to the power of 0, because otherwise, the coefficient would vary depending on the power of \\(c\\).\n\nAlternatively, maybe they just want the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which would be the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by 6. But that would result in a coefficient that's a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the coefficient should be a scalar.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is written in a way that it's actually considering the product as a single polynomial, and they're asking for the coefficient of the term \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) part. But in reality, each term in the product will have some combination of \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would have coefficients multiplied by various powers of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is actually a polynomial in \\(c\\), where each term corresponds to a different power of \\(c\\).\n\nBut the problem is asking for the coefficient, which is a number, so maybe they're asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120, as we calculated earlier.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it, and the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and then the second part is just a distraction. But that doesn't make sense because the problem includes both parts in the product.\n\nWait, no, the problem is the product of both expressions, so we have to consider both expansions. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, which includes various powers of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 times each coefficient from the second expansion, but that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a single coefficient.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when considering the entire product as a single expression, but without any \\(c\\) terms. So, perhaps they're asking for the constant term with respect to \\(c\\), i.e., the term where \\(c^0\\), which would be \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by the constant term from the second expansion.\n\nSo, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times 20, which is 120.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable, so the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of the second part, which would be a polynomial. But the problem is asking for a coefficient, which is a number, so that can't be right.\n\nI think the most reasonable interpretation is that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. So, I'll go with that.\n\nSo, to recap:\n\n1. Find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6.\n2. Find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20.\n3. Multiply these coefficients together: 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 120.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me think about another approach. Maybe I can consider the entire product and look for the term \\(a^2b^2c^0\\).\n\nSo, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\) and has a coefficient of 6. The term \\(c^0\\) comes from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) and has a coefficient of 20. So, when you multiply these two terms together, you get \\(6 \\times 20 \\times a^2b^2c^0\\), which is \\(120a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient is 120.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So, I think I've got it right.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break down the problem into two parts:\n\n1. **Finding the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\):**\n   Using the binomial theorem, the general term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is given by:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k} b^k\n   \\]\n   We need the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2.

    "text": " I'm a bit confused at first, but I think I can break it down.\n\nFirst, I remember that when you have an expression like \\((a + b)^n\\), you can expand it using the binomial theorem. The binomial theorem says that each term in the expansion is of the form \\(\\dbinom{n}{k} a^{n - k}b^k\\), where \\(\\dbinom{n}{k}\\) is the binomial coefficient, which can be found using combinations. So, maybe I can apply that here.\n\nThe problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). That means I need to find the term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) where \\(a\\) is squared and \\(b\\) is also squared. Let me write down the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem.\n\nThe general term in the expansion is \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\\). I need the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2. So, that would mean \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). Let me check that: if \\(k = 2\\), then \\(4 - 2 = 2\\), so the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2. Perfect.\n\nSo, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Let me calculate that. \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) is equal to \\(\\dfrac{4!}{2!2!}\\), which is \\(\\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient is 6.\n\nWait, but the original expression isn't just \\((a + b)^4\\), it's multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Hmm, so I need to consider the entire expression. But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). That suggests that I don't need to worry about the terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) because \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\). Or maybe I do? Let me think.\n\nWait, no, actually, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when we multiply these two expansions together, each term from \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), we can consider that term separately. Because \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term that comes only from the \\((a + b)^4\\) part, and when multiplied by any term from the other expansion, it will still be \\(a^2b^2\\) times something involving \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so maybe it's just the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\), regardless of the other part? Hmm, that doesn't seem right.\n\nWait, no, I think I'm misunderstanding. Let me clarify: when you multiply two expressions, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by every term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\). So, actually, the only way \\(a^2b^2\\) can appear in the product is if it's multiplied by a term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) that is 1, because \\(c^0 = 1\\). So, we need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because that's the only term that won't introduce any \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\) factors. Then, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression will be the product of the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) and the constant term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nSo, first, let me find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which I already did and it's 6. Then, I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me figure that out.\n\nAgain, using the binomial theorem, the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) will have terms of the form \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k\\). Simplifying that, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} c^{-k} = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\).\n\nWe want the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, because that's the constant term. So, we set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(6 = 2k\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\).\n\nCalculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20.\n\nNow, going back to the original expression, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part has a coefficient of 6, and it's multiplied by the constant term 20 from the second part. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nWait, let me make sure I didn't miss anything. So, the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) for \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, and the constant term from the other expansion is 20. Multiplying them gives 120. That seems right.\n\nJust to double-check, maybe I can think of it another way. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). When expanding, each term from the first part is multiplied by each term from the second part. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) can only come from the first part, and it's multiplied by all terms from the second part. But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the other variables, I think we're considering it as a term in the expanded form, so it's multiplied by the constant term. So, yes, 6 times 20 is 120.\n\nI think that's it. So, the coefficient is 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break down the problem into two parts.\n\nFirst, we use the binomial theorem to expand \\((a + b)^4\\). The general term in the expansion is given by:\n\\[\n\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n\\]\nWe need the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2. This corresponds to \\(k = 2\\):\n\\[\n\\dbinom{4}{2} a^{2}b^{2}\n\\]\nCalculating the binomial coefficient:\n\\[\n\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\n\\]\nSo, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\nNext, we consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The general term in this expansion is:\n\\[\n\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n\\]\nWe need the constant term, which occurs when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero:\n\\[\n6 - 2k = 0 \\implies k = 3\n\\]\nThe constant term is:\n\\[\n\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\n\\]\n\nFinally, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficients from the two expansions:\n\\[\n6 \\times 20 = 120\n\\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

Since I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term in the first part, I might need to consider how the terms from the first part interact with the terms from the second part.

But wait, that can't be right because the second part has terms with \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), so when I multiply, the terms involving \\(c\\) would affect the overall expression. But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). Hmm, so maybe I need to consider all the terms in the second expansion and then find the total contribution to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). \n\nWait, no. Let me think again. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, when I expand this, each term in the expansion will be of the form \\((a^kb^{4 - k}) \\times (c^m (1/c)^{6 - m})\\), which simplifies to \\(a^kb^{4 - k} c^{m - (6 - m)} = a^kb^{4 - k} c^{2m - 6}\\). \n\nBut the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, I need to find all terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) appears, regardless of the power of \\(c\\). That means I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and then multiply it by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), because each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). \n\nWait, but that doesn't seem right because the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient in the first part times the sum of all coefficients in the second part. But that would be if I'm combining the terms. Alternatively, maybe I can treat the two expansions as independent and realize that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). \n\nWait, but the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) would be found by setting \\(c = 1\\), so \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, if that's the case, then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times 64. \n\nLet me check this approach. So, first, find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\). Using the binomial theorem, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\), which is 6. Then, the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 64, as I found by setting \\(c = 1\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nWait, but I'm not sure if that's correct because when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each polynomial. But in this case, the terms in the first polynomial are \\(a^kb^{4 - k}\\), and the terms in the second are \\(c^m (1/c)^{6 - m}\\). So, when I multiply, the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from those involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would indeed be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part, because each term in the first part is multiplied by every term in the second part, including the constant term. \n\nWait, but actually, no, because the second part doesn't have a constant term. Let me see: \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) when expanded will have terms like \\(c^6\\), \\(c^4\\), \\(c^2\\), \\(1\\), \\(c^{-2}\\), \\(c^{-4}\\), \\(c^{-6}\\). So, there is a constant term when \\(m = 3\\), because \\(c^{2m - 6}\\) becomes \\(c^{0}\\) when \\(2m - 6 = 0\\), so \\(m = 3\\). So, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, the sum of all coefficients in the second part is 64, as I found before, but the constant term is 20. \n\nWait, but in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times each term in the second expansion. But that doesn't make sense because the coefficient of a specific term in the product should be the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each polynomial. \n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think differently. Since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), I can treat the two parts as separate and realize that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Because when you multiply, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by every term in the second, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient from the first part times the sum of coefficients from the second part. \n\nBut let me confirm that. Suppose I have two polynomials, P(a, b) and Q(c). Then, the product P(a, b) * Q(c) will have terms where each term in P is multiplied by each term in Q. So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of a specific term in P, say \\(a^2b^2\\), then in the product, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in P multiplied by each term in Q, but since Q is in terms of c, the coefficient in the product would be the coefficient in P times the entire Q. But that can't be right because the product would have terms involving both a, b, and c. \n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. The problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\" in the entire expression. But in the entire expression, which includes terms with c and 1/c, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) can be multiplied by any power of c. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), because each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by every term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), and we're interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the c terms. \n\nWait, but that seems to make sense. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the sum of all coefficients in the second part. \n\nSo, first, let's find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\). Using the binomial theorem, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\), which is 6. \n\nNext, the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), so \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). \n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). \n\nWait, but earlier I thought that the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 20. So, if I set \\(c = 1\\), I get 64, which is the sum of all coefficients, including the constant term. So, that part checks out. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of it as the product of the two coefficients. Since the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part has a coefficient of 6, and the entire second part is a polynomial in c, so when multiplied, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which is 64, giving 384. \n\nWait, but I'm not entirely sure if that's the correct approach. Let me try another way. \n\nLet me expand both parts separately and then see how the terms interact. \n\nFirst, expanding \\((a + b)^4\\):\n\nUsing the binomial theorem, this is:\n\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k} b^k\n\\]\n\nSo, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\), so the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n\nNext, expanding \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):\n\nAgain, using the binomial theorem:\n\n\\[\n\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n\\]\n\nSo, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\).\n\nNow, when we multiply these two expansions together, each term in the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the product will have terms of the form:\n\n\\[\n\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k} b^k \\times \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n\\]\n\nWhich simplifies to:\n\n\\[\n\\dbinom{4}{k} \\dbinom{6}{m} a^{4 - k} b^k c^{6 - 2m}\n\\]\n\nNow, we are interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, we need to find all terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) appears, regardless of the power of \\(c\\). \n\nIn the first expansion, \\(a^2b^2\\) occurs when \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\), so \\(k = 2\\). The coefficient here is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n\nIn the second expansion, since we're multiplying by all terms, each term in the second expansion will contribute a factor to the coefficient. Therefore, the total coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part. \n\nWait, that's what I thought earlier. So, the sum of all coefficients in the second part is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). \n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). \n\nBut let me double-check this approach because I might be making a mistake here. \n\nAnother way to think about it is that when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum of the products of the coefficients of terms whose exponents add up to the desired exponent. But in this case, since the variables are different (a, b vs. c), the exponents don't interfere with each other. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is simply the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial and the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial. \n\nYes, that makes sense because each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 64. \n\nTherefore, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). \n\nWait, but just to be thorough, let me compute the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial again. \n\nThe second polynomial is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). To find the sum of all coefficients, I can substitute \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, that's correct. \n\nAlternatively, I can compute the sum by expanding the polynomial:\n\n\\[\n\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} = 2^6 = 64\n\\]\n\nSo, that's correct. \n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). \n\nI think that's the correct answer. Let me just recap to make sure I didn't miss anything. \n\n1. Find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\): that's \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n2. Find the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\): that's \\(2^6 = 64\\).\n3. Multiply these two results: \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, the coefficient is 384.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{384}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break down the problem into two parts using the binomial theorem.\n\n1. **Finding the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\):**\n\n   Using the binomial theorem, the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is:\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k} b^k\n   \\]\n   The term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\), so the coefficient is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\n   \\]\n\n2. **Finding the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n\n   Using the binomial theorem, the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is:\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n   \\]\n   The sum of all coefficients is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives:\n   \\[\n   \\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\n   \\]\n\n3. **Combining the results:**\n\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 64 = 384\n   \\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{384}\\)."

    "text": " \n\nFirst, I remember that when you have an expression raised to a power like \\((a + b)^n\\), you can expand it using the binomial theorem. The binomial theorem says that \\((a + b)^n = \\sum_{k=0}^{n} \\dbinom{n}{k} a^{n - k} b^{k}\\). So, maybe I can use that here for both parts of the expression.\n\nThe given expression has two parts multiplied together: \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I think I can handle each part separately and then see how they combine. \n\nLet me start with the first part: \\((a + b)^4\\). Using the binomial theorem, I can expand this. I need to find the term where \\(a^2b^2\\). So, I need to find the coefficient when \\(a^2b^2\\) appears in this expansion.\n\nIn the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\), the general term is \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k} b^{k}\\). I want the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2. That means \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). So, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\).\n\nCalculating that, \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\nWait, but the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, does that affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)? Hmm, I think so because when you multiply two expressions, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression.\n\nBut actually, the problem is asking only for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). That term is in the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), and the second part involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), which don't have \\(a\\) or \\(b\\). So, when we multiply the two parts together, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will be multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nBut wait, does that mean the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just 6 times the entire expansion of the second part? That doesn't seem right because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not considering the \\(c\\) terms. Maybe I'm misunderstanding.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think again. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when you multiply these two, each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nBut the question is only about the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, in the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, as I found earlier. Now, in the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), when expanded, it will have terms like \\(c^6\\), \\(6c^4\\), \\(15c^2\\), \\(20\\), \\(15c^{-2}\\), \\(6c^{-4}\\), and \\(c^{-6}\\). \n\nBut when we multiply these together, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. However, the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, does that mean the coefficient will be 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion?\n\nWait, that doesn't make sense because the second expansion's coefficients are specific to each power of \\(c\\). But since the problem isn't asking for a specific power of \\(c\\), maybe it's just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times the entire second expression. But that doesn't seem right either.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misinterpreting the problem. Maybe it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), because if you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by some term in the second expansion, you might get a term like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some \\(k\\). But the problem just says \\(a^2b^2\\), which might imply \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), so the term where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is considering the entire expression as a polynomial in \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\), and \\(1/c\\), and it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). But that seems odd because typically, when you have multiple variables, you specify all the exponents.\n\nWait, maybe I should look at the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, perhaps it's considering the entire expression as a product, and it's asking for the coefficient of the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) appears, regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire second part, because when you multiply, each term in the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part.\n\nBut that would mean the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that can't be right because the problem is expecting a numerical coefficient, not a polynomial.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times some term in \\(c\\). But since it's not specified, maybe it's just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\). But that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 times \\(2^6 = 64\\), so 384. But that seems too high.\n\nWait, no, that doesn't make sense because the second expansion is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which when expanded, has terms with coefficients that sum up to \\(2^6 = 64\\), but each term is multiplied by a power of \\(c\\). So, when you multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times each coefficient in the second expansion, but that would give multiple terms with \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), each with their own coefficients.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Perhaps it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, which would require considering all possible terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. But that seems complicated.\n\nWait, no, perhaps the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating \\(c\\) as another variable. So, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, because each term in the second expansion is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the total coefficient would be 6 * (sum of coefficients in the second expansion).\n\nThe sum of coefficients in the second expansion is found by plugging in \\(c = 1\\), so \\(\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the total coefficient would be 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nBut wait, that seems too straightforward. Alternatively, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without considering the \\(c\\) terms, which would mean that the coefficient is 6, as that's the coefficient from the first part, and the second part is just a separate polynomial. But that doesn't seem right because the entire expression is a product, so the coefficients would multiply.\n\nWait, perhaps I should think of it differently. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when you multiply these two, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), etc. So, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then it's the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by 6.\n\nBut that would be 6 * (sum of coefficients in the second expansion). As I calculated before, the sum of coefficients in the second expansion is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is \\(a^2b^2\\), then we need to find the term where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out. So, in the second expansion, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term with \\(c^0\\) is the middle term. Let me find that.\n\nUsing the binomial theorem again, the general term in the expansion is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We want the exponent of \\(c\\) to be 0, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\). So, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n\nSo, the term with \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire expression is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, so which interpretation is correct? Is the problem asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), which would be 384, or the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120?\n\nLooking back at the problem: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" It doesn't specify any particular power of \\(c\\), so it's ambiguous. But typically, when you're asked for the coefficient of a term with specific variables, it's implied that the other variables are set to their exponents, so perhaps \\(c^0\\). So, maybe the answer is 120.\n\nBut let me think again. If the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then it's 6 * 64 = 384. But that seems unlikely because the problem includes both \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), so it's probably expecting a specific term where \\(c\\) cancels out.\n\nWait, but maybe the problem is just treating \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\), and \\(1/c\\) as separate variables, and it's asking for the coefficient of the monomial \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. In that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nBut I'm not sure. Let me check with an example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^1 \\times (c + 1/c)^1 = (a + b)(c + 1/c)\\). If I expand this, I get \\(ac + a/c + bc + b/c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^1b^0\\) is \\(c + 1/c\\), which is not a numerical coefficient. Similarly, the coefficient of \\(a^0b^1\\) is also \\(c + 1/c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient of a term with \\(a\\) or \\(b\\) is a polynomial in \\(c\\).\n\nBut in the problem, we're looking for a numerical coefficient, so perhaps the problem is expecting that we consider the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by \\(c^0\\), so that the coefficient is a number, not a polynomial.\n\nTherefore, I think the correct approach is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but let me make sure. Let me consider the entire expansion. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\), and it's multiplied by each term from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 times each term from the second expansion, but each of those terms has a different power of \\(c\\). So, unless the problem is asking for a specific power of \\(c\\), the coefficient isn't a single number but a polynomial.\n\nBut the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which suggests that it's looking for the coefficient when considering all powers of \\(c\\). But that doesn't make sense because the coefficient would vary depending on the power of \\(c\\). Therefore, I think the problem must be asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is a specific term.\n\nSo, to find that, I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), then multiply them together.\n\nAs I found earlier, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part is 20. So, multiplying them gives 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is 120. Since the problem didn't specify the power of \\(c\\), but just asked for \\(a^2b^2\\), I think this is the intended answer.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. If I expand the entire expression, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), etc. So, each of these terms has a different power of \\(c\\). Therefore, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), that would mean adding up all the coefficients from the second expansion and multiplying by 6, which would be 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nBut that seems too large, and also, typically, when you're asked for the coefficient of a specific term, you're considering a specific combination of exponents. So, I think the correct interpretation is that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nWait, but maybe I should confirm. Let me think about the structure of the problem. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). If I were to write out the entire expansion, each term would be of the form \\(a^kb^{4 - k}c^{6 - 2m}\\), where \\(k\\) ranges from 0 to 4 and \\(m\\) ranges from 0 to 6. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would correspond to \\(k = 2\\), and we need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be 0, which happens when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), so \\(m = 3\\).\n\nTherefore, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) times \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\), which is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is 120. Since the problem didn't specify the power of \\(c\\), but just asked for \\(a^2b^2\\), I think it's safe to assume that it's asking for the term where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out, i.e., \\(c^0\\).\n\nTherefore, the final answer should be 120.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break the problem into two parts:\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   The term \\(a^2b^2\\) is found when the binomial coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n\n2. **Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) and find the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0:**\n   Using the binomial theorem, the term with \\(c^0\\) occurs when \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), so \\(k = 3\\).

The binomial theorem says that each term in the expansion is of the form \\(\\dbinom{n}{k}a^{n - k}b^k\\), where \\(k\\) goes from 0 to \\(n\\). So, maybe I can apply that here for the \\((a + b)^4\\) part.\n\nLet me write that down. For \\((a + b)^4\\), the expansion will have terms like \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}a^{4 - k}b^k\\) for \\(k = 0\\) to \\(4\\). I'm looking for the term where \\(a^2b^2\\), so that means \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\).

Let me think again. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product. But \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), so maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Perhaps I just need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and then, since it's multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the whole expression would just be 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. But that doesn't make sense because then the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\), not a single number.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, considering all terms, but since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), maybe the coefficient is just 6, and the rest of the terms involve \\(c\\). But that seems too simple. Let me check.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. But that doesn't make much sense because in the product, each term from \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, I think that would mean considering all possible terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any term from the second expansion. But that would result in a coefficient that is a sum over all possible coefficients from the second expansion. Hmm, that seems more complicated.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me try to approach it differently. Let's consider the entire expression as a product of two separate expansions. The first expansion is \\((a + b)^4\\), and the second is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When you multiply them together, each term from the first expansion gets multiplied by each term from the second expansion.\n\nSo, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), that would come from the term in \\((a + b)^4\\) where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by every possible term in the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't give a single number; it gives a polynomial in \\(c\\). So, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating \\(c\\) as a variable, but that seems odd because the problem didn't specify any particular term in \\(c\\). Wait, perhaps I'm misinterpreting the problem.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some \\(k\\), but it just says \\(a^2b^2\\). Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, considering all possible terms, but that doesn't make sense because each term would involve both \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) and some power of \\(c\\). So, maybe the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the part that doesn't involve \\(c\\), but that seems unclear.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Maybe the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), and that's it, without considering the second part. But that seems too easy because then the answer would just be 6. But the problem includes the second part, so I must be missing something.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is written correctly, and I need to consider the entire product. So, let me try to think again. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when I expand this, each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part will be multiplied by every term in the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean that the coefficient isn't a single number but a polynomial. Hmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating \\(c\\) as a variable, so the coefficient would be an expression involving \\(c\\). But that seems a bit strange because the problem didn't specify any particular term in \\(c\\). Alternatively, maybe the problem is expecting the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, but that would require summing over all possible coefficients from the second expansion, which might not make sense.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Let me try to think differently. Maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, but since \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) are separate variables, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) can only come from the first part, and the second part doesn't affect it. So, maybe the coefficient is just 6, as I calculated earlier.\n\nWait, but that seems too simple, and the problem includes the second part, so maybe I'm missing something. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, which would mean that I need to consider the product of the two expansions and find the coefficient where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2 each, regardless of the exponents of \\(c\\). But that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all terms in the second expansion, which would be 6 times \\(2^6\\) because \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) evaluated at \\(c = 1\\) is \\(2^6 = 64\\). Wait, but that seems like an evaluation, not the coefficient.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me try to approach it step by step.\n\nFirst, let's handle the \\((a + b)^4\\) part. The expansion is:\n\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k} b^k\n\\]\n\nWe're interested in the term where \\(a^2b^2\\), so \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). The coefficient here is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\), as I found before.\n\nNow, the second part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let's expand this using the binomial theorem as well:\n\n\\[\n\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n\\]\n\nSo, each term in this expansion is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\) for \\(m = 0\\) to \\(6\\).\n\nNow, when we multiply the two expansions together, each term from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term from the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by every term in the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product will be 6 times the entire expansion of the second part. But that can't be right because the coefficient should be a single number, not a polynomial.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some specific \\(k\\), but the problem statement just says \\(a^2b^2\\). Alternatively, perhaps I'm misinterpreting the problem, and it's actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable, but that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't seem right.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Maybe the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), and that's it, regardless of the second part. But that seems too straightforward, and the problem includes both parts, so I must be missing something.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is written incorrectly, and it's actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where \\(c\\) cancels out to \\(c^0\\). Let me check that.\n\nIf that's the case, then I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product. So, in that case, I would take the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part, which is 6, and multiply it by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) from the second part.\n\nSo, in the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term where \\(c^0\\) occurs is when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), so \\(m = 3\\). The coefficient here is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) would be \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nWait, that makes sense. So, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, but considering only the terms where \\(c\\) cancels out, i.e., \\(c^0\\). That would make the coefficient 120.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem is indeed asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without any consideration for \\(c\\), then the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of the second part, which would be 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems unlikely because the problem probably expects a numerical coefficient.\n\nSo, putting it all together, I think the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nWait, let me double-check that. The coefficient from the first part is 6, and the coefficient from the second part where \\(c^0\\) is 20, so 6 times 20 is indeed 120.\n\nSo, I think that's the answer. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, considering only the terms where \\(c\\) cancels out, is 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break it down into two parts: expanding \\((a + b)^4\\) and considering the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\n1. **Expanding \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   The term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is given by:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2}a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\n   \\]\n   So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in this part is 6.\n\n2. **Expanding \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   The expansion is:\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n   \\]\n   We are interested in the term where \\(c^0\\) (i.e., the constant term). This occurs when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which gives \\(m = 3\\). The coefficient for this term is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\n   \\]\n\n3. **Combining the results:**\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, considering only the term where \\(c\\) cancels out (i.e., \\(c^0\\)), is the product of the coefficients from each part:\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 20 = 120\n   \\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

That is, I can expand \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) separately and then see how they combine. But wait, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Hmm, but the other part involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), which are different variables. So maybe the \\(c\\) terms don't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms? Or perhaps I'm supposed to consider the entire expression as a product and find the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms? Hmm, that seems a bit confusing.\n\nWait, let me read the problem again. It says, \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, maybe I just need to consider the part of the expansion that has \\(a^2b^2\\), and since the other part is multiplied by that, I can just find the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) and then multiply it by the entire expansion of the other part? Or maybe the other expansion doesn't affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)? Hmm, I'm not sure.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think. When you multiply two expressions together, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression. So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), that term only comes from the product of the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and any term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), maybe the coefficient is just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)? But that doesn't seem right because the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So maybe I don't need to consider the \\(c\\) terms at all when looking for \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, but that can't be right because the entire expression is the product of both parts.\n\nWait, no. Let me think again. When you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) would be multiplied by every term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\), perhaps we're supposed to sum all the coefficients where \\(a^2b^2\\) appears, each multiplied by their corresponding \\(c\\) terms. But that seems complicated, and I'm not sure if that's the case.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Perhaps it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. In other words, if we treat \\(c\\) as another variable, then the coefficient would be the product of the coefficients from each part. Hmm, but I'm not entirely sure. Let me try to think differently.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\), and then, since that term is multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of the other part. But that doesn't make much sense because the coefficient would then be a polynomial in \\(c\\), not just a number. So perhaps I'm overcomplicating it.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\), ignoring the other part, and then the other part is just a constant factor. But that doesn't seem right either because \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) isn't a constant; it's another expression with its own terms.\n\nHmm, perhaps I should approach this differently. Let me consider that the entire expression is a product of two expansions, so when you multiply them, each term from the first expansion is multiplied by each term from the second. So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), that would come from the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by every term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, that doesn't seem right because the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) would be when \\(c = 1\\), which is \\(2^6 = 64\\). So, is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) equal to 64 times the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\)? Hmm, maybe that's the case.\n\nWait, let me check. If I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = (1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, if I substitute \\(c = 1\\), then the entire expression becomes \\((a + b)^4 \\times 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in this case would be 64 times the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\). So, maybe that's the approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), regardless of the other terms. But that seems too simple, and I don't think that's the case because the problem includes both expressions.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me try to break it down. Let's first find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\). Using the binomial theorem, the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is the sum from k=0 to 4 of \\(\\binom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\\). So, the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) occurs is when \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\), so the coefficient is \\(\\binom{4}{2}\\).\n\nCalculating that, \\(\\binom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\nNow, since the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), when we multiply these two, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by every term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would make the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't seem to be what the problem is asking for.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, in other words, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems complicated, and I'm not sure if that's what is being asked.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think differently. Perhaps the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\), ignoring the other part. But that seems too straightforward, and the problem includes both parts, so I don't think that's the case.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, which is a product of two polynomials. So, when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part will be multiplied by every term in the second part. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nWait, that makes sense because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, the coefficient would be the product of 6 (from \\(a^2b^2\\)) and each term in the second expansion. But if we're just looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, then the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, each term contributes a coefficient, and since \\(a^2b^2\\) is being multiplied by each term, the total coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) across all terms would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion.\n\nWait, but the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), right? Because substituting \\(c = 1\\) makes each term equal to its coefficient. So, \\(\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion is 64.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 64 (from the second part), giving 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, that seems plausible, but let me check again. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 64. So, when you multiply the two expressions, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, each contributing their own coefficients. Therefore, the total coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) across all possible \\(c\\) terms would be 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nBut wait, is that the correct approach? Because when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would actually be 6 times each term in the second expansion. So, if you're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, then the coefficient would indeed be 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part, but that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, not a single number. Hmm, that doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a coefficient, which is a single number.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Maybe it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion of the entire product, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, so the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\). But that seems more complicated, and the problem might not be expecting that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and the other part is just a constant factor, but that doesn't make sense because \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) isn't a constant.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), regardless of the other terms, and the presence of the other part is a red herring. But that seems unlikely because the problem includes both expressions.\n\nWait, maybe I should consider that the entire expression is a product, so when you expand it, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of the coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Since the sum of the coefficients is 64, as we saw earlier, then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, so it's just 6, but that seems too simple.\n\nWait, let me think again. The problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when you multiply these two expressions, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, which includes terms like \\(c^6\\), \\(c^4\\), etc., down to \\(c^{-6}\\). So, each of these terms would result in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), etc. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean that the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a single coefficient.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and the other part is just a constant factor, but that doesn't make sense because \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) isn't a constant. So, I must be missing something.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is considering the entire expression as a single polynomial, and we're supposed to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). In that case, the coefficient would be the product of the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) and the sum of all coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 64. So, 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and the other part is irrelevant. But that seems too simple, and I don't think that's the case.\n\nWait, perhaps I should approach this differently. Let me first expand \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) separately and then see how they combine.\n\nStarting with \\((a + b)^4\\), using the binomial theorem, the expansion is:\n\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\binom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n\\]\n\nSo, the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) occurs is when \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\), which gives:\n\n\\[\n\\binom{4}{2} a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\n\\]\n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\nNow, looking at \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), let's expand that using the binomial theorem as well:\n\n\\[\n\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\binom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\binom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n\\]\n\nSo, each term in this expansion is \\(\\binom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\) for \\(m = 0\\) to \\(6\\).\n\nNow, when we multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, resulting in terms like \\(6a^2b^2 \\times \\binom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\).\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the sum of all the coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by 6. That is, the coefficient would be:\n\n\\[\n6 \\times \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\binom{6}{m}\n\\]\n\nBut wait, \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\binom{6}{m}\\) is the sum of the binomial coefficients, which is \\(2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\nWait, that seems to make sense. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 64, so when you multiply them, the coefficient becomes 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can think of it as when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in one polynomial is multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the other polynomial. So, in this case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 64, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me verify this with an example. Suppose I have a simpler case: \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Let's compute this.\n\nFirst, \\((a + b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2\\).\n\nSecond, \\((c + 1/c)^1 = c + 1/c\\).\n\nNow, multiplying them together:\n\n\\[\n(a^2 + 2ab + b^2)(c + 1/c) = a^2c + a^2/c + 2ab c + 2ab/c + b^2c + b^2/c\n\\]\n\nNow, let's find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, in this product, there is no \\(a^2b^2\\) term because the highest power of \\(a\\) is 2 and \\(b\\) is 1 in each term. So, perhaps this example isn't the best.\n\nWait, maybe I should take a different approach. Let me think of it as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and the sum of all coefficients in the second part. So, in the original problem, that would be 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider that when you multiply the two expressions, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the entire expansion of the second part. But that would make the coefficient a polynomial, which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a single coefficient.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and the other part is just a constant. But that doesn't make sense because \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) isn't a constant.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating it again. Let me think: when you have two polynomials multiplied together, the coefficient of a specific term in one polynomial is multiplied by each term in the other polynomial. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would actually be a polynomial in \\(c\\). However, the problem is phrased as \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", which suggests that it's a single number, not a polynomial. Therefore, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, so the coefficient would be a polynomial. But that seems more complicated, and the problem might not be expecting that.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and the other part is just a constant factor. But that doesn't make sense because \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) isn't a constant.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider that the entire expression is a product, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a single coefficient.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try to think differently. Perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and the other part is irrelevant. But that seems too simple, and I don't think that's the case.\n\nWait, another thought: maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, treating \\(c\\) as another variable. So, the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem doesn't specify, so I'm not sure.\n\nWait, maybe I should consider that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). In that case, the coefficient would be the product of the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) and the sum of all coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 64. So, 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and the other part is just a constant factor. But that doesn't make sense because \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) isn't a constant.\n\nWait, I'm going in circles here. Let me try to summarize:\n\n1. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n2. The sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 64.\n3. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nThis seems to be the most plausible answer. So, I think the coefficient is 384.\n\nWait, but let me check with another approach. Let me compute the entire product and see what the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is.\n\nWait, but that might be too time-consuming, but let's try a simplified version. Let me consider that in the product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, each term in the second expansion is \\(\\binom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\) for \\(m = 0\\) to \\(6\\). Therefore, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), each term becomes \\(6 \\times \\binom{6}{m} a^2b^2 c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 times the sum of all \\(\\binom{6}{m}\\) for \\(m = 0\\) to \\(6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, the coefficient is 384.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. Because when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficients multiply term by term, but the coefficient of a specific term in one polynomial is multiplied by all the terms in the other polynomial. So, in this case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and when multiplied by each term in the second expansion, which has coefficients summing to 64, the total coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) across all possible \\(c\\) terms is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nSo, I think that's the correct approach. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 384.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{384}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break down the problem into two parts: expanding \\((a + b)^4\\) and considering the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\n1. **Expanding \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   The expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is given by:\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\binom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term \\(a^2b^2\\) occurs when \\(k = 2\\), and its coefficient is:\n   \\[\n   \\binom{4}{2} = 6\n   \\]\n\n2. **Considering the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   The expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is given by:\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\binom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n   \\]\n   The sum of all coefficients in this expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives:\n   \\[\n   (1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\n   \\]\n\n3. **Combining the results:**\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is the product of the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) and the sum of all coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).

    "text": " I'm a bit confused because the expression has two parts multiplied together, one involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the other involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). But since I'm only asked about the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), maybe I don't need to worry about the \\(c\\) terms? Or do I? Wait, no, actually, the entire expression is multiplied together, so maybe I need to consider both parts. But wait, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\) at all, so maybe the coefficient comes only from the first part, and the second part doesn't affect it. Hmm, that might be the case. Let me think more carefully.\n\nFirst, let's break down the problem. I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the entire expression is a product of two binomial expansions. To find the coefficient of a specific term in the product, I can consider each part separately and then multiply the coefficients, right? Because when you multiply two expressions, the coefficients multiply for the corresponding terms.\n\nBut wait, in this case, the terms in the first part involve \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), while the terms in the second part involve \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). Since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't have any \\(c\\) terms, maybe the coefficient from the second part is just 1, because the only way to get a term without \\(c\\) is if the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. So, perhaps I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) and then multiply it by the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\). That makes sense, I think.\n\nLet me first find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\). I remember that the binomial theorem says that the expansion of \\((x + y)^n\\) is the sum from \\(k = 0\\) to \\(n\\) of \\(\\dbinom{n}{k} x^{n - k} y^k\\). So, applying that here, for \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be when \\(k = 2\\), because \\(a^{4 - 2}b^2 = a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\).\n\nCalculating \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\), that's \\(4! / (2! \\times (4 - 2)!)\\) which is \\((24)/(2 \\times 2) = 24 / 4 = 6\\). So, the coefficient from the first part is 6.\n\nNow, moving on to the second part: \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) here because \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't have any \\(c\\) terms, so when multiplied, the \\(c\\) terms must cancel out. So, I need to find the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero.\n\nUsing the binomial theorem again, the expansion of \\((c + 1/c)^6\\) is the sum from \\(m = 0\\) to \\(6\\) of \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\times (1/c)^m\\). Simplifying that, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\times c^{-m}\\) which is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\).\n\nSo, I need the exponent \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(6 = 2m\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the term where \\(m = 3\\) will have \\(c^0\\), which is the constant term. The coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\).\n\nCalculating \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\), that's \\(6! / (3! \\times 3!)\\) which is \\(720 / (6 \\times 6) = 720 / 36 = 20\\). So, the coefficient from the second part is 20.\n\nNow, since the entire expression is the product of the two expansions, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) will be the product of the coefficients from each part. So, 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the second part) is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nWait, but let me double-check that. Is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product equal to the product of the coefficients from each part? Because when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a term is the sum of the products of coefficients of terms whose exponents add up to that term. But in this case, since the first part has terms with \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the second part has terms with \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), the only way to get a term without any \\(c\\) is by multiplying the term with \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part by the constant term from the second part. So yes, the coefficient is 6 times 20, which is 120.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't miss anything. Is there any other term in the second expansion that could contribute to the constant term? I don't think so because each term in the second expansion is either a positive power of \\(c\\) or a negative power, so the only term with exponent zero is when \\(m = 3\\), as I found earlier. So, the coefficient is indeed 20, and multiplying by 6 gives 120.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of it as expanding both parts and looking for the cross terms, but I think that's more complicated. Since the terms are independent, I can handle each part separately.\n\nWait, another way to check: Let me compute \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) separately and see if the coefficients multiply as I thought.\n\nFirst, \\((a + b)^4\\) is \\(a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6.\n\nThen, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Let me compute that:\n\nThe expansion is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} (1/c)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\).\n\nSo, the terms are:\n\n- m=0: \\(\\dbinom{6}{0}c^{6} = 1 \\times c^6\\)\n- m=1: \\(\\dbinom{6}{1}c^{4} = 6c^4\\)\n- m=2: \\(\\dbinom{6}{2}c^{2} = 15c^2\\)\n- m=3: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}c^{0} = 20\\)\n- m=4: \\(\\dbinom{6}{4}c^{-2} = 15c^{-2}\\)\n- m=5: \\(\\dbinom{6}{5}c^{-4} = 6c^{-4}\\)\n- m=6: \\(\\dbinom{6}{6}c^{-6} = 1c^{-6}\\)\n\nSo, the constant term is indeed 20, as I found earlier.\n\nNow, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But since I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term without any \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), the only way that can happen is if I multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by the constant term 20. All other terms in the second expansion would introduce a \\(c\\) term, which would make the product have \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some \\(k\\), but since we're only looking for \\(a^2b^2\\), those other terms don't contribute. So, the coefficient is 6 times 20, which is 120.\n\nWait, but let me check if there's another way to think about this. Suppose I consider the entire expansion as a product, but since the two parts are independent (one in terms of \\(a, b\\) and the other in terms of \\(c\\)), the coefficients multiply when the terms are multiplied. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first part, and the term \\(c^0\\) comes from the second part, so when multiplied together, they give \\(a^2b^2 \\times c^0 = a^2b^2\\), and the coefficient is the product of their individual coefficients.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So, 6 times 20 is 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120.\n\nWait, but just to be thorough, let me consider if there's any other term in the second expansion that could contribute to \\(a^2b^2\\) when multiplied by a term from the first expansion. But since the second expansion only has powers of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), any term from the second expansion would have to have \\(c^0\\) to not affect the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. So, only the constant term from the second expansion contributes, and all other terms would add or subtract powers of \\(c\\), which we don't want. So, I think I'm confident that 120 is the correct coefficient.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the coefficient is 120. I think that's the answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break down the problem into two parts:\n\n1. **Finding the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\):**\n   Using the binomial theorem, the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is given by:\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4-k} b^k\n   \\]\n   The term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\), so the coefficient is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} = \\frac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\n   \\]\n\n2. **Finding the constant term (coefficient of \\(c^0\\)) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   Using the binomial theorem, the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is given by:\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6-2m}\n   \\]\n   We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, which occurs when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\).

But that doesn't seem right either because when you multiply two expressions, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which would mean that the coefficient isn't just a number. \n\nWait, maybe I'm approaching this wrong. Perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, but perhaps the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is independent of \\(c\\), so the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the sum of the coefficients of all terms in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that seems like a stretch. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm supposed to consider that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, and the rest is just multiplied by terms in \\(c\\), so the coefficient remains 6. But I'm not sure. \n\nWait, let me try to write it out. So, \\((a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. Now, the second part is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Let's expand that as well using the binomial theorem. The expansion would be \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(1/c\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\).\n\nSo, when I multiply these two expansions together, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients from the second expansion. \n\nWait, but the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so maybe it's considering the entire expression as a polynomial in \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\), and the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would make the coefficient a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't seem right because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. \n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that seems like the coefficient is an expression, not a number. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and the rest is just multiplied by other terms, so the coefficient remains 6. But that doesn't seem correct because the entire expression is a product, so each term from the first part is multiplied by each term from the second part. \n\nWait, perhaps the problem is just looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and the second part is irrelevant because it's multiplied by terms involving \\(c\\). But I'm not sure. \n\nWait, maybe I should think of it this way: when you have two expressions multiplied together, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each factor. But in this case, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) only comes from the first factor, and it's multiplied by every term in the second factor. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in the second factor. \n\nWait, but the second factor is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which has terms with different powers of \\(c\\). So, the sum of the coefficients in the second factor would be when \\(c = 1\\), because substituting \\(c = 1\\) gives the sum of the coefficients. Let me check that: \\(\\left(1 + 1/1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of the coefficients in the second part is 64. \n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times 64, which is 384. Wait, does that make sense? Let me verify.\n\nIf I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\), which is the sum of the coefficients. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nWait, but I'm not sure if that's the right approach. Let me think again. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the sum over all possible terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any term from the second expansion. So, the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but if the problem is asking for the coefficient as a number, perhaps they mean the sum of all coefficients, which would be 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is only considering the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and the second part is just a constant factor, so the overall coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion, but that doesn't seem right because the expansion includes terms with \\(c\\). \n\nWait, perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the powers of \\(c\\), so the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't seem to be what the problem is asking for. \n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let's see: the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. Since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are only in the first part, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the entire expansion of the second part. So, the coefficient is 6 * \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would make the coefficient an expression in \\(c\\), not a number. \n\nWait, perhaps the problem is phrased differently. Maybe it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating \\(c\\) as a variable, so the coefficient would be 6 times the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that seems odd because coefficients are usually numerical. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when considering all possible terms, regardless of \\(c\\), so the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients of the second expansion, which is 64, giving 384. \n\nWait, let me try to think of it another way. If I have \\((a + b)^4 = 6a^2b^2 + \\text{other terms}\\), and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = \\text{some expansion}\\). When I multiply them together, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the entire expansion of the second part. But if the problem is asking for the coefficient, perhaps it's considering the entire expansion, so the coefficient is 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). \n\nWait, but that seems like the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because coefficients are typically numerical. So, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. \n\nWait, perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and the second part is just a constant factor, so the overall coefficient is 6. But that doesn't seem right because the second part isn't a constant; it's an expression in \\(c\\). \n\nWait, maybe I should look at the problem differently. Perhaps the question is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, so the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which seems unusual. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, so the coefficient is 6. But that seems too simple. \n\nWait, maybe I should think about the entire expression as a product of two polynomials. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first polynomial, and it's multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times each term in the second polynomial. Therefore, the coefficient is 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 times a polynomial in \\(c\\). \n\nBut the problem is asking for the coefficient, which is typically a number, so maybe I'm missing something. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when considering all possible terms, so the coefficient is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, making it 384. \n\nWait, let me check that. If I substitute \\(c = 1\\) into the second expansion, I get \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\), which is the sum of the coefficients. So, if I multiply 6 by 64, I get 384. So, maybe that's the answer. \n\nBut I'm not entirely sure. Let me try to think again. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But if the problem is asking for the coefficient as a number, perhaps it's considering the sum of all coefficients, which is 64, so 6 times 64 is 384. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and the second part is just a constant factor, so the coefficient remains 6. \n\nWait, but the second part is not a constant; it's an expression in \\(c\\), so each term in the product would have a coefficient that's a multiple of the second expansion. \n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try to write out the product. \n\nThe first part is \\((a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). \n\nThe second part is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15/c^2 + 6/c^4 + 1/c^6\\). \n\nWhen I multiply these two, each term in the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part. So, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is \\(6 \\times \\left(c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15/c^2 + 6/c^4 + 1/c^6\\right)\\). \n\nBut the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so that would be the entire expression \\(6 \\times \\left(c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15/c^2 + 6/c^4 + 1/c^6\\right)\\). \n\nWait, but that's a polynomial in \\(c\\), not a numerical coefficient. So, perhaps the problem is phrased incorrectly, or maybe I'm misunderstanding it. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when considering all terms, regardless of \\(c\\), so the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion. The sum of the coefficients in the second expansion is when \\(c = 1\\), which is 2^6 = 64. So, 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 384. \n\nWait, that makes sense because if I set \\(c = 1\\), the entire expression becomes \\((a + b)^4 \\times 2^6\\), and the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nSo, I think that's the answer. \n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{384}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break down the problem into two parts: expanding \\((a + b)^4\\) and considering the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\n1. **Expanding \\((a + b)^4\\):**\n   Using the binomial theorem, the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is:\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k} b^k\n   \\]\n   We need the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2. This term is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} a^2 b^2 = 6 a^2 b^2\n   \\]\n   So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in this part is 6.\n\n2. **Considering the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   Using the binomial theorem, the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is:\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n   \\]\n   The sum of the coefficients in this expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives:\n   \\[\n   \\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\n   \\]\n\n3. **Combining the results:**\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the product of the coefficient from the first part and the sum of the coefficients from the second part. Therefore, we multiply 6 by 64:\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 64 = 384\n   \\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\boxed{384}\\)."

    "text": " I'm a bit confused because the expression involves two different variables, \\(a, b\\) and \\(c\\), but I think I can handle it by breaking it down into parts.\n\nFirst, I remember that when expanding expressions like \\((a + b)^n\\), we can use the binomial theorem. The binomial theorem says that \\((a + b)^n = \\sum_{k=0}^{n} \\dbinom{n}{k} a^{n - k}b^k\\). So maybe I can apply that here for the \\((a + b)^4\\) part.\n\nThe problem is asking specifically for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So I need to find the term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) that has \\(a^2b^2\\). Let me write that out. \n\nIn the binomial expansion, the general term is \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\\). I need the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) to both be 2. So, \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). That makes sense because \\(4 - 2 = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). So the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\).\n\nCalculating that, \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) is \\(\\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So the coefficient is 6. That part seems straightforward.\n\nNow, the other part of the expression is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I need to figure out how this part affects the coefficient. Wait, but the term we're interested in is \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\). So does this mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)? But that doesn't seem right because the question is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not considering \\(c\\). Maybe I'm misunderstanding.\n\nWait, no, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. The expression is a product of two separate binomial expansions: one in terms of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and another in terms of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). Since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\), and \\(1/c\\) are all different variables, their exponents don't interfere with each other. So when we multiply the two expansions together, the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) will multiply with the terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\).\n\nBut the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So in other words, I need to find all the terms in the product where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2, and then sum up their coefficients, considering all possible powers of \\(c\\) that come along with them.\n\nWait, but that might not be the case. Maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), treating \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) as separate variables, but I'm not sure. Let me read the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\"\n\nHmm, so it's possible that they just want the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), treating the entire \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) part as a single term. But that doesn't make much sense because the expression is a product, so each term in the first expansion will multiply each term in the second expansion. Therefore, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would actually be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire second expansion. But that would mean the coefficient isn't just a single number but a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for a coefficient, which is a number, so maybe I'm misunderstanding.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, considering all possible terms, but only looking at the \\(a^2b^2\\) part, and ignoring the \\(c\\) terms. But that still doesn't make sense because the entire expression is a product of two separate polynomials.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\), and then considering that multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial in \\(c\\), not a single number.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Maybe the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable, but since \\(c\\) isn't involved in \\(a^2b^2\\), the coefficient would just be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't seem right because the problem is asking for a coefficient, which should be a numerical value, not a polynomial.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misinterpreting the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\"\n\nAh, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, but since the other part involves \\(c\\), which isn't present in \\(a^2b^2\\), the coefficient would just be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, which doesn't make sense. So maybe I'm missing something.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning that we're looking for the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2, and the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0. That would make sense because then we can consider the entire product and find the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\), which is 1. So the coefficient would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\).\n\nAh, that seems more plausible. So the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, considering that \\(c\\) must also be raised to the 0 power. So I need to find the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\), which is 1. Therefore, the coefficient would be the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\).\n\nLet me confirm that. So, if we expand \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, as I found earlier. Then, in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is the middle term, which is when the exponents of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) balance out to give \\(c^0\\). \n\nSo, in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(1/c\\right)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be 0, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\).\n\nCalculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\) is \\(\\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). Wait, no, that's not right. Let me calculate that again. \\(6! = 720\\), \\(3! = 6\\), so \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 720 / (6 \\times 6) = 720 / 36 = 20\\). Yes, that's correct.\n\nSo the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire product is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the second part), which is 6 \u00d7 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). So does that mean that I need to consider all possible terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any power of \\(c\\), and sum their coefficients? But that would mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for a coefficient, which should be a single number, so I think I must have made a mistake in interpreting the problem.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is simply to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable, but since \\(c\\) isn't part of \\(a^2b^2\\), the coefficient would just be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient isn't a single number but a polynomial, which doesn't make sense. So maybe the problem is intended to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, ignoring the \\(c\\) terms. But that would mean that the coefficient is 6, but that seems too simple.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, considering that the entire expression is a product, so the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So then the coefficient would be 6 \u00d7 64 = 384. But that seems too large, and I'm not sure if that's the correct approach.\n\nWait, no, that approach would be correct if we were looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by all possible powers of \\(c\\), but the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. But in that case, the coefficient would indeed be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial, not a single number. So I'm confused.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable, but since \\(c\\) isn't involved in \\(a^2b^2\\), the coefficient is just 6, and the rest of the terms involve \\(c\\). But that seems too straightforward, and the problem mentions both \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), so I think the intended interpretation is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, considering that the \\(c\\) terms are separate. But that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial, not a single number.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, and the answer is 6 times the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but the problem is phrased as \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", so maybe it's just 6, and the \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) part is considered as a separate factor. But that doesn't seem right because the product would involve all terms from both expansions.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me try to think differently. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). When we expand this, each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion will be multiplied by every term in the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part (which is 6) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So the coefficient isn't a single number but a polynomial in \\(c\\). However, the problem is asking for the coefficient, which is a number, so perhaps I'm misunderstanding.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable, but since \\(c\\) isn't part of \\(a^2b^2\\), the coefficient is just 6, and the rest of the terms involving \\(c\\) are separate. But that seems too simplistic, and I think the problem is more likely asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\). That would make sense because then we're looking for a specific term in the product.\n\nSo, to clarify, the problem might be asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is the term where \\(a\\) is squared, \\(b\\) is squared, and \\(c\\) is to the zero power. Therefore, I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), and then multiply those two coefficients together.\n\nAs I found earlier, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. Now, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Let's work on that.\n\nUsing the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(1/c\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\).\n\nWe need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be 0, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} c^{0}\\), and the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\).\n\nCalculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). So the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire product is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nWait, but the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). So does that mean that I'm supposed to consider all possible terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present, regardless of the power of \\(c\\)? But that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial, not a single number. So I'm a bit confused now.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable, but since \\(c\\) isn't part of \\(a^2b^2\\), the coefficient is just 6, and the rest of the terms involving \\(c\\) are separate. But that seems too simplistic, and I think the problem is more likely asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), as I thought earlier.\n\nWait, maybe I can think of it this way: when you multiply two polynomials together, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. So the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first polynomial will be multiplied by each term in the second polynomial, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for various exponents \\(k\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would require summing all the coefficients of terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present, regardless of the power of \\(c\\). But that would mean adding up all the coefficients from the second polynomial, which is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\).\n\nWait, but that would mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the sum of the coefficients of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). The sum of the coefficients in a polynomial is found by evaluating the polynomial at \\(c = 1\\). So let's calculate \\(\\left(1 + 1/1\\right)^6 = (2)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 64. So then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 \u00d7 64 = 384.\n\nBut that seems high, and I'm not sure if that's the correct approach. Let me think again. If the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then yes, that would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 \u00d7 64 = 384. But I'm not entirely confident about this approach.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then the answer is 120, as I found earlier. But I need to clarify which interpretation is correct.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is simply to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable, so the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, not a single number, which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a coefficient, which should be a number. Therefore, I think the correct interpretation is that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\), which is 1. Therefore, the coefficient is 6 \u00d7 20 = 120.\n\nSo, to recap, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product is 6 \u00d7 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but the problem didn't specify \\(c^0\\), so I'm not sure. Maybe I should present both interpretations.\n\nFirst interpretation: The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, considering all possible powers of \\(c\\). In this case, it's 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 \u00d7 64 = 384.\n\nSecond interpretation: The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 6 \u00d7 20 = 120.\n\nBut since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), I think the first interpretation is correct, and the answer is 384. However, I'm not entirely sure because the problem might be intended to be interpreted as looking for the term where \\(c\\) is also at power 0. \n\nWait, perhaps I can check by expanding both parts. Let me try to see.\n\nFirst, expand \\((a + b)^4\\). The expansion is \\(a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). So the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6.\n\nNow, expand \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). The expansion is \\(c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15/c^2 + 6/c^4 + 1/c^6\\). So the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20.\n\nTherefore, when we multiply the two expansions, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion will multiply each term in the second expansion, giving terms like \\(6a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(6a^2b^2c^4\\), \\(6a^2b^2c^2\\), \\(6a^2b^2 \\times 20\\), etc. So the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 \u00d7 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but that seems to contradict the earlier interpretation where we only consider the \\(c^0\\) term. So which one is correct?\n\nI think the confusion arises from whether the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\) or specifically when \\(c\\) is at power 0.\n\nIf the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 \u00d7 64 = 384.\n\nHowever, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it's 6 \u00d7 20 = 120.\n\nGiven that the problem is phrased as \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", without mentioning \\(c\\), I think it's more likely that they're asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). Therefore, the answer would be 384.\n\nBut I'm not entirely sure, so let me try to think of another way. Maybe the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable, so the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a single coefficient. Therefore, I think the correct interpretation is that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nWait, but in the expansion, \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So if we consider the product as a polynomial in \\(a, b, c\\), then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be a polynomial in \\(c\\), specifically 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But the problem is asking for a coefficient, which is a number, so perhaps the problem is intended to be interpreted as finding the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable, but since \\(c\\) isn't part of \\(a^2b^2\\), the coefficient is just 6, and the rest of the terms involving \\(c\\) are separate. But that seems too simplistic, and I think the problem is more likely asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), as I thought earlier.\n\nWait, perhaps I can check by considering a simpler example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Let's expand this:\n\n\\((a + b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2\\).\n\n\\((c + 1/c)^1 = c + 1/c\\).\n\nMultiplying them together: \\(a^2c + a^2/c + 2abc + 2ab/c + b^2c + b^2/c\\).\n\nNow, the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) in this product would be \\(c + 1/c\\), because \\(a^2\\) is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\).\n\nBut if the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) in this product, it's \\(c + 1/c\\), not a single number. However, if the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2c^0\\), then it's 1, because in the expansion, \\(a^2\\) is multiplied by \\(1/c\\), which is \\(c^{-1}\\), and by \\(c\\), which is \\(c^1\\). So the term where \\(a^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\) is \\(a^2\\) times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\((c + 1/c)^1\\), which is 0 because there is no \\(c^0\\) term in \\((c + 1/c)^1\\). Wait, that's not correct because \\((c + 1/c)^1\\) is \\(c + 1/c\\), so the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 0. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2c^0\\) is 0.\n\nBut in our original problem, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\((c + 1/c)^6\\) is 20, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is 6 \u00d7 20 = 120.\n\nSo, going back to the simpler example, if the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2c^0\\), it's 0, but if it's to find the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), it's \\(c + 1/c\\).\n\nTherefore, in our original problem, if the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), it's 6 \u00d7 \\((c + 1/c)^6\\), which is a polynomial. If it's to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), it's 120.\n\nGiven that the problem is phrased as \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", without specifying \\(c\\), I think it's more likely that they're asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nWait, but in the simpler example, the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) is a polynomial, so perhaps the answer should be presented as a polynomial. But the problem is asking for a coefficient, which is a number, so I think the intended answer is 120.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable, but since \\(c\\) isn't part of \\(a^2b^2\\), the coefficient is just 6. But that seems too simplistic, and I think the problem is more likely expecting 120.\n\nWait, perhaps I can check by calculating the entire expansion. Let me try to compute the product up to the \\(a^2b^2\\) term.\n\nFirst, \\((a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\).\n\nSecond, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15/c^2 + 6/c^4 + 1/c^6\\).\n\nNow, when we multiply these two, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will multiply each term in the second expansion. So the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the entire second expansion, which is \\(6c^6 + 36c^4 + 90c^2 + 120 + 90/c^2 + 36/c^4 + 6/c^6\\).\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is a polynomial in \\(c\\), specifically \\(6\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But the problem is asking for a coefficient, which is a number, so perhaps the problem is intended to be interpreted as finding the constant term with respect to \\(c\\), i.e., the coefficient of \\(c^0\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is 6 \u00d7 20 = 120.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So the answer is 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break down the problem into two parts using the binomial theorem.\n\n1. **Expanding \\((a + b)^4\\)**:\n   Using the binomial theorem, the general term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is given by:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k} b^k\n   \\]\n   We need the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2.

    "text": " I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but I'll take it slow.\n\nFirst, I remember that when expanding expressions like \\((a + b)^n\\), we can use the binomial theorem. The binomial theorem says that \\((a + b)^n = \\sum_{k=0}^{n} \\dbinom{n}{k} a^{n - k} b^{k}\\). So, maybe I can apply that here.\n\nThe expression I have is a product of two binomials raised to different powers: \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I need the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term from the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\). But wait, the entire expression is multiplied by another binomial expansion. So, does that mean I have to consider both expansions together?\n\nI think the key here is to realize that the terms in \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) are multiplied together. So, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will be part of the product, and since \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) are separate variables, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) won't be affected by the \\(c\\) terms. That makes sense because \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are different variables from \\(c\\), so their coefficients should be independent.\n\nWait, but actually, when you multiply two expressions together, each term from the first expression gets multiplied by each term from the second expression. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Is that right?\n\nLet me think again. If I have \\((a + b)^4\\) times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), then when I expand both, I'll have terms like \\(a^kb^{4 - k}\\) from the first part and terms like \\(c^mc^{6 - m}\\) from the second part, where \\(k\\) and \\(m\\) are integers between 0 and their respective exponents. But since \\(c\\) and \\(a\\), \\(b\\) are separate variables, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\).\n\nWait, no, that's not quite right. Because when you multiply the two expressions, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by every term in the other expansion, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) will be the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nWait, but is that the case? Let me think. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\), and when multiplied by any term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), it will result in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2c^{-k}\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second, and we're interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\).\n\nSo, first, let me find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\). Using the binomial theorem, the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^{k}\\). So, the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) occurs is when \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). So, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\nNow, I need to find the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The sum of all coefficients in a polynomial is found by plugging in 1 for all variables. So, if I substitute \\(c = 1\\), the expression becomes \\(\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = (1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 64.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is the product of 6 and 64, which is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake here. I think another way to approach this is to consider that the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is independent of \\(c\\), so when you multiply by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) will be the same as the coefficient in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of the other term. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), the coefficient is just 6 times 64, which is 384.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of it as the coefficient being 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the other expansion, which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me check if that's correct. Let's see, the product of two polynomials, say P(a, b) and Q(c), the coefficient of a term like a^2b^2 would indeed be the coefficient of a^2b^2 in P(a, b) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in Q(c), because each term in Q(c) is multiplied by a^2b^2.\n\nSo, I think that's right. Therefore, the coefficient is 384.\n\nWait, but let me just make sure I didn't miss anything. Let me go through it again.\n\nFirst, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n\nThen, the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by plugging in \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\).\n\nSo, when we multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times 64, which is 384.\n\nI think that makes sense. So, the final answer should be 384.\n\nWait, but another way to think about it is that the entire product is a polynomial in a, b, c, and 1/c. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be present in the product, and its coefficient will be the product of the coefficients from each part. Since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve c, the coefficient is just 6 times the sum of coefficients in the other part, which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nYeah, I think that's correct. I don't see any mistakes in this reasoning. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 384.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{384}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break the problem into two parts: finding the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and finding the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\n1. **Finding the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\):**\n   Using the binomial theorem, the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is given by:\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k} b^k\n   \\]\n   The term \\(a^2b^2\\) occurs when \\(k = 2\\).

    "text": " I remember that when dealing with expansions, the binomial theorem is really useful. Maybe I can apply that here.\n\nFirst, I think I should handle each part of the expression separately and then multiply the results together. So, the expression is a product of two binomials raised to powers: \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Since the terms inside each binomial are different (one involves \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), the other involves \\(c\\)), I don't think they will interfere with each other when expanding. That makes sense because \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are different variables.\n\nLet me start with the first part: \\((a + b)^4\\). I know the binomial theorem says that \\((x + y)^n = \\sum_{k=0}^{n} \\dbinom{n}{k} x^{n - k} y^k\\). So, applying that here, each term in the expansion will be \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k} b^k\\) for \\(k\\) from 0 to 4.\n\nI'm specifically looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). That means I need the term where \\(a\\) is squared and \\(b\\) is also squared. Let's see, in the expansion, the exponent of \\(a\\) is \\(4 - k\\) and the exponent of \\(b\\) is \\(k\\). So, if I set \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\), that should give me the term with \\(a^2b^2\\).\n\nCalculating the binomial coefficient for that term: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). I remember that \\(\\dbinom{n}{k} = \\dfrac{n!}{k!(n - k)!}\\). Plugging in the numbers: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient from the first part is 6.\n\nOkay, so from \\((a + b)^4\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) has a coefficient of 6. Now, I need to consider the second part of the expression: \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Hmm, this seems a bit trickier because of the \\(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\) term, but I think I can still apply the binomial theorem here.\n\nLet me write it out: \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying the exponents, \\(c^{6 - m} \\times c^{-m} = c^{6 - 2m}\\). So each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\).\n\nWait, but in the original problem, we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). However, this second part involves \\(c\\) terms. Since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are different variables, the product of these two expansions will involve terms like \\(a^k b^{4 - k} c^{6 - 2m}\\) or something similar. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), I think we might need to consider the terms where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero because \\(c^0 = 1\\), which is the only way the \\(c\\) terms won't affect the coefficient we're looking for.\n\nSo, if I can find the term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, then when I multiply it by the corresponding term from \\((a + b)^4\\), I'll get a term that only has \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms, which is what we need.\n\nLet me set the exponent of \\(c\\) to zero: \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(6 = 2m\\), so \\(m = 3\\). So, the term where \\(m = 3\\) in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) will have \\(c^0\\), which is 1. Therefore, the coefficient of this term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\).\n\nCalculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). So, the coefficient from the second part is 20.\n\nNow, putting it all together. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion has a coefficient of 6, and the term \\(c^0\\) from the second expansion has a coefficient of 20. Since these two terms are multiplied together in the overall expression, their coefficients multiply as well. So, 6 times 20 is 120.\n\nWait, let me double-check that. So, the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) gives me 6\\(a^2b^2\\), and the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) gives me 20\\(c^0\\). When I multiply these two together, I get 6 \\times 20 = 120, and the term becomes 120\\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is just 120\\(a^2b^2\\). So, that seems correct.\n\nBut wait, I want to make sure I didn't make a mistake in considering only the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. Let me think: when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), every term in the first expansion will be multiplied by every term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part can be multiplied by any term from the second part, but only the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero will result in a term that has no \\(c\\) in it. All other terms will have some power of \\(c\\), which we don't want because we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not any terms involving \\(c\\).\n\nSo, yes, I think I was correct to only consider the term where \\(m = 3\\) in the second expansion because that's the only one that doesn't introduce any \\(c\\) terms. Therefore, the coefficient is indeed 120.\n\nLet me recap to make sure I didn't miss anything. The problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product of two expansions. For the first expansion, \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. For the second expansion, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term that doesn't involve \\(c\\) (i.e., \\(c^0\\)) has a coefficient of 20. Multiplying these two coefficients together gives 6 * 20 = 120. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120.\n\nI think that makes sense. Let me see if there's another way to approach this problem. Maybe by considering the entire expansion, but that seems more complicated. Alternatively, perhaps using multinomial coefficients, but I think the binomial approach is straightforward here.\n\nWait, another thought: when multiplying two polynomials, the coefficients multiply for the corresponding terms. So, since we're only interested in the term where the variables \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are squared, and \\(c\\) is raised to the zero power, we can treat the two parts separately as I did before. So, I think my method is correct.\n\nJust to be thorough, let me compute both expansions in more detail, at least partially, to see if I can spot any errors.\n\nStarting with \\((a + b)^4\\):\n\nUsing the binomial theorem:\n\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\dbinom{4}{0}a^4b^0 + \\dbinom{4}{1}a^3b^1 + \\dbinom{4}{2}a^2b^2 + \\dbinom{4}{3}a^1b^3 + \\dbinom{4}{4}a^0b^4\n\\]\n\nCalculating each term:\n\n- \\(\\dbinom{4}{0} = 1\\), so first term is \\(a^4\\)\n- \\(\\dbinom{4}{1} = 4\\), so second term is \\(4a^3b\\)\n- \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\), so third term is \\(6a^2b^2\\)\n- \\(\\dbinom{4}{3} = 4\\), so fourth term is \\(4ab^3\\)\n- \\(\\dbinom{4}{4} = 1\\), so fifth term is \\(b^4\\)\n\nSo, the expansion is \\(a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). That confirms that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6.\n\nNow, let's look at the second expansion: \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem:\n\n\\[\n\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n\\]\n\nCalculating each term:\n\n- When \\(m = 0\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{0}c^{6} = 1 \\times c^6\\)\n- When \\(m = 1\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{1}c^{4} = 6 \\times c^4\\)\n- When \\(m = 2\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{2}c^{2} = 15 \\times c^2\\)\n- When \\(m = 3\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}c^{0} = 20 \\times 1\\)\n- When \\(m = 4\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{4}c^{-2} = 15 \\times c^{-2}\\)\n- When \\(m = 5\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{5}c^{-4} = 6 \\times c^{-4}\\)\n- When \\(m = 6\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{6}c^{-6} = 1 \\times c^{-6}\\)\n\nSo, the expansion is \\(c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15c^{-2} + 6c^{-4} + c^{-6}\\). That shows that the constant term (the term with \\(c^0\\)) is indeed 20.\n\nNow, when we multiply the two expansions together, we get:\n\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = (a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4) \\times (c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15c^{-2} + 6c^{-4} + c^{-6})\n\\]\n\nBut we're only interested in the terms where the resulting expression has \\(a^2b^2\\). Since we're multiplying polynomials, each term in the first expansion gets multiplied by each term in the second expansion. However, since we're looking for a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), we need to find the product of the term with \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first polynomial and the constant term (20) from the second polynomial.\n\nSo, the term in question is \\(6a^2b^2 \\times 20 = 120a^2b^2\\). All other terms would involve some power of \\(c\\), which we don't want. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120.\n\nWait, let me just confirm that there's no other way \\(a^2b^2\\) could come up without involving \\(c\\). For example, could there be a term where \\(c\\) cancels out, like \\(c \\times c^{-1}\\), but that would involve \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms as well, right? But no, because each term in the first expansion only has \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and each term in the second expansion only has \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\). So, when you multiply them, the variables are independent. So, the only way to get a term that's purely \\(a^2b^2\\) is to multiply \\(6a^2b^2\\) by the constant term 20. There's no other combination because any other term from the second expansion would introduce a \\(c\\) term, which we don't want.\n\nTherefore, I'm confident that the coefficient is 120.\n\nWait, just to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the binomial coefficients, let me recalculate them.\n\nFor \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Calculating that: 4! = 24, 2! = 2, so 24 / (2 * 2) = 6. That's correct.\n\nFor \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero is when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), so \\(m = 3\\). The coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: 6! = 720, 3! = 6, so 720 / (6 * 6) = 720 / 36 = 20. That's correct too.\n\nMultiplying 6 and 20 gives 120. Yep, that seems right.\n\nI think I've covered all the steps and checked my work. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is 120.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem for each part separately and then combine the results.\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\):**\n   - The general term is \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k} b^k\\).\n   - For \\(a^2b^2\\), set \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\).\n   - The coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n\n2. **Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   - The general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\).\n   - For the term with \\(c^0\\), set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), giving \\(m = 3\\).\n   - The coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n\n3. **Combine the coefficients:**\n   - Multiply the coefficients from both expansions: \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

    "text": " \n\nFirst, I remember that when dealing with expressions like \\((a + b)^n\\), the coefficients of the terms can be found using the binomial theorem. The binomial theorem states that \\((a + b)^n = \\sum_{k=0}^{n} \\dbinom{n}{k} a^{n - k} b^k\\). So, maybe I can apply that here.\n\nThe problem is asking specifically for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). That means I'm looking for the term where \\(a\\) is squared and \\(b\\) is also squared. Let me write down the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem.\n\nSo, \\((a + b)^4 = \\dbinom{4}{0}a^4 + \\dbinom{4}{1}a^3b + \\dbinom{4}{2}a^2b^2 + \\dbinom{4}{3}ab^3 + \\dbinom{4}{4}b^4\\). \n\nLooking at this, the term with \\(a^2b^2\\) is the third term, which is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}a^2b^2\\). I know that \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) is the number of combinations of 4 things taken 2 at a time. Let me calculate that: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\nBut wait, the problem isn't just \\((a + b)^4\\), it's multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I need to consider how this multiplication affects the term \\(a^2b^2\\). \n\nLet me think. When you multiply two expressions together, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by every term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nBut the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which suggests that we're only concerned with the part involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and not with the \\(c\\) terms. So, does that mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)? \n\nWait, no, that doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a specific term in the product. So, actually, when we multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), and so on. \n\nBut the question is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would actually be the sum of all the coefficients from the second expansion, because each term in the second expansion is being multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 (from the first part) multiplied by the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nWait, is that correct? Let me make sure. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) is being multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), so the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) times each term in the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in the second expansion. \n\nBut how do I find the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)? I think the sum of coefficients in a polynomial is found by plugging in 1 for all variables. So, if I substitute \\(c = 1\\) into \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), I should get the sum of the coefficients.\n\nLet me calculate that: \\(\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = (1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 multiplied by 64, which is 384. \n\nWait, that seems high. Let me check my reasoning again. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Perhaps the question is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, when we multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is just multiplied by each term in the second expansion, but since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient would just be 6 times the entire expansion of the second part, but that's not quite right either because each term in the second expansion has a different power of \\(c\\).\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the question. It says, \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\" in the entire product. So, in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term will be of the form \\(a^kb^{4 - k}c^m\\) where \\(k\\) is from 0 to 4 and \\(m\\) is from, I think, -6 to 6, in steps of 2? Because each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) will have exponents that are even numbers, right?\n\nWait, actually, no. Let me think again. Each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is of the form \\(\\dbinom{6}{n}c^{6 - n} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^n = \\dbinom{6}{n}c^{6 - 2n}\\), where \\(n\\) ranges from 0 to 6. So, the exponents on \\(c\\) will be \\(6, 4, 2, 0, -2, -4, -6\\). \n\nSo, when we multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, for the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which has a coefficient of 6, when multiplied by each term in the second expansion, it will create terms like \\(6a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(6a^2b^2c^4\\), \\(6a^2b^2c^2\\), \\(6a^2b^2c^0\\), \\(6a^2b^2c^{-2}\\), \\(6a^2b^2c^{-4}\\), and \\(6a^2b^2c^{-6}\\).\n\nBut the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not considering the \\(c\\) terms. Wait, that can't be right because in the product, each term has both \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) multiplied by some power of \\(c\\). So, actually, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would only appear when multiplied by \\(c^0\\), right? Because if you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by \\(c^k\\), where \\(k\\) is not zero, you get \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), which is a different term. So, perhaps the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is only the coefficient from the first part, multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part.\n\nWait, that makes more sense. Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by \\(c^0\\), you get \\(a^2b^2\\), which is the term we're interested in. If we multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by any other term in the second expansion, it would result in a term that includes \\(c\\) raised to some power, which is not just \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is just 6 multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nOkay, so now I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let's use the binomial theorem again. \n\nThe expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{n=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{n}c^{6 - n} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^n = \\sum_{n=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{n}c^{6 - 2n}\\).\n\nWe need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0. So, set \\(6 - 2n = 0\\). Solving for \\(n\\), we get \\(2n = 6\\), so \\(n = 3\\).\n\nTherefore, the term where \\(c^0\\) occurs is when \\(n = 3\\), and the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\).\n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. \n\nTherefore, going back to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 (from \\((a + b)^4\\)) multiplied by 20 (from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)), which is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nWait, let me double-check that. So, in the first part, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. In the second part, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. When we multiply these two terms together, \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\) gives us \\(a^2b^2\\), and the coefficient is 6 times 20, which is indeed 120.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 120.\n\nI think that makes sense. Let me just recap to make sure I didn't miss anything. \n\n1. I found the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem, which is 6.\n2. I realized that in the entire product, this term would be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but only the term with \\(c^0\\) would result in a term that is just \\(a^2b^2\\).\n3. I used the binomial theorem again on \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\), which is 20.\n4. I multiplied the two coefficients together to get the final coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, which is 120.\n\nI don't think I made any mistakes here, but let me just confirm the binomial coefficients again to be sure.\n\nFor \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Correct.\n\nFor \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term with \\(c^0\\) is when \\(n = 3\\), so the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Correct.\n\nMultiplying 6 and 20 gives 120. Yep, that seems right.\n\nSo, I think I'm confident that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break down the problem into two parts using the binomial theorem.\n\nFirst, we consider the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\). Using the binomial theorem, we have:\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k} b^k\n\\]\nThe term with \\(a^2b^2\\) is given by:\n\\[\n\\dbinom{4}{2}a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\n\\]\nSo, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\nNext, we consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem, we have:\n\\[\n\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{n=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{n}c^{6 - 2n}\n\\]\nWe need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0. Setting \\(6 - 2n = 0\\), we find \\(n = 3\\). The coefficient of this term is:\n\\[\n\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the product of the coefficients from the two expansions:\n\\[\n6 \\times 20 = 120\n\\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}."

    "text": " I'm a bit confused because the expression involves two different variables, \\(a, b\\) and \\(c\\), but the term we're interested in is \\(a^2b^2\\). So maybe the \\(c\\) part doesn't affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)? Or does it? Wait, actually, I think I need to consider both parts because the entire expression is multiplied together. But the term \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), so maybe the coefficient will just be the product of the coefficients from each part. Let me think.\n\nFirst, I'll tackle the \\((a + b)^4\\) part. I remember that when expanding a binomial like \\((a + b)^n\\), the coefficients can be found using the binomial theorem, which involves combinations. The binomial theorem states that \\((a + b)^n = \\sum_{k=0}^{n} \\dbinom{n}{k} a^{n - k}b^{k}\\). So, in this case, \\(n = 4\\), and I need the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2. That would be when \\(k = 2\\) because then \\(a^{4 - 2}b^{2} = a^2b^2\\). \n\nSo, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Let me calculate that. \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). Okay, so the coefficient from the first part is 6.\n\nNow, moving on to the second part: \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I'm supposed to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but this part only involves \\(c\\). Wait, that's confusing. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't have any \\(c\\) in it, so does that mean that when I multiply the two expressions together, the \\(c\\) terms won't affect the \\(a^2b^2\\) term? Or do I need to consider something else?\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Since the term \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would just be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because when you multiply the two expressions, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term would come from multiplying the corresponding terms in each part. So, if I take the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part (which has coefficient 6) and multiply it by the term in the second part that has \\(c^0\\) (i.e., the constant term), then that would give me the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression.\n\nSo, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me figure that out. Again, using the binomial theorem, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\).\n\nWe need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be 0, so we set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Let me calculate that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\).\n\nSo, the coefficient from the second part is 20. Therefore, the overall coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the two coefficients, which is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nWait, but let me double-check. Is the term \\(a^2b^2\\) only affected by the constant term in the second part? Or could there be other terms that somehow contribute to \\(a^2b^2\\) when multiplied? Hmm, no, because \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\) at all, so when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) is to take the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part and multiply it by the constant term from the second part. So, I think my reasoning is correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider the entire expansion, but that seems unnecessary because the other terms involve \\(c\\) and would produce terms with \\(c\\) in them, which we don't want. So, yeah, I think the coefficient is 120.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me think about it another way. If I expand both parts separately and then multiply them, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term would come from multiplying \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part by each term in the second part. But since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a constant with respect to \\(c\\), multiplying it by each term in the second expansion would just distribute the 6 coefficient across all the terms in the second expansion. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term without \\(c\\), we only need the constant term from the second expansion. So, that confirms it again: 6 times 20 is 120.\n\nI think that's solid. So, the coefficient is 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break the problem into two parts.\n\nFirst, consider the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^{k}\n\\]\nWe need the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2, which corresponds to \\(k = 2\\). The coefficient for this term is:\n\\[\n\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\n\\]\n\nNext, consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem:\n\\[\n\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n\\]\nWe need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, which occurs when \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\) gives \\(k = 3\\). The coefficient for this term is:\n\\[\n\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\n\\]\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficients from each part:\n\\[\n6 \\times 20 = 120\n\\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}."

So, I should look at the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) and find the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2.\n\nLet me write out the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\). Using the binomial theorem, each term is \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k} b^{k}\\), where \\(k\\) goes from 0 to 4.\n\nSo, the terms would be:\n\n- When \\(k = 0\\): \\(\\dbinom{4}{0} a^4 b^0 = 1 \\cdot a^4\\)\n- When \\(k = 1\\): \\(\\dbinom{4}{1} a^3 b^1 = 4 \\cdot a^3 b\\)\n- When \\(k = 2\\): \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} a^2 b^2 = 6 \\cdot a^2 b^2\\)\n- When \\(k = 3\\): \\(\\dbinom{4}{3} a^1 b^3 = 4 \\cdot a b^3\\)\n- When \\(k = 4\\): \\(\\dbinom{4}{4} a^0 b^4 = 1 \\cdot b^4\\)\n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. Okay, that part seems clear.\n\nNow, the original problem is \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, this is the product of two expressions. I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product. Wait, but the second part involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), which don't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\). So, does that mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just the same as in \\((a + b)^4\\), multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\n\nWait, no, that doesn't seem right. Because when you multiply two expressions, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by every term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, does that mean that the coefficient is just 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)? But that can't be, because then the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\), not a single number.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" Hmm, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient when considering all variables together, but only the term where \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are squared, regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). But since \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) are separate variables, maybe the coefficient is just 6 times the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but I'm not sure.\n\nWait, no, that doesn't make sense. Let me think differently. Maybe the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, which would mean that we're treating \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) as separate variables, but the term \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), so when we multiply, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't seem right either because the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, each of which has a different power of \\(c\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually have multiple terms with different powers of \\(c\\), each multiplied by 6. So, perhaps the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so maybe it's just 6 times the entire expansion, but I'm not sure if that's the case.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try a different approach. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so perhaps it's only considering the part of the product that involves \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and not the \\(c\\) terms. So, maybe the coefficient is just 6, because the \\(c\\) terms are separate and don't affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). But that seems too simple.\n\nWait, no, that can't be right because when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by every term in the second part, which includes various powers of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would actually be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but that doesn't seem right because the problem is asking for a coefficient, not an expression involving \\(c\\).\n\nWait, maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some specific \\(k\\), but the problem as stated just says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", without mentioning \\(c\\). So, perhaps the problem is assuming that we're only considering terms where \\(c\\) is present, but that doesn't make much sense because \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\).\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is considering all possible terms in the product, and it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). In that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), because each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) contributes a coefficient when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). But that seems a bit off because the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), so \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). So, would the coefficient be 6 * 64 = 384? Hmm, but that seems high.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so perhaps it's considering the entire product as a single polynomial, and we're looking for the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) appears, regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), because each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) will multiply \\(a^2b^2\\), giving terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for various \\(k\\), but the coefficient for each of these would be 6 times the corresponding coefficient from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But if we're just looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\), then maybe we need to sum all those coefficients, which would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\).\n\nWait, but the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is found by substituting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 * 64 = 384. But that seems like a lot. Let me check that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, without considering the \\(c\\) terms, which would mean that the coefficient is just 6, as in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\), because the other part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. But that doesn't seem right because when you multiply, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second, so the coefficient would actually be 6 times the entire expansion of the second part.\n\nWait, maybe I'm mixing up how coefficients work. Let me think again. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the sum of all products where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any term from the second expansion. So, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384. But I'm not sure if that's correct.\n\nWait, another approach: maybe the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would appear in the product as \\(a^2b^2 \\times\\) each term from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), meaning that the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for a coefficient, which is usually a number, not an expression. So, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, without considering \\(c\\). That is, maybe the problem is treating \\(c\\) as a constant, so the coefficient would be 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but that would make the coefficient a polynomial in \\(c\\), which seems odd.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is considering the entire expression as a polynomial in \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\), and \\(1/c\\), and it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). In that case, the coefficient would indeed be 6 times the sum of all coefficients from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me check that. If I expand \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the sum of the coefficients is when \\(c = 1\\), which gives 2^6 = 64. So, if I multiply that by 6, I get 384. But is that the correct approach?\n\nWait, no, I think I'm confusing the sum of coefficients with the expansion. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would actually be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), because each term in the second expansion is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient is 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which would be a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient, so perhaps it's expecting a numerical value, which would mean that I'm supposed to evaluate \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) at a specific value of \\(c\\), but that's not indicated in the problem.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try to approach it differently. The problem is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\) with coefficient 6, and when we multiply by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is a term in \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), meaning that the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient, so perhaps it's expecting just the numerical coefficient without considering \\(c\\), which would be the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 64, as I thought before. So, 6 * 64 = 384. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 384.\n\nWait, but let me confirm this. If I consider \\((a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^6 \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\), because each term is \\(c^{6 - k} \\times (1/c)^k = c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), resulting in \\(6a^2b^2 \\times \\left(c^{6} + 6c^{4} + 15c^{2} + 20 + 15c^{-2} + 6c^{-4} + c^{-6}\\right)\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is \\(6 \\times \\left(c^{6} + 6c^{4} + 15c^{2} + 20 + 15c^{-2} + 6c^{-4} + c^{-6}\\right)\\). So, the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), but if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), then maybe it's just 6 times the entire expression, but that seems odd.\n\nWait, but perhaps the problem is only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and since \\(c\\) is another variable, the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem didn't specify any particular power of \\(c\\), so maybe it's expecting the entire coefficient as a polynomial. But that doesn't seem right because the problem is asking for the coefficient, not the entire term.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try to think differently. The problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. Since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which would be a polynomial in \\(c\\). So, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times \\left(c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15c^{-2} + 6c^{-4} + c^{-6}\\right)\\). But that's a bit long, and the problem is probably expecting a numerical value. So, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where the exponents of \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are 2, 2, and 0 respectively. But the problem didn't specify that, so I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable, so the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that seems like a lot, and I'm not sure if that's what the problem is asking for.\n\nWait, let me try to think of it as two separate problems. First, find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, as I found earlier. Then, the other part is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, when you multiply these two, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which is \\(6(c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15c^{-2} + 6c^{-4} + c^{-6})\\). But since the problem is asking for the coefficient, not the term, maybe it's just 6 multiplied by the expansion, but that seems unclear.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try to look for another approach. Perhaps the problem is actually to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion of the entire product, considering all variables. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) can only come from the product of the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in \\((a + b)^4\\) and any term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 384.\n\nWait, but let me check that again. If I consider that the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 64, then 6 * 64 = 384. So, that would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. But I'm not entirely sure if that's the correct approach.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable, which would mean that the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But since the problem is asking for a coefficient, I think it's more likely that it's expecting a numerical value, so 384 would be the answer.\n\nWait, but let me make sure. Let me consider that when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each polynomial. But in this case, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from \\((a + b)^4\\), and it's multiplied by every term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But if we're just looking for the coefficient, without considering \\(c\\), then it's 6 times the sum of the coefficients of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nI think that's the answer.

So, I think I can apply the binomial theorem here. Let me write that out. The expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) would be:\n\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\dbinom{4}{0}a^4b^0 + \\dbinom{4}{1}a^3b^1 + \\dbinom{4}{2}a^2b^2 + \\dbinom{4}{3}a^1b^3 + \\dbinom{4}{4}a^0b^4\n\\]\n\nSimplifying each term, that becomes:\n\n\\[\n1 \\cdot a^4 + 4 \\cdot a^3b + 6 \\cdot a^2b^2 + 4 \\cdot ab^3 + 1 \\cdot b^4\n\\]\n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in this expansion is 6. Okay, that seems straightforward. But wait, the original problem isn't just \\((a + b)^4\\), it's multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Hmm, so I need to consider both expansions and how they interact.\n\nI think the key here is that the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\), and the other part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), will contribute some multiple when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). But wait, actually, when you multiply two expressions together, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression. So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I need to see if there are any terms in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) that would affect the \\(a^2b^2\\) term when multiplied.\n\nWait, but \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are different variables from \\(c\\), so when I multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by any term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the variables won't interfere with each other. That means the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression will just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't seem right because the question is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\) at all. So maybe I'm overcomplicating it.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of what happens with \\(c\\). So, maybe I just need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and then, since the other part is multiplied by it, the coefficient would be that same value times whatever comes from the other expansion. But no, actually, when you multiply two expressions, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. But in this case, since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will be multiplied by every term in the second expansion. But the question is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\). So, actually, the coefficient would just be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all the coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because when you multiply, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in the second expression.\n\nWait, but that doesn't sound right either. Let me think again. Maybe I'm confusing the variables. Since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would mean that any term involving \\(c\\) would be part of a different term in the product. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would just be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that can't be, because then the coefficient would be a sum, not a single value. Hmm, I'm getting confused.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me try to rephrase. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product of \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are different variables, the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are independent of those involving \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't make sense because the coefficient should be a number, not an expression involving \\(c\\).\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\), which is 1. That would make sense because then we're looking for the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by the constant term from the other expansion.\n\nSo, let me check that. If that's the case, then I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), and then multiply those two coefficients together to get the final coefficient for \\(a^2b^2c^0\\).\n\nOkay, that makes more sense. So, first, let's find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\). As I did earlier, using the binomial theorem, the expansion is:\n\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\n\\]\n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6.\n\nNext, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me think about how to expand this. Using the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) can be expanded as:\n\n\\[\n\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k - k} = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n\\]\n\nSo, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). I need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so I set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\).\n\nSolving for \\(k\\):\n\n\\[\n6 - 2k = 0 \\\\\n2k = 6 \\\\\nk = 3\n\\]\n\nSo, the term where \\(k = 3\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} c^{0}\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20.\n\nNow, since the original expression is the product of \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) (which is the same as \\(a^2b^2\\)) is the product of the two coefficients I found: 6 and 20.\n\nSo, 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. When you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, in this case, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would come from multiplying \\(6a^2b^2\\) by the constant term \\(20\\) from the second expansion. All other terms would have additional variables, so they wouldn't contribute to the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. Therefore, the coefficient is indeed 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. Suppose I didn't consider the \\(c\\) terms, would that affect the coefficient? No, because \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables, so the only way \\(a^2b^2\\) can appear in the product is if it's multiplied by a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), which is the constant term. So, yes, I think 120 is the correct coefficient.\n\nAlternatively, if I were to think of the entire expansion, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by every term in the second expansion, but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, that would mean we're summing over all possible \\(c\\) terms, which would actually be incorrect because each multiplication would introduce \\(c\\) terms. Wait, no, actually, if we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) irrespective of the \\(c\\) terms, that would be incorrect because each multiplication by a term in the second expansion would attach a \\(c\\) term, so the only way to have \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms is to multiply by the constant term. Therefore, the coefficient is indeed 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but maybe I'm overcomplicating again. Let me try to write it out more formally.\n\nThe original expression is:\n\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\n\\]\n\nWe can expand each part separately:\n\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^4 \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k} b^k\n\\]\n\\[\n\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^6 \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^6 \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n\\]\n\nNow, when we multiply these two expansions together, each term in the first sum is multiplied by each term in the second sum. So, the general term is:\n\n\\[\n\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k} b^k \\times \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n\\]\n\nWe are interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, in the first sum, we need \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). So, \\(k = 2\\), and the coefficient from the first sum is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n\nNow, in the second sum, we need the term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), which is when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), so \\(m = 3\\), and the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nWait, that seems consistent with what I thought earlier. So, the coefficient is 120.\n\nBut just to make sure, let me think if there's another way to approach this. Maybe considering generating functions or something else, but I think the way I did it is correct. I considered each expansion separately, found the necessary coefficients, and then multiplied them together because the variables are independent.\n\nSo, yeah, I think the coefficient is 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break it down into two parts: expanding \\((a + b)^4\\) and finding the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in that expansion, and then finding the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\n1. **Expanding \\((a + b)^4\\):**\n   Using the binomial theorem, the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is:\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k} b^k\n   \\]\n   The term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\), so the coefficient is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\n   \\]\n\n2. **Expanding \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   Using the binomial theorem, the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is:\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n   \\]\n   The term \\(c^0\\) corresponds to \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which gives \\(m = 3\\). The coefficient is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\n   \\]\n\n3. **Combining the coefficients:**\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is the product of the coefficients found above:\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 20 = 120\n   \\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

    "text": " I'm a bit confused, but I'll take it slowly.\n\nFirst, I know that when expanding expressions like \\((a + b)^n\\), we can use the binomial theorem. The binomial theorem says that \\((a + b)^n = \\sum_{k=0}^{n} \\dbinom{n}{k} a^{n - k}b^k\\). So, maybe I can apply that here.\n\nThe problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). That means I need to find the term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2. Let me write that down.\n\nSo, for \\((a + b)^4\\), the general term is \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\\). I need the term where \\(a^2b^2\\), which would mean that \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). So, substituting \\(k = 2\\) into the binomial coefficient, we get \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\).\n\nCalculating that, \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) for \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. That part seems straightforward.\n\nNow, the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Hmm, so does this affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)? I think it does because when we multiply two expressions, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression. But wait, in this case, the second expression only involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), while the first expression involves \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). So, maybe the coefficients are separate? Let me think.\n\nWait, actually, no. Because the two expressions are being multiplied together, the terms from each will combine. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term from the second part, which is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), maybe the \\(c\\) terms don't matter? Or do they?\n\nWait, no, that's not right. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a single coefficient, not an expression.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" Hmm, so it's the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times whatever the \\(c\\) terms are. But the problem just says the coefficient, so maybe it's considering all the \\(c\\) terms together, meaning that the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems too broad because the coefficient would then be a polynomial in \\(c\\), not a single number.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, so the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would have a coefficient that is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But that doesn't seem right either because usually, when someone asks for a coefficient in such a product, they might be considering the entire expression, but maybe I'm overcomplicating.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm supposed to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the powers of \\(c\\), meaning that it's 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), so the coefficient would be 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems odd because the coefficient is usually a number, not an expression. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable, so the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all terms in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't make sense either because the coefficient would then include terms with different powers of \\(c\\).\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misinterpreting the problem. Maybe it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, treating \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) as separate variables. But in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which would include terms like \\(c^6\\), \\(6c^4\\), etc. But that doesn't seem right because the problem is probably expecting a numerical coefficient.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try a different approach. Perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, but considering all possible terms, so the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that also doesn't seem right because the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) would be found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, 6 times 64 would be 384. But I'm not sure if that's the case.\n\nWait, no, that approach might not be correct. Let me think again. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, each term in the expansion would be of the form \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}a^2b^2\\) multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would actually be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient would be 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial in \\(c\\).\n\nBut the problem is asking for a coefficient, which is typically a number, not an expression. Hmm, maybe I'm missing something here. Let me check the problem again: it says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, perhaps it's considering all the terms, and the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), but maybe the problem is expecting just the numerical coefficient, ignoring the \\(c\\) terms. But that doesn't seem right either.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is actually a misstatement, and it's supposed to be in the product, but maybe it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2 each and \\(c\\) is 0. But that seems a bit of a stretch.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, so the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\). But I'm not sure if that's what is intended.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by \\(c^0\\), so the constant term in \\(c\\). That is, the term where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out. So, in that case, I would need to find the term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, which is the middle term, and then multiply that by the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6.\n\nLet me explore this idea. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) can be written using the binomial theorem as \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, the exponent of \\(c\\) in each term is \\(6 - 2k\\). To find the term where the exponent is 0, we set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\).\n\nSo, the term where \\(k = 3\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} c^{0} = 20\\). Therefore, the coefficient from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) for the term with \\(c^0\\) is 20.\n\nNow, since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, and the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the term \\(c^0\\) from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20, then the combined coefficient would be 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, that makes sense. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6, and the term with \\(c^0\\) in the second part is 20, so when you multiply them together, you get 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120.\n\nBut let me double-check to make sure I didn't make a mistake. So, the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) gives \\(a^2b^2\\) with coefficient 6. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) gives the constant term (i.e., \\(c^0\\)) as 20. Multiplying these together, 6 * 20 = 120. So, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem was asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some \\(k\\), then the coefficient would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^k\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But since the problem didn't specify a particular power of \\(c\\), maybe it's just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), which would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but that seems unlikely.\n\nWait, but in the problem statement, it's written as \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when we expand this product, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. Therefore, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by every term from the second part, which includes all powers of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would actually be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which would be a polynomial in \\(c\\).\n\nBut that seems odd because the problem is asking for a coefficient, which is usually a number. So, perhaps I'm misinterpreting the problem. Maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but treating \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) as separate variables. So, in that case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which would be a polynomial in \\(c\\). But that doesn't seem right because the problem is probably expecting a numerical coefficient.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try to think differently. Perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are squared and \\(c\\) is to the zero power. In that case, as I calculated earlier, the coefficient would be 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which would be a polynomial. But that seems unlikely because the problem is probably expecting a single number.\n\nWait, maybe I should look at the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, perhaps it's considering all possible terms, and the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, 6 * 64 = 384. But that seems too high, and I'm not sure if that's the correct approach.\n\nWait, no, that approach is incorrect because the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) isn't the same as the sum of the absolute values of the coefficients. Instead, when \\(c = 1\\), it gives the sum of the coefficients, which is 64. But in our case, we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), so it's 6 times 64, which is 384. But I'm not sure if that's what the problem is asking.\n\nWait, but if I think about it, when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in one polynomial is multiplied by all terms in the other polynomial. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would indeed be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which would be a polynomial. So, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), then it's 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial, not a single number.\n\nBut that doesn't seem right because the problem is probably expecting a numerical coefficient. So, perhaps I'm missing something here. Maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, but considering that the entire expression is a product, and we need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by any power of \\(c\\), which would just be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that's a polynomial, not a single number.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be 6 times the constant term of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 20, so 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nI think that makes more sense because the problem is likely expecting a numerical coefficient, so it's asking for the term where \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are squared and \\(c\\) is to the zero power, meaning the constant term in \\(c\\). So, the coefficient would be 120.\n\nLet me confirm this by expanding \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem, as I did before, the term where \\(k = 3\\) gives the constant term, which is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, that term is 20. Then, multiplying by the 6 from \\((a + b)^4\\), we get 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in interpreting the problem. The problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\)\". So, if I think of the entire product, each term is a product of a term from \\((a + b)^4\\) and a term from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) can be combined with any term from the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would indeed be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial in \\(c\\).\n\nBut if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then it's 6 times the entire expansion, which is a polynomial. However, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it's 6 times 20, which is 120.\n\nI think the problem is more likely asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), so the answer is 120. But just to be thorough, let me check both interpretations.\n\nFirst interpretation: The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\). So, it's 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial. But since the problem is asking for a coefficient, not a polynomial, this might not be the intended interpretation.\n\nSecond interpretation: The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. This seems more plausible because it results in a numerical coefficient.\n\nTherefore, I think the correct answer is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6. Then, considering the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term with \\(c^0\\) (the constant term) is 20. Multiplying these together gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}."

    "text": " \n\nFirst, I remember that when you have an expression like \\((a + b)^n\\), you can expand it using the binomial theorem. The binomial theorem says that \\((a + b)^n = \\sum_{k=0}^{n} \\dbinom{n}{k} a^{n - k} b^k\\). So, maybe I can apply that here.\n\nThe problem is asking specifically about the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). That means I need to find the term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) where the powers of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2. Let me write out the expansion for \\((a + b)^4\\).\n\nUsing the binomial theorem, each term in the expansion will be of the form \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k} b^k\\) where \\(k\\) ranges from 0 to 4. So, when \\(k = 2\\), the term will be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} a^{2} b^{2}\\). Let me calculate that binomial coefficient.\n\n\\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) is equal to \\(\\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\nWait a second, but the original expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I think I need to consider both parts of the product when finding the coefficient. Hmm, but the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), right? So, does that mean I don't need to worry about the other terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\)?\n\nI think so because \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), so when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the terms involving \\(c\\) will multiply with each term in \\((a + b)^4\\), but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't have \\(c\\) in it, I guess we can treat the two parts separately.\n\nWait, actually, no. Because when you multiply two expressions, each term in the first expression is multiplied by each term in the second expression. But since we're looking for a term that only has \\(a^2b^2\\), that means we need to find all possible ways that multiplying a term from \\((a + b)^4\\) with a term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) results in a term that has \\(a^2b^2\\) and no \\(c\\) terms. \n\nBut that doesn't seem right because \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) will have terms with various powers of \\(c\\), but \\(a^2b^2\\) is just a term without \\(c\\). So, maybe I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) and then multiply it by the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\).\n\nWait, that makes sense. Because when you multiply the two expansions together, the terms will combine, and the only way to get a term without \\(c\\) (i.e., \\(c^0\\)) is to multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from \\((a + b)^4\\) by the \\(c^0\\) term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nSo, I think the overall coefficient will be the product of the two individual coefficients: the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nLet me verify that. So, if I denote:\n\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\sum_{i=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{i} a^{4 - i} b^{i}\n\\]\nand\n\\[\n\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{j=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{j} c^{6 - j} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^j = \\sum_{j=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{j} c^{6 - 2j}\n\\]\n\nSo, when we multiply these two expansions together, each term is \\(\\dbinom{4}{i} \\dbinom{6}{j} a^{4 - i} b^{i} c^{6 - 2j}\\). \n\nWe are looking for the coefficient where \\(a^{4 - i} = a^2\\) and \\(b^{i} = b^2\\). That means \\(4 - i = 2\\) so \\(i = 2\\), and \\(i = 2\\) for \\(b^2\\), which checks out. \n\nAdditionally, we want the term where \\(c^{6 - 2j} = c^0\\), so \\(6 - 2j = 0\\), which gives \\(j = 3\\). \n\nTherefore, the coefficient we're looking for is the product of \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) and \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\).\n\nI already calculated \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Now, let me compute \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). \n\n\\[\n\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\n\\]\n\nSo, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nWait, but let me think again. Is this correct? Because when we multiply the two polynomials, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the term where \\(i = 2\\) in the first expansion and \\(j = 3\\) in the second expansion, right? Because \\(6 - 2j = 0\\) implies \\(j = 3\\). \n\nSo, yes, the coefficient is indeed the product of the two binomial coefficients: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} \\times \\dbinom{6}{3} = 6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nWait, but just to make sure I didn't make any mistakes, let me go through it again.\n\nFirst, \\((a + b)^4\\) expansion: the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, correct.\n\nSecond, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) expansion: the term with \\(c^0\\) is when the exponent is zero, so \\(6 - 2j = 0\\), so \\(j = 3\\), and the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\), correct.\n\nMultiplying them together: 6 * 20 = 120, so the coefficient is 120.\n\nWait, but let me check if there's another way to think about this. Maybe using multinomial coefficients or something else?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can consider the entire expression as a product and think about how \\(a^2b^2\\) can be formed. Since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term from \\((a + b)^4\\), and the other part is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), so when we multiply, the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) is by taking the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part and multiplying it by the constant term (i.e., \\(c^0\\)) from the second part.\n\nSo, yes, that seems correct. Therefore, the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't miss any other terms. For instance, could there be a case where a term from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) that isn't \\(c^0\\) could combine with a term from \\((a + b)^4\\) to give \\(a^2b^2\\)? But no, because \\(a^2b^2\\) is independent of \\(c\\), so the only way to get it is to multiply it by \\(c^0\\). So, I think my reasoning is correct.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the coefficient is 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break down the problem into two parts using the binomial theorem.\n\nFirst, consider the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\). Using the binomial theorem, each term is of the form \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k} b^k\\). The term with \\(a^2b^2\\) occurs when \\(k = 2\\), giving us:\n\n\\[\n\\dbinom{4}{2} a^2 b^2 = 6 a^2 b^2\n\\]\n\nNext, consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem, each term is of the form \\(\\dbinom{6}{j} c^{6 - j} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^j = \\dbinom{6}{j} c^{6 - 2j}\\). The term with \\(c^0\\) occurs when \\(6 - 2j = 0\\), which gives \\(j = 3\\). The coefficient for this term is:\n\n\\[\n\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\n\\]\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, we multiply the coefficients from each part:\n\n\\[\n6 \\times 20 = 120\n\\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

So, the coefficient from the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), is 6.\n\nNow, the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the next part is to figure out how this affects the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, but I'm only asked about the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, does the \\(c\\) part affect this? Hmm.\n\nLet me think. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\), and when we multiply by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the expansion of the first part will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of the second part. But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I don't need to worry about the \\(c\\) terms, right? Because \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\). So, the \\(c\\) part doesn't affect the power of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), it just adds more terms with \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\).\n\nWait, but that might not be correct. Let me make sure. The entire expression is the product of two binomial expansions. So, each term from the first expansion is multiplied by each term from the second expansion. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), we can consider the coefficient as the product of the coefficient from the first expansion and the sum of all the coefficients from the second expansion, but only those that result in the term \\(a^2b^2\\) when multiplied.\n\nWait, no, that doesn't make sense. Because when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by every term in the second part. But since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term without \\(c\\), the only way it can combine with terms in the second expansion to still have \\(a^2b^2\\) is if it's multiplied by a term that is 1, because otherwise, the term would have a \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\) component, which would make it something like \\(a^2b^2c\\) or \\(a^2b^2/c\\), which are different from \\(a^2b^2\\).\n\nWait, so does that mean that the only way \\(a^2b^2\\) can appear in the product is if it's multiplied by the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\)? Because if it's multiplied by \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), the resulting term would have a power of \\(c\\) which we don't want. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Because \\(c^0 = 1\\), so that's the constant term.\n\nOkay, that makes sense. So, I need to find two things:\n\n1. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which I already found as 6.\n\n2. The coefficient of \\(c^0\\) (the constant term) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\).\n\nThen, the final coefficient would be the product of these two, right?\n\nSo, let me work on finding the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Again, I can use the binomial theorem here. The expansion is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(1/c\\right)^k\\).\n\nSimplifying each term, that's \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} c^{-k}\\) which is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\).\n\nWe want the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so we set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\):\n\n\\(6 - 2k = 0\\)\n\n\\(2k = 6\\)\n\n\\(k = 3\\)\n\nSo, the constant term is when \\(k = 3\\). The coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\).\n\nCalculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the second part). So, 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, let me double-check that. So, the first part gives 6, the second part gives 20, so the product is 120. That seems right.\n\nBut just to make sure, let me think again. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\) as 6a\u00b2b\u00b2. Then, when we multiply by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second. So, 6a\u00b2b\u00b2 is multiplied by every term in the second expansion, including the constant term 20. So, the term 6a\u00b2b\u00b2 * 20 is 120a\u00b2b\u00b2, which is what we're looking for. The other terms would have powers of \\(c\\), which we don't care about because we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\).\n\nWait, but hold on a second. Is there another way that \\(a^2b^2\\) could appear? Like, if in the second expansion, we have a term that's \\(c^k\\) and in the first expansion, we have another term that's multiplied by \\(c^{-k}\\), but that would require \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms to be different. But no, because in the first expansion, all the terms are just \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), so when multiplied by any term in the second expansion that isn't \\(c^0\\), the resulting term would have a \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\) component, making it something like \\(a^2b^2c\\) or \\(a^2b^2/c\\), which are different from \\(a^2b^2\\). So, only the constant term from the second expansion would contribute to the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the product.\n\nSo, I think I'm confident that the coefficient is 120.\n\nWait, let me just make sure I didn't make any calculation errors. So, \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) is indeed 6, because 4 choose 2 is 6. And \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\) is 20, because 6 choose 3 is 20. So, 6 * 20 is 120. Yep, that seems correct.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is 120. So, I think that's the answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break the problem down into two parts using the binomial theorem.\n\nFirst, consider the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\). Using the binomial theorem, the general term is given by:\n\\[\n\\binom{4}{k} a^{4 - k} b^k\n\\]\nWe need the term where the powers of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2. This occurs when \\(k = 2\\), so the term is:\n\\[\n\\binom{4}{2} a^2 b^2 = 6 a^2 b^2\n\\]\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\nNext, consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem, the general term is given by:\n\\[\n\\binom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\binom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n\\]\nWe need the constant term, which occurs when the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0. This happens when:\n\\[\n6 - 2k = 0 \\implies k = 3\n\\]\nThe constant term is:\n\\[\n\\binom{6}{3} = 20\n\\]\n\nFinally, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficients from the two expansions:\n\\[\n6 \\times 20 = 120\n\\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

Since the problem is asking about the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I can probably focus just on the first part because the second part involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), which don't have any relation to \\(a\\) or \\(b\\). So, maybe the second expansion doesn't affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, is that right?\n\nLet me think. The entire expression is a product of two binomials, so when I expand them, each term from the first expansion will multiply each term from the second expansion. But since I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I can consider the terms from the first expansion that give \\(a^2b^2\\) and then multiply them by any terms from the second expansion. But since the second expansion doesn't have any \\(a\\) or \\(b\\) terms, those terms will just be constants with respect to \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). So, maybe I can just find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion and then multiply it by the entire second expansion, but since I only care about the coefficient, perhaps I can just take the coefficient from the first part and ignore the second part because it doesn't contribute to the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. Hmm, that seems a bit confusing. Let me try to clarify.\n\nSo, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When I expand this, each term will be of the form \\(\\binom{4}{k}a^{k}b^{4 - k}\\) multiplied by \\(\\binom{6}{m}c^{m}\\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^{6 - m}\\). Simplifying that, the term becomes \\(\\binom{4}{k}\\binom{6}{m} a^{k}b^{4 - k} c^{m - (6 - m)}\\), which simplifies further to \\(\\binom{4}{k}\\binom{6}{m} a^{k}b^{4 - k} c^{2m - 6}\\).\n\nBut I'm only interested in the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2 each, so \\(a^2b^2\\). That means \\(k = 2\\) because \\(a\\) is raised to the \\(k\\)th power and \\(b\\) is raised to \\(4 - k\\). So, if \\(k = 2\\), then \\(4 - k = 2\\), which gives me \\(a^2b^2\\). So, I need to find the coefficient for \\(k = 2\\) in the first expansion, which is \\(\\binom{4}{2}\\), and then consider how the second expansion affects this term.\n\nWait, but the second expansion is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Each term in this expansion is \\(\\binom{6}{m}c^{m}\\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^{6 - m}\\), which simplifies to \\(\\binom{6}{m}c^{2m - 6}\\). So, each term from the second expansion has a power of \\(c\\), but since I'm only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), I think I need to consider the entire second expansion as a single factor that multiplies the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. But wait, no, because each term in the second expansion is a different power of \\(c\\), so when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the product will have a specific combination of \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) terms.\n\nBut since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), I think I might need to sum over all possible terms that have \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by any power of \\(c\\). Wait, but that doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would typically be a term without any \\(c\\) terms. Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating this.\n\nLet me try another approach. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When expanding this, each term in the product will be a term from the first expansion multiplied by a term from the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first expansion, and it will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion multiplied by the entire second expansion. But that can't be right because the second expansion isn't a single term; it's multiple terms with different powers of \\(c\\). So, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would be the coefficient from the first expansion, \\(\\binom{4}{2}\\), multiplied by the entire second expansion. But that would mean the coefficient is \\(\\binom{4}{2} \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial in \\(c\\), not a constant. But the problem is asking for a coefficient, which is a number, so maybe I'm missing something.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where the exponents of \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are 2, 2, and 0, respectively. That would make sense because then the coefficient would be a constant. Alternatively, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), but that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because coefficients are usually constants. So, perhaps the problem is miswritten, or maybe I'm misinterpreting it.\n\nWait, let me read the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, it's possible that the problem is only considering the terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) appears, regardless of the power of \\(c\\), but in that case, the coefficient would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems a bit odd because the coefficient would then be a sum of terms involving different powers of \\(c\\). Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be a specific term where \\(c\\) is raised to the zero power, effectively being 1. That seems more plausible because then the coefficient would be a constant.\n\nSo, perhaps I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product. Let me assume that's the case. So, to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), I need to consider the product of terms from \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) that result in \\(a^2b^2c^0\\).\n\nFirst, let's find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\). Using the binomial theorem, the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\binom{4}{k} a^k b^{4 - k}\\). So, the term where \\(k = 2\\) is \\(\\binom{4}{2} a^2 b^2\\), which is \\(6a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient is 6.\n\nNext, I need to consider the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I need to find the term in this expansion that has \\(c^0\\), because when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), it will give me \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). So, let's find the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0.\n\nThe general term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\binom{6}{m} c^m \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^{6 - m} = \\binom{6}{m} c^{m - (6 - m)} = \\binom{6}{m} c^{2m - 6}\\).\n\nWe want the exponent of \\(c\\) to be 0, so we set \\(2m - 6 = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the term where \\(m = 3\\) is \\(\\binom{6}{3} c^{0} = 20 \\times 1 = 20\\).\n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion is 20.\n\nNow, since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product, we multiply the coefficients from both expansions. So, the coefficient from the first part is 6, and the coefficient from the second part is 20. Therefore, the total coefficient is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nWait, let me double-check that. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion has a coefficient of 6, and the term \\(c^0\\) from the second expansion has a coefficient of 20. When we multiply these two terms together, the coefficient becomes 6 * 20 = 120, and the variables are \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is just \\(a^2b^2\\). So, that seems correct.\n\nBut wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in calculating the binomial coefficients. For the first part, \\(\\binom{4}{2}\\) is indeed 6 because 4! / (2! * 2!) = (24)/(2 * 2) = 6. For the second part, \\(\\binom{6}{3}\\) is 20 because 6! / (3! * 3!) = (720)/(6 * 6) = 720/36 = 20. So, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, if I didn't consider the \\(c^0\\) term and just multiplied the entire second expansion by the first coefficient, I would have a polynomial in \\(c\\), but the problem specifically asks for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term without any \\(c\\)s, so it must be the constant term in the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient is indeed 120.\n\nWait, but let me think again. The problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\" in the entire product. So, in the product, each term is a combination of a term from the first expansion and a term from the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be present in the product as \\(a^2b^2 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times the entire second expansion. But that can't be right because then the coefficient would be a polynomial, not a single number. So, perhaps the problem is indeed asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120, as I calculated earlier.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me try another approach. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first expansion, and it's multiplied by every term from the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient from the first expansion, 6, multiplied by the entire second expansion, which is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a single coefficient. So, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is a specific term where the exponents of \\(c\\) are zero, meaning it's a constant term. That makes sense because then the coefficient would be a number.\n\nSo, to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), I need to multiply the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion, which is 6, by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) from the second expansion, which is 20. Therefore, the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not missing anything else. Is there any other term in the second expansion that could contribute to \\(a^2b^2\\) when multiplied by a term from the first expansion? For example, could a term with \\(c^1\\) or \\(c^{-1}\\) somehow combine with a term from the first expansion to give \\(a^2b^2\\)? But no, because the first expansion only has terms with \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), so any term from the second expansion would only affect the power of \\(c\\), not the powers of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). Therefore, the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is to take the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first expansion and multiply it by the \\(c^0\\) term from the second expansion. So, the coefficient is indeed 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Suppose I don't consider the \\(c\\) terms at all. If I just look at the product \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), and I want the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. So, I think the correct interpretation is that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is written incorrectly, and it's supposed to be \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), and we're supposed to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). That seems more consistent because otherwise, the coefficient would be a polynomial, not a number.\n\nSo, to summarize, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is found by multiplying the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion, which is 6, by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) from the second expansion, which is 20, giving a total coefficient of 120.\n\nI think that's it. Let me just recap:\n\n1. Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\binom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n\n2. Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem. The term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0 is when \\(m = 3\\), giving the coefficient \\(\\binom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n\n3. Multiply the two coefficients: \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is 120.\n\nWait, but the problem didn't specify the \\(c^0\\) term, so maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me check the problem again: it just says the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, perhaps I need to consider that in the entire product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) can be multiplied by any power of \\(c\\), so the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. Therefore, I think the problem must be asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is written differently, and the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), and we're to consider only the terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) appears, regardless of the power of \\(c\\). But in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial, not a single number. So, that can't be right.\n\nTherefore, I think the correct interpretation is that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Suppose I don't consider the \\(c\\) terms at all. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so maybe I can ignore the \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) part because it's multiplied by the entire \\((a + b)^4\\) expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by every term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the entire \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) expansion. But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. Therefore, I think the problem must have a typo, or I'm misinterpreting it. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, considering all possible powers of \\(c\\), but that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, which doesn't make sense. So, I think the correct approach is to consider that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nWait, but maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me try to think differently. The problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, perhaps the answer is just 6, because that's the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion, and the second expansion doesn't affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) because it's multiplied by terms involving \\(c\\). But that doesn't seem right because when you multiply by the entire second expansion, the coefficient would be scaled by each term in the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually be 6 times the entire second expansion, which is a polynomial, not a number. Therefore, that can't be right.\n\nI think I need to stick with my initial approach, which is that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. So, the coefficient is 120.\n\nWait, let me try to see if there's another way to approach this. Maybe I can consider the entire product and look for terms where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2 each, and the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0. So, in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term is a product of a term from the first expansion and a term from the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first expansion, and to get \\(c^0\\), we need the term from the second expansion where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, which we found to be 20. Therefore, the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is 120. Since the problem didn't specify the exponent of \\(c\\), but just asked for \\(a^2b^2\\), perhaps it's implied that we're looking for the term where \\(c\\) is also raised to the 0 power, making it a constant term. Therefore, the coefficient is 120.\n\nI think that's the answer. Let me just recap:\n\n1. Find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\): \\(\\binom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n\n2. Find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\): \\(\\binom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n\n3. Multiply the two coefficients: \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) (assuming \\(c^0\\)) is 120.\n\nI think that's the correct approach. I don't see any mistakes in the calculations, so I'm confident that the coefficient is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is found by considering the product of the coefficients from each part of the expression. \n\n1. From \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\binom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n2. From \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\binom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n\nMultiplying these coefficients gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}."

    "text": " \n\nFirst, I remember that when you have an expression like \\((a + b)^n\\), you can expand it using the binomial theorem. The binomial theorem says that \\((a + b)^n = \\sum_{k=0}^{n} \\dbinom{n}{k} a^{n - k} b^k\\). So, maybe I can apply that here.\n\nThe problem is asking specifically for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). That means I need to find the term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2. \n\nLet me write out the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\). Using the binomial theorem, each term is \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k} b^k\\) for \\(k = 0\\) to \\(4\\). So, the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) occurs would be when \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). Let me check that: if \\(k = 2\\), then the term is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} a^{2} b^{2}\\). \n\nCalculating the binomial coefficient \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\), I think that's 6. Yeah, because \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient from the \\((a + b)^4\\) part is 6.\n\nNow, the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I guess I need to consider how this part affects the coefficient. But wait, the term we're looking for is \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\). So, does that mean the coefficient from the \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) part just gets multiplied by 6?\n\nWait, let me make sure. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression. So, actually, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4\\) times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when we multiply them together, each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nBut since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't have any \\(c\\) terms, we just need to consider the term where the \\(c\\) parts cancel out to 1, right? Because otherwise, the term would have some \\(c\\) or \\(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\) in it, which isn't part of \\(a^2b^2\\). \n\nWait, no, actually, \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), so when we multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the only way to get a term without \\(c\\) is to have the \\(c\\) parts multiply to 1. So, in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we need to find the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, because \\(c^0 = 1\\), which doesn't affect the term.\n\nSo, let's find the term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. Using the binomial theorem again, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). \n\nWe need the exponent \\(6 - 2k\\) to be zero. So, solving \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} c^{0} = \\dbinom{6}{3}\\). \n\nCalculating \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\), that's \\(\\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). So, the coefficient from the \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) part is 20.\n\nNow, since the original expression is the product of \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by the term with \\(c^0\\) from the second part. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the two coefficients we found: 6 and 20.\n\nSo, 6 times 20 is 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120.\n\nWait, let me double-check to make sure I didn't make a mistake. \n\nFirst, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). \n\nThen, in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term with \\(c^0\\) is when \\(k = 3\\), so the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). \n\nMultiplying these together, 6 * 20 = 120. That seems right.\n\nI think that's the correct answer.

Using the binomial theorem, each term is:\n\\[\n\\binom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\binom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n\\]\nWe need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, which occurs when \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(k = 3\\). The term is:\n\\[\n\\binom{6}{3} c^0 = 20\n\\]\nThe coefficient here is 20.\n\nMultiplying the coefficients from both parts, we get:\n\\[\n6 \\times 20 = 120\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}."

Because when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial.\n\nWait, that might make sense. Because if you have \\(6a^2b^2\\) multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), then the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, so the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be \\(6\\) times the sum of the coefficients of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nBut let me think again. The sum of the coefficients in a polynomial is found by setting all variables to 1. So, if I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) becomes \\((1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial is 64.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\nWait, but that seems too straightforward. Let me check if that's correct. Alternatively, maybe I should consider that each term in the product is \\(a^kb^{4 - k}c^m\\) or something, but since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of c, then yes, it's 6 times the sum of coefficients in the second polynomial.\n\nBut let me think another way. Suppose I don't consider the c terms. Then, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, as we saw earlier. But when we multiply by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in the expansion of that would be multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), so the coefficient would be 6 times each term's coefficient in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But if the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of c, then it's 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 6*64=384.\n\nWait, but I'm not sure if that's the right approach. Maybe I should think about it differently. Let's consider that when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each polynomial. But in this case, we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which comes from the first polynomial, and it's multiplied by all possible terms from the second polynomial, which involve c. So, the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of the second polynomial. But that doesn't make sense because the expansion of the second polynomial includes terms with different powers of c. So, perhaps the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 6*64=384.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me try to write out the product. So, \\((a + b)^4\\) gives us terms up to \\(a^4\\) and \\(b^4\\), and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) gives us terms involving \\(c^6, c^4, c^2, c^0, c^{-2}, c^{-4}, c^{-6}\\). So, when we multiply these two, each term from the first polynomial is multiplied by each term from the second. So, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be \\(6\\) times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion. As I thought before, the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion is 64, so 6*64=384.\n\nWait, but let me make sure. The sum of coefficients in a polynomial is indeed found by substituting each variable with 1. So, for \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), substituting c=1 gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the sum of all coefficients is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6*64=384.\n\nBut let me think again. Alternatively, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of the c terms. So, if I consider that, then yes, it's 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial. So, 6*64=384.\n\nWait, but I'm not entirely confident. Let me try another approach. Let's consider the entire expansion. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, as we saw. Now, when we multiply by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in the product will be of the form \\(6a^2b^2 \\times\\) (some term from the second expansion). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, because each term in the second expansion is being multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the sum of the coefficients of all the terms in the second expansion.\n\nTherefore, the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion is 64, so 6*64=384.\n\nWait, but let me confirm this with an example. Suppose I have a simpler case: \\((a + b)^1 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). So, expanding, we get \\((a + b)(c + 1/c)\\). The coefficient of \\(a^1b^0\\) would be 1 times the sum of coefficients in the second expansion, which is 1 + 1=2. So, the coefficient of \\(a\\) in the product would be 2, which is correct because the product would be \\(ac + a/c + bc + b/c\\). The coefficient of \\(a\\) is indeed 2, as in \\(ac\\) and \\(a/c\\) both have coefficient 1, but when considering the coefficient of \\(a\\) regardless of c, it's 2.\n\nWait, but in that case, the coefficient of \\(a\\) is 2, which is the same as 1 (from the first expansion) times 2 (sum of coefficients in the second expansion). So, applying that logic, in the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times 64, which is 384.\n\nWait, but another way to think about it is that when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each polynomial. But in this case, since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which only comes from the first polynomial, and the second polynomial is being multiplied in full, the coefficient would be 6 times the entire second polynomial. But that seems a bit off because the second polynomial isn't a single term.\n\nWait, maybe I should think of it as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product being the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial and the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial. Because each term in the second polynomial is being multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), so the total coefficient would be 6 times the sum of coefficients in the second polynomial.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So, the sum of coefficients in the second polynomial is 64, so 6*64=384.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. Let's consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem, it's \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, the coefficients are \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}\\) for each term \\(c^{6 - 2k}\\). The sum of these coefficients is when c=1, which is \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the sum of coefficients is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6*64=384.\n\nWait, but let me think again. If I have two polynomials, P(a, b) and Q(c), then the coefficient of a specific term in P(a, b) times the entire Q(c) would be the coefficient in P times the sum of coefficients in Q. So, yes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem had asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some specific k, then we would have to find the product of the coefficients from each polynomial. But since it's just asking for \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of c, then it's 6 times the sum of coefficients in Q, which is 64, so 6*64=384.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because the problem is written as \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, it's a product of two separate polynomials, one in a and b, and the other in c. Therefore, when we multiply them, the variables are independent. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would indeed be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\).\n\nTherefore, 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not missing anything. Let me think about it differently. Suppose I set c=1, then the entire expression becomes \\((a + b)^4 * 2^6\\), which is \\((a + b)^4 * 64\\). Then, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in this expression would be 6*64=384, which matches what I thought earlier. So, that seems to confirm it.\n\nAlternatively, if I set c to some other value, it shouldn't affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) because we're only interested in the terms involving a and b. So, the coefficient remains 6 times the sum of coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 64, so 384.\n\nWait, but let me think about another example to test this logic. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^2 * (c + 1/c)^1\\). The coefficient of \\(a^2b^0\\) in the first polynomial is 1, and the sum of coefficients in the second polynomial is 2 (since \\((1 + 1)^1=2\\)). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^0\\) in the product would be 1*2=2. Let's expand it: \\((a + b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2\\), and \\((c + 1/c)\\) is c + 1/c. Multiplying them together, we get \\(a^2c + a^2/c + 2abc + 2ab/c + b^2c + b^2/c\\). The coefficient of \\(a^2\\) is 1 for \\(a^2c\\) and 1 for \\(a^2/c\\), so total coefficient is 2, which matches 1*2=2. So, that works.\n\nSimilarly, if I take \\((a + b)^3 * (c + 1/c)^2\\), the coefficient of \\(a^3b^0\\) would be 1 times the sum of coefficients in the second expansion, which is \\((1 + 1)^2=4\\). So, 1*4=4. Let me check: \\((a + b)^3 = a^3 + 3a^2b + 3ab^2 + b^3\\), and \\((c + 1/c)^2 = c^2 + 2 + 1/c^2\\). Multiplying, the term \\(a^3\\) would be multiplied by each term in the second polynomial, giving \\(a^3c^2 + 2a^3 + a^3/c^2\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^3\\) is 1 + 2 + 1 = 4, which is correct.\n\nSo, applying this logic back to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 64, so the coefficient in the product is 6*64=384.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me think about how the multiplication works. Each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, which includes \\(c^6, c^4, c^2, 1, c^{-2}, c^{-4}, c^{-6}\\), each with their respective coefficients. Therefore, in the product, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^6\\) is 6*1=6, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^4\\) is 6*6=36, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^2\\) is 6*15=90, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) (times 1) is 6*20=120, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^{-2}\\) is 6*15=90, and so on. Wait, no, that's not correct because the coefficients in the second expansion are \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}\\) for each term.\n\nWait, let me correct that. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, the coefficients are \\(\\dbinom{6}{0}=1\\) for \\(c^6\\), \\(\\dbinom{6}{1}=6\\) for \\(c^4\\), \\(\\dbinom{6}{2}=15\\) for \\(c^2\\), \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}=20\\) for \\(c^0\\), \\(\\dbinom{6}{4}=15\\) for \\(c^{-2}\\), \\(\\dbinom{6}{5}=6\\) for \\(c^{-4}\\), and \\(\\dbinom{6}{6}=1\\) for \\(c^{-6}\\).\n\nSo, when we multiply \\(6a^2b^2\\) by each of these terms, we get:\n\n- \\(6a^2b^2 \\times 1 \\times c^6 = 6a^2b^2c^6\\)\n- \\(6a^2b^2 \\times 6 \\times c^4 = 36a^2b^2c^4\\)\n- \\(6a^2b^2 \\times 15 \\times c^2 = 90a^2b^2c^2\\)\n- \\(6a^2b^2 \\times 20 \\times 1 = 120a^2b^2\\)\n- \\(6a^2b^2 \\times 15 \\times c^{-2} = 90a^2b^2c^{-2}\\)\n- \\(6a^2b^2 \\times 6 \\times c^{-4} = 36a^2b^2c^{-4}\\)\n- \\(6a^2b^2 \\times 1 \\times c^{-6} = 6a^2b^2c^{-6}\\)\n\nSo, in the product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is present with a coefficient of 120, and all other terms involving \\(a^2b^2\\) have coefficients multiplied by different powers of c.\n\nWait, but the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not considering the power of c. So, in the product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is present as \\(120a^2b^2\\), and that's the only term where the power of c is zero. The other terms have \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by \\(c^6\\), \\(c^4\\), etc. So, if the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without considering c, then it's 120.\n\nWait, that contradicts my earlier conclusion of 384. So, now I'm confused. Which one is correct?\n\nWait, perhaps I misinterpreted the problem. The problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)\". So, it's possible that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of c, meaning only the term where the power of c is zero, i.e., the constant term. In that case, the coefficient would be 120.\n\nBut earlier, I thought it was asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, which would include all terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any power of c. But in that case, the coefficient would be the sum of all coefficients of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for all k, which would be 6*(sum of coefficients in the second polynomial) = 6*64=384.\n\nBut in the expansion, when we multiply \\(6a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second polynomial, each term becomes \\(6 \\times \\text{coefficient} \\times a^2b^2c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) specifically (without any c terms) is when k=3, which gives \\(6 \\times \\dbinom{6}{3} = 6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nWait, so if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of c, then it's 120. But if it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by any power of c, then it's 384. But the problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", so I think it's referring to the term where the variables are exactly \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the c terms. So, that would be 120.\n\nWait, but in the expansion, \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by different powers of c, so the term \\(a^2b^2\\) itself (with c^0) has a coefficient of 120, while the other terms have \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) with different coefficients. So, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), it's 120.\n\nWait, but in my earlier approach, I thought of it as 6 times the sum of coefficients in the second polynomial, which would be 384, but that would be the case if we were considering the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by any c terms, i.e., the coefficient when considering all possible c terms. But if the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of c, then it's 120.\n\nHmm, I'm a bit confused now. Let me try to clarify.\n\nThe problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, in the product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) can appear with different powers of c. So, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for any k, then the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 384. But if the problem is asking specifically for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without any c terms, i.e., \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then the coefficient is 120.\n\nBut the problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", without specifying any power of c. So, I think it's referring to the term where the power of c is zero, i.e., the constant term. Therefore, the coefficient is 120.\n\nWait, but let me check that logic again. If I have two polynomials multiplied together, and I'm looking for the coefficient of a specific term in one variable, say, \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the other variables, then I need to sum the coefficients of all terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any power of c. So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 6*64=384.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, considering that the product is a polynomial in a, b, and c, then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would include all terms where the exponents of a and b are 2 and 2, respectively, regardless of the exponent of c. Therefore, the coefficient would be the sum of all coefficients from the second polynomial, multiplied by 6. So, 6*64=384.\n\nWait, but in my earlier expansion, I saw that the term \\(a^2b^2\\) with c^0 has a coefficient of 120, and all other terms with \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) have coefficients like 6, 36, 90, etc. So, if I sum all these coefficients, I get 6 + 36 + 90 + 120 + 90 + 36 + 6 = let's see:\n\n6 + 36 = 42\n42 + 90 = 132\n132 + 120 = 252\n252 + 90 = 342\n342 + 36 = 378\n378 + 6 = 384\n\nSo, the sum of all coefficients of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for all k is 384, which is 6*64. Therefore, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of the power of c, then it's 384. But if it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) with c^0, then it's 120.\n\nWait, but the problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\". So, does that mean considering all powers of c, or just the term where c is zero? I think it's the former, because in polynomial terms, the coefficient of a specific monomial includes all terms where that monomial appears, regardless of other variables. So, in this case, the monomial \\(a^2b^2\\) can appear multiplied by any power of c, so the coefficient would be the sum of all coefficients from the second polynomial times 6, which is 384.\n\nBut earlier, I thought that the problem might be asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of c, meaning only the term where c is zero. But now, considering that the problem didn't specify any power of c, I think it's referring to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, which includes all terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any power of c. Therefore, the coefficient is 384.\n\nWait, but I'm not entirely sure. Let me think again. If the problem had asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it would be 120. But since it's just asking for \\(a^2b^2\\), it's more likely that it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of c, which would be 384.\n\nWait, but in the expansion, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is only present as \\(120a^2b^2\\). The other terms are \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), which are different monomials. So, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), it's only referring to the term where c is zero, so 120.\n\nWait, I'm getting conflicting conclusions here. Let me try to clarify.\n\nIn the product \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term is of the form \\(a^kb^{4 - k}c^{6 - 2m}\\), where k ranges from 0 to 4, and m ranges from 0 to 6. So, the monomial \\(a^2b^2\\) would correspond to k=2, and any m from 0 to 6. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^{6 - 2m}\\) for each m is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, considering all possible powers of c, would be the sum over m of \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}\\).\n\nWait, but \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) is 6, and the sum over m of \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\) is \\(2^6=64\\). Therefore, the sum is 6*64=384.\n\nWait, that makes sense. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, considering all possible powers of c, is 384.\n\nBut then, earlier, I thought that the term \\(a^2b^2\\) with c^0 has a coefficient of 120. So, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of c, it's 384, but if it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), it's 120.\n\nBut the problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\". So, does that include all powers of c, or only the term where c is zero? I think in polynomial terms, the coefficient of a monomial like \\(a^2b^2\\) would include all terms where that monomial appears, regardless of other variables. So, in this case, \\(a^2b^2\\) appears multiplied by various powers of c, so the coefficient would be the sum of all those coefficients, which is 384.\n\nWait, but in the expansion, \\(a^2b^2\\) is only present once as \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) with coefficient 120, and all other terms have different exponents of c. So, perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nWait, but the problem didn't specify any power of c, so I'm not sure. Maybe I should check the problem statement again.\n\nThe problem says: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\"\n\nHmm, it's a bit ambiguous. But in the context of such problems, usually, when they ask for the coefficient of a specific monomial, they mean the coefficient when considering all possible terms, i.e., the sum of coefficients for that monomial across all other variables. So, in this case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the sum of all coefficients where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any power of c, which is 384.\n\nBut I'm still a bit unsure because in the expansion, \\(a^2b^2\\) is only present once with c^0, and the other terms are different monomials. So, perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nWait, but let me think about it another way. If I set c=1, then the expression becomes \\((a + b)^4 * (1 + 1)^6 = (a + b)^4 * 64\\). Then, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in this expression is 6*64=384. So, that suggests that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the original expression is 384, because when c=1, all the c terms become 1, and the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 384.\n\nAlternatively, if I set c=1, then the entire expression becomes a polynomial in a and b, and the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 384, which matches the earlier result.\n\nTherefore, I think the correct answer is 384.\n\nWait, but earlier, when I considered the expansion, I saw that the term \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) has a coefficient of 120, and the other terms with \\(a^2b^2\\) have coefficients that sum up to 384. So, if I'm considering the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of c, it's 384, but if I'm considering only the term where c=0, it's 120.\n\nGiven that the problem didn't specify any power of c, I think it's more reasonable to assume that it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of c, so 384.\n\nWait, but I'm still a bit confused because in the expansion, \\(a^2b^2\\) is only present once with c^0, and the other terms have different exponents. So, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nWait, perhaps I should check the problem again. It says: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\"\n\nIn this context, since the expression involves both a, b, and c, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would only exist as \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some k. So, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without any c terms, then it's 120. But if it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, regardless of c, then it's 384.\n\nWait, but in polynomial terms, the coefficient of a monomial is the sum of all coefficients where that monomial appears. So, in this case, the monomial \\(a^2b^2\\) appears in the product multiplied by various powers of c, so the coefficient would be the sum of all those coefficients, which is 384.\n\nBut wait, in reality, the monomial \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't include any c terms, so perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of the c terms. So, in that case, it's 120, because the term \\(a^2b^2\\) with c^0 is 120.\n\nWait, I'm getting myself more confused. Let me try to clarify.\n\nIn the product \\((a + b)^"

    "text": " I'm a bit confused because there are two variables, a and b, and another part with c and 1/c. Maybe I should break it down into smaller parts.\n\nFirst, I remember that when you have an expression like \\((a + b)^n\\), you can expand it using the binomial theorem. The binomial theorem says that each term in the expansion is of the form \\(\\dbinom{n}{k} a^{n - k}b^{k}\\), right? So, for \\((a + b)^4\\), I can write it as the sum from k = 0 to 4 of \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}a^{4 - k}b^{k}\\).\n\nSince the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I think I need to find the term where the exponents of a and b are both 2. That would mean I'm looking for the term where \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). Let me check that: if \\(4 - k = 2\\), then k is indeed 2. So, the coefficient for that term would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\).\n\nCalculating that, \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) is 6. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. But wait, the entire expression also includes \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Does that affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)? Hmm, I think so because when you multiply two expressions together, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 multiplied by whatever the coefficient is for the term that doesn't involve a or b in the second expression.\n\nWait, but the second expression is in terms of c and 1/c, so the term that doesn't involve a or b would just be 1, right? Because if I'm only looking for \\(a^2b^2\\), I don't want any c terms. So, maybe I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is the term where the exponent of c is zero. That way, when I multiply it by \\(a^2b^2\\), the result is just \\(a^2b^2\\) times that constant, so the coefficient would be 6 times that constant.\n\nAlright, so now I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me use the binomial theorem again for this part. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) would be the sum from m = 0 to 6 of \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - m}\\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\).\n\nSimplifying that, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - m} \\times c^{-m}\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\). I need the term where the exponent of c is zero, so I set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for m, I get \\(2m = 6\\), so m = 3. Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\).\n\nCalculating \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\), that's 20. So, the constant term is 20. Now, going back to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the product of the coefficient from the first part and the constant term from the second part. So, that would be 6 (from \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expression) multiplied by 20 (the constant term from the second expression).\n\nLet me do that multiplication: 6 times 20 is 120. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression should be 120. Wait, let me double-check to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nFirst, I found the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) correctly as 6. Then, I correctly identified that I needed the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which I found by setting the exponent equal to zero and solving for m, getting m = 3. The binomial coefficient \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\) is indeed 20. Multiplying 6 and 20 gives 120, so that seems right.\n\nI think that's it. So, the coefficient is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is found using the binomial theorem. The term is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\\). Next, we find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem, the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying these coefficients together, we get \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\boxed{120}."

    "text": " \n\nFirst, I know that when dealing with expressions like \\((a + b)^n\\), the coefficients of specific terms can be found using the binomial theorem. The binomial theorem says that \\((a + b)^n = \\sum_{k=0}^{n} \\dbinom{n}{k} a^{n - k} b^k\\). So, maybe I can apply that here.\n\nBut wait, the expression isn't just \\((a + b)^4\\); it's multiplied by another binomial expression \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I think I need to consider both parts separately and then see how they interact.\n\nLet me break it down. I need the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product of two expansions: one from \\((a + b)^4\\) and the other from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nFirst, let's handle \\((a + b)^4\\). Using the binomial theorem, the expansion will have terms like \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k} b^k\\) for \\(k = 0\\) to \\(4\\). I'm specifically looking for the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2. That would be when \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\), right? So, the coefficient here is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\).\n\nCalculating that, \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\nNow, the other part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I need to figure out how this part affects the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, but \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) are separate variables from \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). So, when I multiply the two expansions together, the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are independent of the terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). \n\nThat means, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) will be the same as in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, no, that doesn't make sense because when you multiply two polynomials, each term from the first polynomial is multiplied by each term from the second polynomial. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nWait, but that can't be right because \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) are variables, and unless we're considering terms where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out, which would be the constant term. Hmm, so maybe I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because that would be the only term that doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), and thus when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), it would contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\).\n\nWait, let me think again. So, the product is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is a term with \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) raised to some powers, and each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is a term with \\(c\\) raised to some power. When we multiply these two together, each term from the first expansion is multiplied by each term from the second. \n\nBut the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\) at all. So, in order for the product to result in a term that's just \\(a^2b^2\\), the \\(c\\) terms must cancel out. That is, we need a term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) that is a constant, i.e., where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero.\n\nSo, first, let's find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem again, the expansion is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(1/c\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). \n\nWe want the exponent of \\(c\\) to be zero, so we set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n\nSo, the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 20. \n\nNow, going back to the original product. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) has a coefficient of 6, as we found earlier. When we multiply this by the constant term 20 from the other expansion, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product becomes \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nWait, but let me double-check to make sure I didn't miss anything. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 20. Multiplying these together gives 120. \n\nIs there any other term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) that could contribute to the \\(a^2b^2\\) term? For instance, if there were terms with \\(c^1\\) or \\(c^{-1}\\), but when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), they would result in terms like \\(a^2b^2c\\) or \\(a^2b^2/c\\), which are not \\(a^2b^2\\). So, only the constant term contributes to \\(a^2b^2\\), so the coefficient is indeed 120.\n\nWait, but hold on a second. Let me think again. When you multiply two polynomials, each term from the first is multiplied by each term from the second. So, in this case, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6\\(a^2b^2\\). Then, when multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term will have some power of \\(c\\), but only the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero will contribute to the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the product. All other terms will have extra \\(c\\) factors, so they won't be part of the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. \n\nTherefore, the coefficient is just 6 multiplied by the constant term in the second expansion, which is 20, so 6 * 20 = 120. That seems right.\n\nWait another thought: is the problem perhaps asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\)? Because in the product, the term would actually be \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is just \\(a^2b^2\\). So, yes, that makes sense. So, the coefficient is 120.\n\nI think that's the correct approach. So, to recap: \n\n1. Find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6.\n2. Find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 20.\n3. Multiply these two coefficients together to get 120.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120.\n\nWait, but just to make sure I didn't make a mistake in calculating the binomial coefficients. Let me verify:\n\nFor \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). That's correct.\n\nFor \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the constant term is when \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), so \\(k = 3\\). The coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). That's correct too.\n\nSo, 6 * 20 is indeed 120. \n\nWait, but let me also think about the overall expansion. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). When expanded, each term is of the form \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^{k} \\times \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, to get a term that is \\(a^2b^2\\), we need \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\), so that's the 6 coefficient. Then, for the \\(c\\) terms, we need \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), so \\(m = 3\\), giving the 20 coefficient. So, the term is 6 * 20 * \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120\\(a^2b^2\\). \n\nTherefore, the coefficient is 120. I think that's correct.\n\nI don't see any mistakes in my reasoning. So, I think the answer is 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break down the problem into two parts:\n\n1. **Finding the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\):**\n   Using the binomial theorem, the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is given by:\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k} b^k\n   \\]\n   The term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\).

    "text": " \n\nFirst, I remember that when you have an expression like \\((a + b)^n\\), you can expand it using the binomial theorem. The binomial theorem says that \\((a + b)^n = \\sum_{k=0}^{n} \\dbinom{n}{k} a^{n - k} b^{k}\\). So, each term in the expansion is of the form \\(\\dbinom{n}{k} a^{n - k} b^{k}\\), where \\(k\\) goes from 0 to \\(n\\).\n\nIn this problem, the first part is \\((a + b)^4\\). So, I can expand this using the binomial theorem. Let me write that out:\n\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k} b^{k}\n\\]\n\nSo, the terms in this expansion will be:\n\n- When \\(k = 0\\): \\(\\dbinom{4}{0} a^4 b^0 = 1 \\cdot a^4 \\cdot 1 = a^4\\)\n- When \\(k = 1\\): \\(\\dbinom{4}{1} a^3 b^1 = 4 \\cdot a^3 b\\)\n- When \\(k = 2\\): \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} a^2 b^2 = 6 \\cdot a^2 b^2\\)\n- When \\(k = 3\\): \\(\\dbinom{4}{3} a^1 b^3 = 4 \\cdot a b^3\\)\n- When \\(k = 4\\): \\(\\dbinom{4}{4} a^0 b^4 = 1 \\cdot b^4\\)\n\nSo, the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is \\(a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). \n\nNow, I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Looking at the expansion, the term with \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(6a^2b^2\\), so its coefficient is 6. \n\nBut wait, the problem isn't just \\((a + b)^4\\); it's multiplied by another expression, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I need to consider the entire expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nHmm, okay. So, the expression is a product of two binomial expansions. To find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I think I need to consider how the multiplication works. \n\nWait, but \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are variables separate from \\(c\\), right? So, in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the variables \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are only present in the first part, and \\(c\\) is only in the second part. \n\nSo, when I multiply these two expressions together, the terms from \\((a + b)^4\\) will multiply the terms from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are different variables, the product will have terms that are combinations of these variables. \n\nBut the question is specifically asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). That term doesn't involve \\(c\\) at all, right? Because \\(a^2b^2\\) has no \\(c\\) in it. So, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the only way to get a term without \\(c\\) is if I multiply a term from \\((a + b)^4\\) by a term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) that has \\(c^0\\), which is 1. \n\nWait, let me think about that again. Because \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) can be expanded using the binomial theorem as well. Each term in that expansion will be of the form \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). \n\nSo, the exponent of \\(c\\) in each term is \\(6 - 2m\\), where \\(m\\) goes from 0 to 6. So, for each term, the exponent is \\(6 - 2m\\). \n\nIf I want a term that doesn't have \\(c\\), i.e., \\(c^0\\), then I need \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Let me solve for \\(m\\):\n\n\\(6 - 2m = 0\\)\n\n\\(2m = 6\\)\n\n\\(m = 3\\)\n\nSo, the term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) that has \\(c^0\\) is when \\(m = 3\\). Let me compute that term:\n\n\\[\n\\dbinom{6}{3} c^{6 - 2 \\cdot 3} = \\dbinom{6}{3} c^{0} = 20 \\cdot 1 = 20\n\\]\n\nSo, the constant term (the term without \\(c\\)) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. \n\nTherefore, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the only way to get a term with \\(a^2b^2\\) is to multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from \\((a + b)^4\\) by the constant term 20 from the second expansion. \n\nFrom earlier, I found that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. So, when I multiply this by 20, the coefficient becomes \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nWait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake here. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first expansion with coefficient 6, and the term without \\(c\\) in the second expansion is 20. So, when you multiply these two, the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nIs there any other way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product? Let me think. Since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are only in the first part, and \\(c\\) is only in the second part, any term in the product will be of the form \\(a^k b^{4 - k} \\times c^{m}\\) or \\(a^k b^{4 - k} \\times c^{-m}\\) or something like that, depending on the exponents. \n\nBut since \\(a^2b^2\\) has no \\(c\\) at all, it must come from the product of the term with \\(a^2b^2\\) (which is 6a\u00b2b\u00b2) and the term with \\(c^0\\) (which is 20). So, I think that's the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient should be 120. \n\nWait, let me just double-check. Maybe I can think of the entire expansion as a product of two polynomials. The first polynomial has terms in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the second has terms in \\(c\\). So, when you multiply them, each term in the first polynomial gets multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. \n\nSo, if I want a term that only has \\(a^2b^2\\), I need to pick the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first polynomial and the constant term (with \\(c^0\\)) from the second polynomial. \n\nSo, the coefficient is indeed 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but let me think again. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but does that term exist in the entire product? Because in the product, each term is a combination of \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\). So, unless the term is \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), it won't be just \\(a^2b^2\\). \n\nBut in the product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by 20 is \\(20a^2b^2\\), which is indeed a term with \\(a^2b^2\\). So, that's the only term with \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product because any other term would have some power of \\(c\\) as well. \n\nSo, I think my reasoning is correct. The coefficient is 120.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make any calculation mistakes. Let me compute the binomial coefficients again.\n\nFor \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\), which is 6. That's correct.\n\nFor \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term with \\(c^0\\) is when \\(m = 3\\), so the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\), which is 20. That's correct.\n\nSo, multiplying 6 and 20 gives 120. So, the coefficient is 120.\n\nI think that's the answer.

    "text": " \n\nFirst, I remember that when expanding expressions like \\((a + b)^n\\), the coefficients can be found using the binomial theorem. The binomial theorem says that \\((a + b)^n = \\sum_{k=0}^{n} \\dbinom{n}{k} a^{n - k} b^k\\). So, maybe I can apply this here.\n\nThe problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\), I need to find the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2. Let me write that out.\n\nUsing the binomial theorem on \\((a + b)^4\\), the general term is \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k} b^k\\). So, I want the term where \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). Let me check that: if \\(k = 2\\), then the term is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} a^{2} b^{2}\\). \n\nCalculating \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\), that's 6. So, the coefficient from the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), is 6. \n\nNow, the expression also has \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but the term we're looking for is \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\). So, does that mean that the coefficient from the second part doesn't matter? Or is there a chance that the second part could contribute to the \\(a^2b^2\\) term somehow? Hmm, let me think.\n\nWait, no. Because the second part is multiplied by the first part, so when we multiply two polynomials, each term from the first polynomial gets multiplied by each term from the second polynomial. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), we need to find the terms in the second expansion that are constants, i.e., where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out, so that when multiplied by the \\(a^2b^2\\) term, it remains as part of the \\(a^2b^2\\) coefficient.\n\nWait, actually, no. Let me clarify. The problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product. So, the product will have terms that are combinations of terms from each expansion. So, for example, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nBut since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), we need to find all the terms in the second expansion that are constants (i.e., \\(c^0\\)), because only those will multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term without introducing any \\(c\\) terms. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part.\n\nSo, first, let me confirm that. So, the overall expression is the product of two expansions: \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when we multiply them, each term from the first expansion is multiplied by each term from the second. So, to get a term that's just \\(a^2b^2\\) (without any \\(c\\) terms), we need to multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first expansion by a term from the second expansion that is \\(c^0\\), i.e., a constant term. Therefore, the coefficient will be the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part.\n\nWait, but is that the only way? Let me think. Suppose we have a term in the second expansion that's \\(c^k\\) and another term that's \\(c^{-k}\\), but when multiplied together, they would give a constant term. But in this case, we're looking for the term \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), so we need to consider only the constant term in the second expansion. So, perhaps I need to compute the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of it as the entire product, but since the problem is only about \\(a^2b^2\\), the \\(c\\) terms don't affect that. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just the product of the coefficients from each expansion, as I thought earlier.\n\nWait, but actually, no. Because when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second, so the coefficient for a specific term in the product is the sum over all possible products of coefficients from each expansion that result in that term. But in this case, since we're looking for a term that's purely \\(a^2b^2\\), that is, without any \\(c\\) terms, we need to find all possible ways that when you multiply a term from \\((a + b)^4\\) and a term from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), you end up with \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). So, the only way that can happen is if the term from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is \\(c^0\\), as any other term would introduce a power of \\(c\\), which would make the term have \\(c\\) in it. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\).\n\nSo, first, let's compute the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which I already did earlier. It's \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n\nNext, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Hmm, how do I do that?\n\nLet me think. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) can be done using the binomial theorem as well. The general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\).\n\nWe want the exponent of \\(c\\) to be 0, so we set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\).\n\nSo, the term where \\(k = 3\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} c^{0}\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20.\n\nNow, putting it all together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the two coefficients: 6 (from the first expansion) multiplied by 20 (from the second expansion). So, 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, is that correct? Let me double-check.\n\nWait, but hold on. Actually, in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is indeed the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part, because only then will the product term be \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is just \\(a^2b^2\\).\n\nSo, yes, that seems correct. So, 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in calculating the coefficients. Let me recalculate.\n\nFor \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). That seems right.\n\nFor \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} (1/c)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), so \\(k = 3\\), and the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). That's correct.\n\nSo, 6 * 20 = 120. So, the coefficient is 120.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Is there any other way that the term \\(a^2b^2\\) could be formed? For example, could there be terms from the second expansion that, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), result in \\(a^2b^2\\) times some \\(c\\) terms, but perhaps we're only considering the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\)? Hmm, no, because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which implies that we are looking for the coefficient in the entire product, considering all possible terms. But since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), any term in the product that has \\(a^2b^2\\) must have a \\(c^0\\) term from the second expansion. So, yes, the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but let me think of another approach to confirm. Maybe I can consider the entire expression as a product of two polynomials and see if the coefficient makes sense.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can consider the multinomial expansion, but that might complicate things. Alternatively, maybe I can think of the problem as two separate expansions and see how they interact.\n\nWait, another thought: since the problem is only about \\(a^2b^2\\), perhaps the \\(c\\) terms don't affect this at all. So, maybe I can treat the two parts separately and then multiply the coefficients. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 20, so the total coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nYes, that seems consistent.\n\nWait, but just to be thorough, let me write out the expansions a bit more.\n\nFirst, \\((a + b)^4\\):\n\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\dbinom{4}{0}a^4b^0 + \\dbinom{4}{1}a^3b^1 + \\dbinom{4}{2}a^2b^2 + \\dbinom{4}{3}a^1b^3 + \\dbinom{4}{4}a^0b^4\n\\]\nSo, the term with \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6a^2b^2.\n\nNow, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\):\n\nThe expansion is:\n\n\\[\n\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(1/c\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n\\]\n\nWe want the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\). So, the term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} c^0 = 20\\).\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20.\n\nNow, when we multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) from the first will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), we need to multiply \\(6a^2b^2\\) by the term in the second expansion that is \\(c^0\\), which is 20. So, the resulting term is \\(6 * 20 a^2b^2 = 120a^2b^2\\).\n\nTherefore, the coefficient is 120.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me think if there's any other term in the second expansion that could contribute to \\(a^2b^2\\) when multiplied by some other term from the first expansion. For example, could a term with \\(c^1\\) from the second expansion multiply a term from the first expansion that has \\(c^{-1}\\) to give a constant term? Wait, no, because the first expansion doesn't have any \\(c\\) terms. The first expansion is entirely in terms of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), so when we multiply by the second expansion, which has terms in \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), the only way to get a term without \\(c\\) is to multiply by the \\(c^0\\) term in the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient is indeed 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, another way to think about it: the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in this product is the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum over all terms in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But since we're only interested in terms where the product doesn't involve \\(c\\), it's just the product of the \\(a^2b^2\\) coefficient and the constant term in the second expansion.\n\nSo, yeah, 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but just to be absolutely sure, maybe I can compute the entire product up to the \\(a^2b^2\\) term and see.\n\nBut that might take too long, but let me try.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can consider that the entire expression is a product of two independent expansions, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed the product of the two coefficients, as I thought.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can think of the problem as a product of two polynomials, and the coefficient of a specific term is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each polynomial, provided that the variables don't interfere. Since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), their coefficients are independent.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second polynomial.\n\nSo, 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, let me make sure I didn't make any calculation errors. Let me compute \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) again. 4 choose 2 is 6, correct. 6 choose 3 is 20, correct. So, 6 * 20 is 120.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120.\n\nI think that's it. I can't see any mistakes in my reasoning. So, the final answer should be 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is found by considering the binomial expansions of each part separately and then multiplying the relevant coefficients.\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\)**:\n   - The term with \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\\).\n\n2. **Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)**:\n   - The term with \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}c^0 = 20\\).\n\n3. **Multiply the coefficients**:\n   - \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

So, the overall expression is the product of these two expansions. I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). \n\nWait, but the second part involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), so when I multiply the two expansions together, the terms from the first expansion will multiply the terms from the second expansion. However, since I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), maybe I don't need to consider the \\(c\\) terms because \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\). Is that right?\n\nLet me think. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\), right? Because \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) are separate variables. So, the \\(c\\) terms won't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms when multiplying.

Or maybe I need to consider all the terms in the second expansion and see if they affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Hmm, I'm a bit confused here.\n\nWait, no, actually, when you multiply two expressions, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression. So, if I'm looking for a specific term in the product, like \\(a^2b^2\\), that term would come from multiplying \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion by every possible term from the second expansion. But since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), the coefficient would just be the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. Wait, but that doesn't make sense because the second expansion has multiple terms, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all coefficients from the second part. Hmm, but that seems complicated. Maybe I'm overcomplicating it.\n\nWait, no, actually, since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), when I multiply it by terms from the second expansion, which involve \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), the resulting terms will have \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by some power of \\(c\\). But the original problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, does that mean I'm supposed to consider all possible ways \\(a^2b^2\\) can appear in the product, including multiplied by different powers of \\(c\\)? Or is it asking for the coefficient when considering only the \\(a^2b^2\\) term, regardless of the \\(c\\) part?\n\nWait, actually, the problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)\". So, in the entire product, we're looking for all the terms that have \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of what they have in terms of \\(c\\). So, each such term would be \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by some term from the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Because each term in the second expansion, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), would contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product.\n\nWait, but that seems a bit off. Let me think again. Let's denote the first part as \\( (a + b)^4 \\) and the second part as \\( \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 \\). When we multiply these two, each term in the expansion of the first part is multiplied by each term in the expansion of the second part. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion will be multiplied by every term in the second expansion, which are of the form \\(c^k\\) for \\(k\\) from -6 to 6, stepping by 2, because each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) will have exponents that are even numbers from -6 to 6.\n\nTherefore, in the product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each of these \\(c^k\\) terms. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. Because each term in the second expansion, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), contributes its own coefficient to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product.\n\nWait, but that doesn't seem right because each term in the second expansion has different powers of \\(c\\), but the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would just be the product of the coefficients, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, each of those terms contributes their coefficient to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, but since \\(a^2b^2\\) is being multiplied by each term, the overall coefficient is the product of the coefficients.\n\nWait, no, that's not correct. Let me clarify: when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum of the products of the coefficients of terms in each polynomial that multiply together to give that specific term. But in this case, we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\). So, in the product, \\(a^2b^2\\) can be multiplied by any term from the second expansion, which includes various powers of \\(c\\). But since the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, does that mean we're considering all possible terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present, regardless of what \\(c\\) is multiplied by? \n\nWait, I think I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think of it differently. Let's denote \\(P = (a + b)^4\\) and \\(Q = \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The product \\(P \\times Q\\) will have terms that are products of terms from \\(P\\) and \\(Q\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(P\\) will be multiplied by each term in \\(Q\\), which are of the form \\(c^k\\) where \\(k\\) ranges from -6 to 6 in steps of 2. So, in the product, each term will be \\(a^2b^2c^k\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) in the product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(P\\) multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^k\\) in \\(Q\\). \n\nBut the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, does that mean we're looking for the sum of all coefficients of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for any \\(k\\)? Or is the problem only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when considering the product as a whole, which might involve multiple terms with different \\(c\\) exponents?\n\nWait, actually, no. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which in the product would be the sum of all coefficients where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any power of \\(c\\). So, in other words, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(P\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(Q\\). Because each term in \\(Q\\) contributes its coefficient when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). \n\nWait, but that doesn't seem right because each term in \\(Q\\) has a different power of \\(c\\), but the coefficients are all positive or negative. Let me think again. If I have \\(a^2b^2\\) from \\(P\\), and I multiply it by each term in \\(Q\\), which is \\(\\sum_{k} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\), right? Because the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\).\n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\(P \\times Q\\) would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(P\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(Q\\). Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in \\(Q\\), each term contributes its coefficient to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^{6 - 2k}\\), but since we're only interested in \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, the coefficient would be the product of the coefficients from \\(P\\) and \\(Q\\), summed over all terms in \\(Q\\).\n\nWait, no, that's not quite right. Let me clarify: When you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in \\(Q\\), each term in \\(Q\\) is of the form \\(c^{6 - 2k}\\) with coefficient \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}\\). So, when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each of these terms, you get \\(a^2b^2c^{6 - 2k}\\) with coefficient \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} \\times \\dbinom{6}{k}\\), where \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(P\\). \n\nBut the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, does that mean we're considering all possible terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present, regardless of the \\(c\\) exponent? Or are we supposed to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which would involve summing over all possible \\(c\\) exponents?\n\nWait, I think I'm confusing myself. Let me try to approach this differently. Let's first find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\). Then, since the other part \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is being multiplied, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product will be the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, each term contributes its coefficient to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. So, the total coefficient would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} \\times \\left(\\dbinom{6}{0} + \\dbinom{6}{1} + \\dbinom{6}{2} + \\dbinom{6}{3} + \\dbinom{6}{4} + \\dbinom{6}{5} + \\dbinom{6}{6}\\right)\\).\n\nWait, but that sum is just the sum of the binomial coefficients for \\(n = 6\\), which is \\(2^6 = 64\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} \\times 64\\). \n\nWait, let me check that. The sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), so \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion multiplied by 64.\n\nBut wait, that seems a bit too straightforward. Let me make sure. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Then, the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 64. So, multiplying these together, 6 * 64 = 384. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 384.\n\nWait, but I'm not sure if that's correct because when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term is the sum of the products of the coefficients of terms that multiply to give that specific term. But in this case, since we're looking for \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, it's as if we're treating \\(a^2b^2\\) as a single term and multiplying it by the entire second polynomial, so the coefficient would indeed be 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nBut let me think again. Alternatively, maybe I'm supposed to consider that \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term in the product, and the other part can have any power of \\(c\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it, and the answer is simply the coefficient from the first part because the second part is separate. But that doesn't seem right because the product would involve multiplying each term from the first expansion by each term from the second expansion, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all coefficients from the second part.\n\nWait, let me test this with a simpler example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^1 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, expanding, we get \\(a c + a/c + b c + b/c\\). The coefficient of \\(a\\) in this product would be \\(c + 1/c\\), but if we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a\\) regardless of \\(c\\), it's not straightforward. Wait, but in the original problem, we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), so when you multiply it by terms from the second expansion, each of those terms has a coefficient, and the total coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the sum of all those products.\n\nWait, no, in the product, each term is \\(a^2b^2 \\times c^k\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the sum of the coefficients of \\(c^k\\) in the second expansion multiplied by the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion. But since we're only interested in \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\), the coefficient would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\nWait, but let me double-check. Let's compute the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Then, the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is indeed \\(2^6 = 64\\), as I thought earlier. So, multiplying these together gives 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm supposed to consider that the second expansion doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just 6, and the rest is about \\(c\\). But that can't be right because the entire product is a combination of both expansions, so the coefficient would be scaled by the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion.\n\nWait, another way to think about it: If I have two polynomials, \\(P(x) = p_0 + p_1x + p_2x^2 + \\dots\\) and \\(Q(x) = q_0 + q_1x + q_2x^2 + \\dots\\), then the coefficient of \\(x^k\\) in \\(P(x)Q(x)\\) is the sum over \\(i + j = k\\) of \\(p_i q_j\\). But in our case, \\(P(a, b)\\) is a polynomial in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and \\(Q(c)\\) is a polynomial in \\(c\\). So, when we multiply them, the variables are separate, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(P(a, b)\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(Q(c)\\), because each term in \\(Q(c)\\) will multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term, contributing their coefficients.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is indeed \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\nWait, but I'm still a bit unsure. Let me try another approach. Let's compute the entire expansion and see.\n\nFirst, expand \\((a + b)^4\\). Using the binomial theorem:\n\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k} b^k\n\\]\n\nSo, the term with \\(a^2b^2\\) is when \\(k = 2\\), which gives \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\\).\n\nNow, expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Again, using the binomial theorem:\n\n\\[\n\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n\\]\n\nSo, each term in this expansion is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\).\n\nNow, when we multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\) from the second expansion, resulting in terms like \\(6 \\dbinom{6}{m} a^2b^2 c^{6 - 2m}\\).\n\nTherefore, in the product, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2 c^{6 - 2m}\\) is \\(6 \\dbinom{6}{m}\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, does that mean we're supposed to sum over all possible \\(m\\) to account for all the terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present, each multiplied by different powers of \\(c\\)?\n\nWait, no, because \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term on its own, and in the product, it's being multiplied by each term in the second expansion, each of which has a different power of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is actually the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion. Because each term in the second expansion contributes its coefficient when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), resulting in a term \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by \\(c^{6 - 2m}\\), but since we're only interested in \\(a^2b^2\\), the coefficient would be the sum of all those contributions.\n\nWait, but that doesn't make sense because each term in the second expansion has a different power of \\(c\\), so when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each of those terms, you get different terms in the product, each with a different power of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would only be the coefficient from the first expansion, because the second expansion is in terms of \\(c\\), which is a different variable. So, maybe I was wrong earlier, and the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just 6, because the second expansion doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms.\n\nWait, that seems more plausible. Let me think again. If I have two polynomials multiplied together, one in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the other in \\(c\\), then the variables are independent. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial, because the second polynomial doesn't contain \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), so it doesn't affect their coefficients. Therefore, the coefficient is simply 6.\n\nWait, but that contradicts my earlier reasoning. Let me try to clarify. When you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial, which are all terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). Therefore, in the product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^{6}\\), \\(a^2b^2c^{4}\\), etc., each with their own coefficients. So, in the product, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is not just 6, because \\(a^2b^2\\) is being multiplied by different powers of \\(c\\), each with their own coefficients. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is actually the coefficient from the first polynomial times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial. Because each term in the second polynomial contributes its coefficient when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), resulting in a term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^{6 - 2m}\\), but since we're only interested in \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, the coefficient would be the product of the coefficients from each polynomial, summed over all terms.\n\nWait, no, that's not quite right. Let me think of it as separate variables. Since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are different variables, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial, because the second polynomial doesn't contain \\(a\\) or \\(b\\). Therefore, the coefficient remains 6, and the second polynomial only affects the powers of \\(c\\) in the product terms.\n\nWait, that makes sense. Because when you multiply two polynomials in different variables, the coefficients of terms in one polynomial don't affect the coefficients of terms in the other polynomial. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and the second polynomial affects only the \\(c\\) terms, but not the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was 384, but now I'm thinking it's 6. I must have made a mistake earlier. Let me try to clarify.\n\nWhen you have two polynomials multiplied together, say \\(P(a, b)\\) and \\(Q(c)\\), the product \\(P(a, b) \\times Q(c)\\) will have terms that are products of terms from \\(P\\) and \\(Q\\). So, each term in \\(P\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(Q\\), resulting in terms like \\(a^kb^lc^m\\), where \\(k\\), \\(l\\), and \\(m\\) are exponents. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(P\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(Q\\), because each term in \\(Q\\) contributes its coefficient when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), resulting in terms \\(a^2b^2c^m\\) with different \\(m\\). However, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, does that mean we're considering all possible terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present, each multiplied by a different power of \\(c\\), and summing their coefficients? Or is it asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) irrespective of the \\(c\\) terms, meaning just the coefficient from \\(P\\)?\n\nWait, I think the confusion comes from whether the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, considering all possible \\(c\\) exponents, or just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the part that doesn't involve \\(c\\). \n\nIf the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, considering all possible \\(c\\) exponents, then the coefficient would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(P\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(Q\\), because each term in \\(Q\\) contributes to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). \n\nBut if the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the part that doesn't involve \\(c\\), which would just be the term \\(a^2b^2\\) itself, then the coefficient would be 6, because the second polynomial only affects the \\(c\\) terms, not the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms.\n\nWait, but the problem states: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, in the entire product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) can be multiplied by any power of \\(c\\), but the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would include all such terms. Therefore, the coefficient is the sum of all coefficients of terms \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for any integer \\(k\\). \n\nSo, in other words, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(P\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(Q\\). Because each term in \\(Q\\) contributes its coefficient when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), resulting in a term \\(a^2b^2c^k\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 multiplied by the sum of the coefficients in \\(Q\\), which is 64. So, 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but that seems high. Let me confirm. The sum of the coefficients in \\(Q\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), so \\(Q(1) = (1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the sum of all coefficients in \\(Q\\) is 64. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is indeed 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nBut earlier I thought that since \\(a^2b^2\\) is independent of \\(c\\), the coefficient would just be 6. But now I'm seeing that because each term in \\(Q\\) is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is actually 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(Q\\), which is 64, giving 384.\n\nWait, but that seems counterintuitive because \\(a^2b^2\\) is just a term in \\(P\\), and \\(Q\\) is a separate polynomial in \\(c\\). So, when you multiply them, \\(a^2b^2\\) is being scaled by each term in \\(Q\\), but since \\(Q\\) is a polynomial in \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product should remain 6, because the \\(c\\) terms are separate variables. \n\nWait, no, that's not correct. Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in \\(Q\\), you're getting terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), each with their own coefficients. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the sum of all coefficients of these terms, which is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(P\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(Q\\).\n\nWait, but I'm still confused because in standard polynomial multiplication, the coefficient of a specific term in one variable is not affected by the other variables. For example, if you have \\( (x + y)(a + b) \\), the coefficient of \\(x\\) in the product is 1, because \\(y\\) is multiplied by \\(a + b\\), but \\(x\\) is only multiplied by 1. So, in that case, the coefficient of \\(x\\) remains 1, unaffected by the \\(a + b\\) part.\n\nSimilarly, in our problem, \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term in \\(P\\), and when multiplied by \\(Q\\), each term in \\(Q\\) contributes to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), but the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) itself, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, would just be the coefficient from \\(P\\), which is 6, because the \\(c\\) terms are separate.\n\nWait, but that contradicts the earlier reasoning where I thought it was 6 * 64. Let me try to think of it as separate variables. If I have \\( (a + b)^4 \\) and \\( (c + 1/c)^6 \\), then when I multiply them, each term in the product is a combination of a term from \\( (a + b)^4 \\) and a term from \\( (c + 1/c)^6 \\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from \\( (a + b)^4 \\) is multiplied by each term in \\( (c + 1/c)^6 \\), resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\). Therefore, in the product, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) is \\(6 \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}\\), where \\(k = 6 - 2m\\). \n\nBut the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, does that mean we're looking for the sum of all coefficients where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present, multiplied by any \\(c^k\\)? If so, then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\( (a + b)^4 \\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\( (c + 1/c)^6 \\), which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, considering all possible \\(c\\) exponents, then it's 384. But if it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) irrespective of the \\(c\\) terms, then it's just 6.\n\nWait, the problem says: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, which includes all possible terms with \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by any power of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient is the sum of all coefficients of terms \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for any integer \\(k\\), which is 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\( (c + 1/c)^6 \\), which is 64. So, the answer should be 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but I'm still not entirely sure. Let me think of it another way. If I set \\(c = 1\\), then the second part becomes \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\), and the entire product becomes \\((a + b)^4 \\times 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in this case would be 6 * 64 = 384, which matches our earlier result. So, that seems to confirm that the coefficient is indeed 384.\n\nAlternatively, if I set \\(c = 1\\), I'm effectively summing all the coefficients in the second polynomial, which gives me the total contribution of the second part to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nOkay, I think I've convinced myself that the coefficient is 384. So, the answer should be 384.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{384}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break the problem into two parts: expanding \\((a + b)^4\\) and considering the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\n1. **Expanding \\((a + b)^4\\)**:\n   Using the binomial theorem, we know that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is given by:\n   \\[\n   \\dbin"

    "text": " I remember that when dealing with expansions, the binomial theorem is really useful. I think I'll start by looking at each part separately and then see how they combine.\n\nFirst, let's consider the first part of the expression, which is \\((a + b)^4\\). I know that the binomial theorem tells us that \\((a + b)^n = \\sum_{k=0}^{n} \\dbinom{n}{k} a^{n - k}b^{k}\\). So, in this case, \\(n = 4\\). I need to find the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2 because the problem is asking for \\(a^2b^2\\). \n\nLet me write that out. The general term in the expansion would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^{k}\\). I want \\(a^2b^2\\), so I need \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). Let me check that: if \\(k = 2\\), then \\(4 - 2 = 2\\), so yes, that's the term. The coefficient here is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). I remember that \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient from the first part is 6.\n\nNow, moving on to the second part of the expression: \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I'm a bit confused here because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\). Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think: the expression is a product of two parts, so when we multiply them out, each term in the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), the terms involving \\(c\\) might not affect that coefficient. Hmm, is that right?\n\nWait, actually, the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, maybe I don't need to worry about the \\(c\\) terms when looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, perhaps the coefficient from the second part is 1, since we're just multiplying by 1 when considering the terms that don't involve \\(c\\). But that doesn't seem quite right because the second part is raised to the 6th power, which might contribute more. Wait, no, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the product of the coefficients from each part, and since we're only interested in the \\(a^2b^2\\) term, the other part can be any term from the second expansion, but since we're just looking for the coefficient, maybe it's just 1? Hmm, I'm a bit confused here.\n\nWait, no, that doesn't make sense. Let me think again. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). When we expand this, each term will be a product of a term from the first expansion and a term from the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part, because any term from the second part will multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. Wait, is that correct?\n\nWait, no, because the second part is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which expands to terms involving \\(c^k\\) and \\(1/c^k\\). But when we multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), the resulting term will have \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^k\\) or \\(1/c^k\\). But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, actually, we need to consider all the terms in the second expansion and sum their coefficients, because each term in the second expansion will contribute a coefficient when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\).\n\nWait, no, that's not quite right either. Because the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is actually the coefficient from the first part (\\(a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients from the second part \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, the coefficients add up. So, the total coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 (from the first part) multiplied by the sum of the coefficients in the second part.\n\nBut wait, the sum of the coefficients in the second part is found by setting \\(c = 1\\). Because when \\(c = 1\\), each term becomes its coefficient. So, \\(\\left(1 + 1/1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the sum of the coefficients in the second part is 64. So, the total coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. So, each term in the product is a term from the first expansion times a term from the second expansion. The terms in the first expansion are like \\(a^2b^2\\) with coefficient 6, and the terms in the second expansion are like \\(c^k\\) with coefficients \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}\\). So, when we multiply, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) would be 6 * \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}\\). But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, that would mean we need to sum over all \\(k\\) from 0 to 6, the coefficients 6 * \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}\\), which is 6 * (sum of \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}\\) from k=0 to 6). But the sum of binomial coefficients from k=0 to n is \\(2^n\\), so in this case, \\(2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the total coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me check if that's correct. Alternatively, maybe I can think of it as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6, and the second part, when multiplied, contributes a factor that is the sum of all its coefficients, which is 64, so the total coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of it as the entire expression being the product of two independent expansions, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just 6 (from the first part) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which is 64, giving 384.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not missing something. Is there a possibility that the second part affects the coefficient in a different way? For example, maybe I'm supposed to consider only the constant term in the second expansion, but that would be when \\(c^0\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, if I only take that term, then the coefficient would be 6 * 20 = 120. But the problem doesn't specify anything about \\(c\\), so I think it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in that case, I think the correct approach is to sum over all coefficients in the second part, giving 64, and then multiply by 6 to get 384.\n\nWait, but let me think again. When you have a product of two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum of the products of the coefficients of terms whose variables multiply to give that specific term. In this case, the specific term is \\(a^2b^2\\), and since the second polynomial doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), every term in the second polynomial will multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term, contributing their coefficients. So, the total coefficient would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial. That makes sense because each term in the second polynomial adds its coefficient when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\).\n\nSo, to confirm, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\(2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the total coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me check if that's correct. Let me compute the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). The sum of coefficients is when \\(c = 1\\), so \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\), which matches what I thought earlier.\n\nAlternatively, if I expand \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(1/c\\right)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, each term has a coefficient of \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}\\), and when \\(c = 1\\), each term is just \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}\\), so the sum is indeed 64.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit unsure because sometimes when dealing with variables, you might have to consider cross terms, but in this case, since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are only in the first part, and \\(c\\) is only in the second, the cross terms don't affect each other. So, I think my reasoning is correct.\n\nLet me recap: The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 64. Multiplying these together gives 384. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 384.\n\nI think that makes sense. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning, so I'll go with that.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is found using the binomial theorem: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). The sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(2^6 = 64\\). Multiplying these together gives \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\boxed{384}."

    "text": " \n\nFirst, I think I should break down the problem into smaller parts. The expression is a product of two binomials raised to different powers: \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that comes from expanding \\((a + b)^4\\). But wait, the entire expression also includes the other binomial with \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), so I need to consider how that part might affect things. \n\nWait, but actually, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the first part, right? Because the second part is in terms of \\(c\\), so when I multiply them together, the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms are only from the first binomial, and the \\(c\\) terms are from the second. So maybe the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, no, because when we multiply two expressions, each term from the first is multiplied by each term from the second. So actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all terms from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\). \n\nWait, no, that doesn't make sense. Because when you multiply, each term from the first expansion is multiplied by each term from the second. So if I'm looking for a term that's \\(a^2b^2\\) times something involving \\(c\\), but I think the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. Or maybe it's just the coefficient when considering the entire expression, but I'm not sure. Wait, actually, the problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", so maybe it's considering the entire expression, so the term would be \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by some combination from the second part, but since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term without \\(c\\), maybe I just need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, and then multiply it by the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Hmm, no, that might not be correct because each term in the product would be a combination of terms from both expansions. \n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think again. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product. So when I expand \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the product will be a product of a term from the first expansion and a term from the second. But since I'm only interested in the term where the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) parts are \\(a^2b^2\\), that term comes only from the first expansion. The second expansion doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) parts, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that can't be right because then the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\), but the problem is just asking for a numerical coefficient. \n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)\". So perhaps it's considering the entire product, and the term \\(a^2b^2\\) can be multiplied by any term from the second expansion. So the coefficient would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part. But no, that would be if we were combining like terms, but actually, each term in the product would be a combination of a term from the first expansion and a term from the second. So the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by each term from the second expansion, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the sum of all coefficients in the second part. But that doesn't make sense because the sum of coefficients in the second part is when \\(c = 1\\), so it's \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). \n\nWait, so maybe the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the coefficient from the first part times 64? Let me check that. \n\nFirst, let's find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\). Using the binomial theorem, the expansion is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^4 \\binom{4}{k} a^{4 - k} b^k\\). So when \\(k = 2\\), the term is \\(\\binom{4}{2} a^{2} b^{2}\\), so the coefficient is \\(\\binom{4}{2} = 6\\). \n\nNow, the second part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The sum of the coefficients in this expansion would be when \\(c = 1\\), so substituting \\(c = 1\\), we get \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). \n\nSo if I multiply the coefficient from the first part by 64, I get \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). \n\nWait, but that seems too straightforward. Let me think again. Is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product just 6 times 64? Or is there a different approach? \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I need to consider that when I multiply the two expansions, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by every term in the second part, which would result in \\(a^2b^2\\) times each term in the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the entire expansion of the second part. But that would mean that the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. \n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating it again. Let me think differently. Perhaps the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, so the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by each term from the second expansion, so the coefficient would be 6 times each term from the second expansion. But that would mean the coefficient is a sum over all terms in the second expansion, each multiplied by 6. But that seems odd because the problem is likely expecting a single numerical coefficient. \n\nWait, perhaps the problem is just considering the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, meaning that the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part, so the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 times 64, which is 384. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm supposed to consider that the entire expression is a product, and when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each polynomial. But in this case, since \\(a^2b^2\\) is only from the first polynomial, and the second polynomial contributes all its terms, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 6 times 64, which is 384. \n\nWait, but let me check that again. Let me think about it differently. If I have two polynomials, P(a, b) and Q(c), and I multiply them, then the coefficient of a term like \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in P(a, b) multiplied by the entire polynomial Q(c), because each term in P is multiplied by each term in Q. But since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve c, it's just \\(a^2b^2\\) times each term in Q(c). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in P(a, b) times the sum of all coefficients in Q(c), because each term in Q(c) contributes a coefficient when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). \n\nSo, the sum of all coefficients in Q(c) is when we set c = 1, so Q(1) = (1 + 1)^6 = 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nWait, that seems to make sense. Let me confirm by expanding a smaller example. Suppose I have (a + b)^2 * (c + 1/c)^1. The coefficient of a^2b^2 in (a + b)^2 is 1 (since it's a^2 + 2ab + b^2). The sum of coefficients in (c + 1/c)^1 is (1 + 1) = 2. So the coefficient of a^2b^2 in the product would be 1 * 2 = 2. If I actually expand (a + b)^2*(c + 1/c), the terms would be a^2c + a^2*(1/c) + 2ab*c + 2ab*(1/c) + b^2c + b^2*(1/c). The coefficient of a^2b^2 would be zero because there are no a^2b^2 terms. Wait, that contradicts my earlier conclusion. Hmm, so maybe my approach is wrong. \n\nWait, in this small example, the coefficient of a^2b^2 is zero because there are no a^2b^2 terms in the product. So my earlier approach must be incorrect. So perhaps I need a different method. \n\nWait, so maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, considering all possible terms, including those multiplied by \\(c\\) terms. But that would mean the term \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^k\\) for some k, but the problem is just asking for \\(a^2b^2\\), so perhaps it's considering the coefficient regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which would mean that the coefficient is just the coefficient from the first part, and the second part doesn't affect it. But that can't be right because when you multiply, each term from the first part is multiplied by each term from the second part. \n\nWait, perhaps I should think of it as the product being a polynomial in four variables: a, b, c, and 1/c. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would appear multiplied by various powers of c. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the c terms, which would mean that the coefficient is a polynomial in c. But the problem is probably expecting a numerical coefficient, so maybe I'm misunderstanding it. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, considering all terms, but only looking at the part that doesn't involve c. But that seems odd. \n\nWait, perhaps I should approach this differently. Let me consider that when we multiply the two expansions, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, which is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion multiplied by the entire second expansion. But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in c, which doesn't make sense. \n\nWait, maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some k, but it's just written as \\(a^2b^2\\). Hmm, no, the problem specifically says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\". So perhaps it's considering the coefficient as a polynomial in c, but the problem is just asking for the coefficient, so maybe it's 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems unlikely because the problem is probably expecting a numerical value. \n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me try to think of it as the product of two independent expansions. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because \\(c^0\\) would be the term that doesn't involve c, so when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), it would give a term that's just \\(a^2b^2\\). \n\nAh, that makes sense! So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion. Because when you multiply, you get terms like \\(a^2b^2 \\times c^0\\), which is just \\(a^2b^2\\). \n\nSo, let's compute each part. \n\nFirst, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\). Using the binomial theorem, this is \\(\\binom{4}{2} = 6\\). \n\nNext, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). To find this, we can consider the general term in the expansion, which is \\(\\binom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\binom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We want the exponent of c to be 0, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\). \n\nTherefore, the coefficient is \\(\\binom{6}{3} = 20\\). \n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). \n\nWait, that seems more reasonable. Let me check this with the small example I thought of earlier. \n\nIf I have \\((a + b)^2 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^1\\), then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 1, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part is the coefficient when \\(k = 0.5\\), but wait, that's not an integer. Wait, no, in this case, the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^1\\) is \\(c + 1/c\\), so the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is zero because there's no constant term. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 1 * 0 = 0, which matches my earlier observation when I expanded it. \n\nSo, applying this method, in the original problem, the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nWait, but earlier I thought it might be 384, but that was when I was considering the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, but that approach was incorrect because it would imply that \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, which isn't the case. Instead, the correct approach is to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion because that's the term that doesn't involve c, allowing \\(a^2b^2\\) to remain as a standalone term. \n\nTherefore, the correct coefficient is 120. \n\nI think that's the right approach. Let me just recap to make sure I didn't miss anything. \n\n1. The problem asks for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). \n\n2. When multiplying two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each polynomial. \n\n3. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first polynomial, and to get a term that doesn't involve c, we need the term with \\(c^0\\) from the second polynomial. \n\n4. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. \n\n5. The coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is found by setting the exponent equal to zero, which gives \\(k = 3\\), and the coefficient is \\(\\binom{6}{3} = 20\\). \n\n6. Multiplying these gives 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nYes, that seems correct. I think I was confused earlier by considering the sum of all coefficients, but that approach was wrong. The correct method is to find the term in the second expansion that doesn't involve c, which is the constant term, and then multiply it by the coefficient from the first expansion. \n\nSo, the final answer should be 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then finding the constant term (coefficient of \\(c^0\\)) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20. Multiplying these gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\boxed{120}."

    "text": " \n\nFirst, I remember that when you have an expression like \\((a + b)^n\\), you can expand it using the binomial theorem. The binomial theorem says that \\((a + b)^n = \\sum_{k=0}^{n} \\dbinom{n}{k} a^{n - k}b^k\\). So maybe I can apply that here.\n\nThe problem is asking specifically about the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So I think I need to find the term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) that has \\(a^2b^2\\). Let me write that down.\n\nFor \\((a + b)^4\\), using the binomial theorem, each term is \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\\). I need the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2. That would mean \\(4 - k = 2\\) for \\(a\\), so \\(k = 2\\). So the coefficient here is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\).\n\nLet me calculate that. \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), is 6. \n\nNow, the expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Hmm, I need to consider how this multiplication affects the term \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, actually, since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), the multiplication will just multiply the entire expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) by the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nBut wait, the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So maybe I don't need to worry about the \\(c\\) terms because they're separate variables. Or do I? Let me think.\n\nWait, no, actually, the entire expression is the product of two expansions, so when you multiply them, each term from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term from the second expansion. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), that means we just need to take the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part and multiply it by the entire expansion of the second part. But wait, that doesn't make sense because the second expansion has terms with \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), which aren't present in \\(a^2b^2\\). \n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Since the term \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), the only way it can appear in the product is if we take the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from \\((a + b)^4\\) and multiply it by the term that is a constant (i.e., doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\)) from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because if we multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by any term that has \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), it would result in a term that has both \\(a^2b^2\\) and some power of \\(c\\), which isn't what we're looking for. \n\nSo, to get the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and then multiply it by the coefficient of the constant term in the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nAlright, so now I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). How do I do that? Well, again, using the binomial theorem. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k\\). \n\nSimplifying each term, we get \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\cdot c^{-k} = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So each term has an exponent of \\(c\\) equal to \\(6 - 2k\\). \n\nWe need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero because that's the constant term. So we set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\) and solve for \\(k\\). \n\n\\(6 - 2k = 0\\)\n\nSubtract 6 from both sides: \\(-2k = -6\\)\n\nDivide both sides by -2: \\(k = 3\\)\n\nSo the constant term is when \\(k = 3\\). Let me compute that coefficient.\n\n\\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\)\n\nSo the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. \n\nNow, going back to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficient from the first part and the constant term from the second part. \n\nSo that would be \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nWait, let me just verify that. So in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, and in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the constant term is 20. So when we multiply these two parts, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by 20, so the coefficient becomes 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nIs there any other term I need to consider? I don't think so because any other term from the second expansion would have a power of \\(c\\), which isn't present in \\(a^2b^2\\). So I think 120 is the correct coefficient.\n\nWait, let me think again. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So when we expand both, each term from the first expansion is multiplied by each term from the second. So the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first expansion, and to get the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, we need to multiply it by the constant term from the second expansion because otherwise, we'd have \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2 \\times 1/c^k\\), which aren't just \\(a^2b^2\\). \n\nSo yes, only the constant term from the second expansion will contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So 6 * 20 is indeed 120. \n\nI think that makes sense. Let me check if there's another way to approach this. Maybe using multinomial coefficients? Wait, no, the problem is about binomial expansions, so I think the way I did it is correct.\n\nAlternatively, I could think of the entire expression as a product of two independent expansions and focus only on the terms that contribute to \\(a^2b^2\\). Since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) is to take \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part and the constant term from the second part. So yeah, I think that's the right approach.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120. I think that's the answer. Let me just recap:\n\n1. Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is 6.\n2. Expand \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem to find the constant term, which is 20.\n3. Multiply these two coefficients together: 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nSo the coefficient is 120. I don't think I made any mistakes here, but let me double-check the binomial coefficients just to be sure.\n\nFor \\((a + b)^4\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is when k=2, so \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). That's correct.\n\nFor \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the constant term is when the exponent of c is zero, which occurs at k=3, so \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). That's also correct.\n\nSo multiplying them gives 6 * 20 = 120. Yep, that seems right. I think I've got it.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is found by considering the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) and identifying the term with \\(a^2b^2\\), which has a coefficient of 6. Then, the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is calculated to be 20. Multiplying these coefficients together gives 6 * 20 = 120.\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}."

    "text": " I'm a bit confused because the expression has two parts multiplied together, each raised to different powers. I think I should handle each part separately and then see how they combine.\n\nFirst, I'll look at \\((a + b)^4\\). I remember that when you expand a binomial like \\((a + b)^n\\), you can use the binomial theorem, which states that each term is of the form \\(\\dbinom{n}{k} a^{n - k} b^k\\). So for \\((a + b)^4\\), the expansion will have terms where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) add up to 4.\n\nI specifically need the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So in this case, \\(n = 4\\), and I want the term where \\(a\\) is squared and \\(b\\) is squared. That means \\(k\\), which is the exponent of \\(b\\), should be 2. So using the binomial coefficient, that would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\).\n\nLet me calculate that: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. That part seems straightforward.\n\nNow, moving on to the second part: \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). This also looks like a binomial expansion, so I can apply the binomial theorem here as well. The expansion will have terms of the form \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\).\n\nLet me simplify that term. \\(\\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = c^{-m}\\), so the term becomes \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\times c^{-m} = \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\).\n\nWait, but in the original problem, we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). I'm a bit confused because the second part involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), which don't have \\(a\\) or \\(b\\) in them. So does that mean that when we multiply the two expansions together, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will just be multiplied by some combination from the second part, but since the second part doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), maybe it's just a constant factor?\n\nWait, no, that doesn't make sense. Let me think again. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product. So maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Since the second part doesn't have \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), when we multiply the two expansions, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part will just be multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. So the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the sum of all terms in the second part's expansion. But that doesn't seem right because that would make the coefficient a very large number, but I think I'm misunderstanding something.\n\nWait, maybe I'm supposed to consider the entire product and find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but since the second part has no \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), it's just a scalar multiple when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). So perhaps the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. But that doesn't make sense because the second part isn't a single term; it's a sum of terms with different powers of \\(c\\).\n\nWait, no, I think I'm getting confused. Let me clarify: when you have two expressions multiplied together, each term in the first expression is multiplied by each term in the second expression. But in this case, the first expression is \\((a + b)^4\\), which has terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the second expression is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which has terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So when you multiply them together, each term from the first will be multiplied by each term from the second.\n\nBut the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). That term in the first expression is \\(6a^2b^2\\), as I found earlier. Now, when I multiply this by the second expression, which is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in the second expression will multiply \\(6a^2b^2\\), resulting in terms like \\(6a^2b^2c^k\\) where \\(k\\) is the exponent from the second expansion.\n\nWait, but the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not any specific power of \\(c\\). That seems odd because in the product, each term would have \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by some power of \\(c\\). So perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). That is, summing over all possible powers of \\(c\\) in the second part.\n\nWait, that might make sense. So the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be \\(6\\) times the sum of all coefficients in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Because each term in the second expansion, when multiplied by \\(6a^2b^2\\), would contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times some power of \\(c\\), but if we're considering the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then we would sum all the coefficients from the second part.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, which would involve multiplying the coefficient from the first part by the entire second part, but that seems incorrect because the second part isn't a single term.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think again. The problem is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So when you expand this, each term in the expansion will be a product of a term from the first expansion and a term from the second expansion. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the first expansion, and when multiplied by any term from the second expansion, it will result in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2c^{-k}\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would include all such terms where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2 each, regardless of the exponent of \\(c\\).\n\nWait, that might be it. So the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion, because each term in the second expansion contributes a factor that, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), gives a term with \\(a^2b^2\\) times some power of \\(c\\). But if we're just looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then we need to sum all the coefficients from the second expansion and multiply by 6.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times a specific power of \\(c\\), but since it's not specified, I think it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), so we need to sum all the coefficients from the second expansion.\n\nWait, but that doesn't seem right because the second expansion has terms with different powers of \\(c\\), and each would contribute to a different term in the product. So maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\), which is 1. That would make more sense because then we're looking for a specific term where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out.\n\nHmm, that might be the case. Let me check that possibility. So if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then I need to find the term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0. Because when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), that would give \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is just \\(a^2b^2\\).\n\nSo let me work under that assumption. So first, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6, as I found earlier. Now, in the second part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), I need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0. Let me find that.\n\nUsing the binomial theorem, the general term in the expansion is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\times (1/c)^m = \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We want the exponent of \\(c\\) to be 0, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which gives \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\).\n\nSo the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0 is when \\(m = 3\\), and the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Let me calculate that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). So the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part is 20.\n\nNow, since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product, that would be the product of the coefficients from each part. So 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the second part) gives 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, so is the coefficient 120? Let me confirm that.\n\nSo, in summary:\n\n1. Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) and find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is 6.\n2. Expand \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) and find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\), which is 20.\n3. Multiply these two coefficients together to get 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product is 120.\n\nWait, but the original problem didn't specify the exponent of \\(c\\), just \\(a^2b^2\\). So perhaps I made an incorrect assumption by considering \\(c^0\\). Maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the exponent of \\(c\\). That would mean that the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part, which is a sum of terms with different powers of \\(c\\). But that would make the coefficient a sum, which doesn't make much sense because the problem is asking for a single coefficient.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of the power of \\(c\\), which would mean that each term in the second expansion contributes a coefficient that, when multiplied by 6, would give the total coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) times each corresponding power of \\(c\\). But if we're just looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without considering \\(c\\), then it's ambiguous. However, given that the problem includes both \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) and also \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), it's more likely that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\).\n\nSo, I think my initial approach was correct. The coefficient is 120.\n\nLet me just recap to make sure I didn't miss anything.\n\nFirst part: \\((a + b)^4\\). Coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6.\n\nSecond part: \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20.\n\nMultiply them together: 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nYes, that seems right. So the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 120.\n\nWait, but another thought: when you multiply the two expansions, each term from the first is multiplied by each term from the second. So the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part. So the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. But the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So 6 * 64 = 384. But that would be the coefficient if we were considering \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by all possible powers of \\(c\\). But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), that would be 384. But that contradicts my earlier conclusion of 120.\n\nWait, now I'm really confused. Which approach is correct?\n\nLet me clarify the question: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\"\n\nThe term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by each term from the second expansion, which includes different powers of \\(c\\). So the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for each \\(k\\) would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^k\\) in the second expansion. But if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then it's the sum over all \\(k\\) of the coefficients of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), which would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. The sum of all coefficients in the second expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nBut wait, that would mean the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\) is 384. But earlier, I thought it was 120 when considering \\(c^0\\). So which is it?\n\nI think the problem is ambiguous, but usually, when asked for the coefficient of a term like \\(a^2b^2\\) in a product involving other variables, it's referring to the coefficient when considering all possible powers of the other variables. So in this case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would indeed be 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nBut wait, that doesn't seem right because the problem is written as \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So the product is a polynomial in \\(a, b, c, 1/c\\). The term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by each term from the second expansion, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for various \\(k\\). So if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then it's the sum of all coefficients of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for all \\(k\\), which is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion.\n\nBut if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it's 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion, which is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nI think the problem is more likely asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), because otherwise, it would have specified that it's looking for the coefficient regardless of \\(c\\). But the problem didn't specify, so maybe I should consider both interpretations.\n\nWait, let me check the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\"\n\nIt just says \"coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", without mentioning \\(c\\). So in the context of the entire product, each term would be \\(a^kb^lc^m\\) where \\(k + l = 4\\) and \\(m\\) is determined by the second expansion. So the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the sum over all \\(m\\) of the coefficients of \\(a^2b^2c^m\\). But that's equivalent to 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nBut that seems too large, and I'm not sure if that's what the problem is asking for. Alternatively, maybe the problem is only considering the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and the second part is just a scalar multiple, but that doesn't make sense because the second part is an expansion with multiple terms.\n\nWait, no, that's not correct because the second part is multiplied by the first part, so each term in the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nBut let me think about it differently. Let me consider the entire product as a product of two polynomials. The first polynomial is in variables \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the second is in variables \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So when you multiply them, the variables are independent. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial multiplied by the entire second polynomial. But that doesn't make sense because the second polynomial isn't a scalar; it's a sum of terms involving \\(c\\).\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, but without specifying any particular power. So in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the entire second polynomial. But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try to think of it as a product of two polynomials. The first is \\(P(a, b) = (a + b)^4\\), and the second is \\(Q(c) = \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). The product is \\(P(a, b) \\times Q(c)\\). So when you expand this, each term in \\(P(a, b)\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(Q(c)\\). So the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(P(a, b)\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(Q(c)\\), resulting in terms like \\(6a^2b^2c^k\\) where \\(k\\) varies. So the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) in the product is 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^k\\) in \\(Q(c)\\).\n\nBut the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would include all possible powers of \\(c\\). So that would mean the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(Q(c)\\), because each term in \\(Q(c)\\) contributes a coefficient when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\).\n\nWait, but the sum of all coefficients in \\(Q(c)\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), so \\(Q(1) = (1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nBut earlier, I thought it was 120 when considering \\(c^0\\). So which is it?\n\nI think the confusion arises from whether the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), or specifically \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). Since the problem doesn't specify the exponent of \\(c\\), it's ambiguous, but in most cases, when variables other than those in the term are involved, the problem is asking for the coefficient regardless of those variables. So in this case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nBut let me check this again. If I consider the product \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion multiplied by the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion. Because when you multiply out the terms, \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, each contributing a different power of \\(c\\). So the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it's 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion, which is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nBut the problem didn't specify the exponent of \\(c\\), so I'm torn between these two interpretations.\n\nWait, perhaps I should look for the term \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms, meaning \\(c^0\\). That would make sense because otherwise, the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense as a numerical coefficient. So maybe the intended answer is 120.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is structured such that the second part's expansion doesn't affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but that doesn't make sense because the second part is being multiplied by the first part.\n\nWait, let me think of it as a product of two independent polynomials. So the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial multiplied by the entire second polynomial. But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which is not a numerical coefficient. Therefore, the only way the coefficient can be a single number is if we're considering the term where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out, i.e., \\(c^0\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is 120.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So I think the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nLet me just confirm this by considering a simpler case. Suppose we have \\((a + b)^1 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, the expansion would be:\n\n\\((a + b)(c + 1/c) = ac + a/c + bc + b/c\\).\n\nNow, the coefficient of \\(a\\) in this product would be \\(c + 1/c\\), but if we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a\\) times \\(c^0\\), then it's 1. So in this case, the coefficient of \\(a c^0\\) would be 1, which is the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion multiplied by the coefficient of \\(a\\) in the first expansion.\n\nSimilarly, in our problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) would be the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion multiplied by the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion, which is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nTherefore, I think the correct answer is 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break the problem into two parts and then combine the results.\n\n1. **Expanding \\((a + b)^4\\):**\n   Using the binomial theorem, the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is given by:\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4-k} b^k\n   \\]\n   We need the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which corresponds to \\(k = 2\\):\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\n   \\]\n   So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\n2. **Expanding \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   Using the binomial theorem, the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is given by:\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6-2m}\n   \\]\n   We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, which occurs when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(m = 3\\):\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\n   \\]\n   So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20.\n\n3. **Combining the results:**\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is the product of the coefficients from each part:\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 20 = 120\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}."

    "text": " I'm a bit nervous because it involves expanding binomials, but I think I can handle it if I break it down.\n\nFirst, I know that when you have an expression like \\((a + b)^n\\), you can expand it using the binomial theorem. The binomial theorem says that \\((a + b)^n = \\sum_{k=0}^{n} \\dbinom{n}{k} a^{n - k}b^{k}\\). So, for \\((a + b)^4\\), I can write it out as:\n\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\dbinom{4}{0}a^4b^0 + \\dbinom{4}{1}a^3b^1 + \\dbinom{4}{2}a^2b^2 + \\dbinom{4}{3}a^1b^3 + \\dbinom{4}{4}a^0b^4\n\\]\n\nCalculating the coefficients, that would be:\n\n\\[\n1 \\cdot a^4 + 4 \\cdot a^3b + 6 \\cdot a^2b^2 + 4 \\cdot ab^3 + 1 \\cdot b^4\n\\]\n\nSo, looking at this, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. That part seems straightforward.\n\nNow, the other part of the expression is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I need to figure out how this part affects the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, but \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), right? So, does that mean that when I multiply these two expansions together, the terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) won't affect the \\(a^2b^2\\) term? Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating it.\n\nWait, let me think again. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, which is the product of \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when I multiply these two expressions, each term from the first expansion will multiply each term from the second expansion. But since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are different variables, the only way the product will have \\(a^2b^2\\) is if we take the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part and multiply it by any term from the second part. However, since the second part doesn't have any \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product will just be the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nWait, no, that doesn't make sense because the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would actually be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but since we're only interested in the coefficient, maybe I can think of it differently.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Let me try to clarify. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the \\((a + b)^4\\) part, and when I multiply it by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in that expansion will contribute a factor. But since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), when I multiply it by any term from the second expansion, it will just add a multiple of \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\) to it. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, which would include all possible terms. But actually, no, because \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), so when multiplied by any term from the second expansion, it would become \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by \\(c^k\\) or \\(c^{-k}\\) for some \\(k\\). Therefore, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) itself would have a coefficient that's the sum of all the coefficients from the second expansion, because each term in the second expansion would multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term, contributing their coefficients.\n\nWait, that seems a bit confusing. Let me try to approach it differently. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, each term contributes a coefficient, and since \\(a^2b^2\\) is independent of \\(c\\), the total coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) across all terms would be the coefficient from the first part times the sum of coefficients from the second part.\n\nSo, the coefficient from the first part is 6, as I found earlier. Now, I need to find the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). To find the sum of coefficients in a polynomial, you can substitute \\(c = 1\\). Let me check that.\n\nIf I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = (2)^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 64.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 64 (sum of coefficients from the second part), which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. Is the sum of coefficients in the second part really 64? Because when \\(c = 1\\), it's indeed 2^6 = 64, so that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of it as the product of two independent expansions. Since the variables are different, the coefficients would multiply. So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6, and the coefficient for \\(c^0\\) (the constant term) in the second part would contribute to the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, because \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\). Wait, but that might not be the case. Let me think again.\n\nWait, perhaps I was wrong earlier. Maybe the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is only affected by the terms in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) that have \\(c^0\\), because otherwise, the term would have a power of \\(c\\), and since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't have any \\(c\\), the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is by multiplying \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part by \\(c^0\\) from the second part. Therefore, the coefficient would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nHmm, that makes more sense. So, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let's calculate that.\n\nUsing the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\).\n\nWe want the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\).\n\nTherefore, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the second part), which is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, so earlier I thought it was 384, but now I'm getting 120. Which one is correct?\n\nI think I made a mistake in the first approach. Let me re-examine. The key here is that when you multiply two expressions, the terms combine in such a way that each term from the first expression is multiplied by each term from the second. But when looking for a specific term like \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), we need to consider only the terms in the second expression that don't involve \\(c\\), i.e., the constant term. Because if you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by a term involving \\(c^k\\), you get \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), which is a different term, not just \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is by multiplying \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part by the constant term \\(c^0\\) from the second part. So, the coefficient should indeed be 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nTherefore, my initial approach where I multiplied by the sum of all coefficients (64) was incorrect because that would include all powers of \\(c\\), leading to terms that have \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), which are not just \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the correct approach is to only consider the constant term from the second expansion, which is 20.\n\nSo, putting it all together:\n\n1. Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6.\n2. Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem. The coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20.\n3. Multiply these coefficients together: 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120.\n\nWait, just to make sure, let me double-check the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). The general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\cdot (1/c)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, when is the exponent 0? When \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which is when \\(k = 3\\). So, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Yep, that's correct.\n\nAnd in the first expansion, \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6. So, 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nI think that's solid. So, the answer should be 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) can be found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then finding the constant term (coefficient of \\(c^0\\)) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20. Multiplying these together gives 6 * 20 = 120.\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\boxed{120}."

    "text": " \n\nFirst, I remember that when you have an expression raised to a power like \\((a + b)^n\\), you can use the binomial theorem to expand it. The binomial theorem says that \\((a + b)^n = \\sum_{k=0}^{n} \\dbinom{n}{k} a^{n - k} b^k\\). So, maybe I can apply that here.\n\nThe problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). That means I need to find the term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) where \\(a\\) is squared and \\(b\\) is also squared. Let me write that down.\n\nSo, for \\((a + b)^4\\), using the binomial theorem, the general term is \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k} b^k\\). I need the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2. That would mean \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). So, substituting \\(k = 2\\) into the binomial coefficient, we get \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\).\n\nCalculating that, \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\nWait, but the original expression isn't just \\((a + b)^4\\); it's multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Hmm, so does that affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)? Let me think.\n\nI think it's important to note that \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\), and \\(1/c\\) are all variables, and when we multiply two expressions together, the variables from each part multiply as well. However, the problem is specifically asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). That means we're looking for the term where \\(a\\) is squared, \\(b\\) is squared, and the other variables (c and 1/c) can be anything, but we're only concerned with the coefficient part related to \\(a^2b^2\\).\n\nWait, actually, no. Let me correct that. When we multiply two expressions, each term in the first expression multiplies each term in the second expression. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by every term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), right? Because \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't have any \\(c\\) in it. So, does that mean the coefficient will just be 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\n\nWait, that doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). But if \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term in the first part, and when we multiply by the second part, each term in the second part will be multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), so \\(a^2b^2\\) will be a coefficient for each of those terms, but I'm not sure. Maybe I'm overcomplicating it.\n\nLet me think differently. Maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, regardless of the other variables. But since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient would just be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems like the entire expression would have a term \\(6a^2b^2\\) multiplied by all the terms from the second part, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be \\(6\\) times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nWait, but that might not be correct because when you multiply two expressions, the coefficients multiply. Hmm, no, actually, when you have two polynomials multiplied together, each term from the first polynomial is multiplied by each term from the second polynomial. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the sum of all the coefficients in the second part.\n\nBut wait, is that true? Let me think. Suppose I have \\( (a + b)^4 \\times (c + 1/c)^6 \\). So, when I expand this, I get a sum of terms like \\( \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k} b^k \\times \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} (1/c)^m \\). So, each term is \\( \\dbinom{4}{k} \\dbinom{6}{m} a^{4 - k} b^k c^{6 - 2m} \\).\n\nNow, I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). That means I need \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). So, \\(k = 2\\). Then, the coefficient from the first part is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Now, for the second part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, when I multiply the two, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), does that mean that the coefficient is just 6 times the entire expansion of the second part? That can't be right because the expansion includes terms with different powers of \\(c\\).\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the question. It says, \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\" in the entire product. But \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term without any \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\). So, actually, in the product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by the constant term (the term with \\(c^0\\)) from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Because if I have \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), that's just \\(a^2b^2\\). Any other term would have \\(c\\) raised to some power, so it wouldn't be just \\(a^2b^2\\).\n\nSo, that means I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and then multiply it by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Then, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part.\n\nSo, now I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Let me think about how to do that.\n\nAgain, using the binomial theorem, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(1/c\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\).\n\nWe need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be 0, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\).\n\nCalculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). Wait, that seems off because \\(6! = 720\\), but \\(3! = 6\\), so \\(720/(6 \\times 6) = 720/36 = 20\\). Yeah, that's correct.\n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Therefore, going back to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nWait, let me just double-check that. So, in the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. In the second part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. When we multiply these two parts together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by 20, so the coefficient becomes 6 * 20 = 120. That makes sense.\n\nI think that's the answer. But let me just make sure I didn't miss anything. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), so it's just the product of the coefficients from each part where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out. So, yeah, 6 * 20 = 120. I think that's correct.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break down the problem into two parts using the binomial theorem.\n\nFirst, consider the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\). Using the binomial theorem, the general term is given by:\n\\[\n\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k} b^k\n\\]\nWe need the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2. This corresponds to \\(k = 2\\). The coefficient is:\n\\[\n\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\n\\]\n\nNext, consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem, the general term is given by:\n\\[\n\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n\\]\nWe need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0. This corresponds to \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which gives \\(m = 3\\). The coefficient is:\n\\[\n\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\n\\]\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the product of the coefficients from each part:\n\\[\n6 \\times 20 = 120\n\\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

It says, \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, maybe they just want the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). That is, treat \\(c\\) as another variable, but since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).

Let me think differently. Since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term in the first part, and the second part is multiplied by it, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire second part. But that would mean the coefficient is \\(6 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial in \\(c\\), not a constant.

That would make sense because then the coefficient would be a number. So, maybe I need to consider both expansions and find the term where \\(a^2b^2c^0\\).\n\nLet me try that approach. So, first, from \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, as I found earlier. Now, from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), I need the coefficient of \\(c^0\\), because when I multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by \\(c^0\\), the exponent of \\(c\\) will be 0, which is what I want.\n\nSo, let me find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem again, the expansion is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\).\n\nI need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20.\n\nNow, since the original expression is the product of \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is the product of the coefficients from each part. That is, 6 (from \\(a^2b^2\\)) multiplied by 20 (from \\(c^0\\)), which gives 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, that makes sense. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120, considering that we're looking for the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2 and 2, and the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0. \n\nLet me just double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake. \n\n1. Found the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n2. Then, considered the second part \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) and found the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) by solving \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gave \\(k = 3\\), and the binomial coefficient \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n3. Multiplied the two coefficients together: 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nYes, that seems correct. I don't think I made any calculation errors. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break down the problem into two parts using the binomial theorem.\n\n1. **Finding the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\):**\n   Using the binomial theorem, the general term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is given by:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k} b^k\n   \\]\n   We need the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2.

    "text": " I'm a bit confused because the expression has two parts multiplied together: one involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the other involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). But the term I'm interested in is \\(a^2b^2\\), which only has \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), so maybe the part with \\(c\\) doesn't affect this term? Or does it? I'm not sure yet.\n\nFirst, I'll focus on the \\((a + b)^4\\) part because that's where the \\(a^2b^2\\) term comes from. I remember that when you expand a binomial like \\((a + b)^n\\), you can use the binomial theorem, which says that each term is of the form \\(\\dbinom{n}{k} a^{n - k}b^k\\) for \\(k\\) from 0 to \\(n\\). So in this case, \\(n = 4\\), and I'm looking for the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2, which would be when \\(k = 2\\).\n\nLet me write that out. The general term is \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\\). So when \\(k = 2\\), the term is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} a^{2}b^{2}\\). I can compute \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) as \\(\\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. That part seems straightforward.\n\nNow, the other part of the expression is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I'm not sure how this affects the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), maybe the coefficients from the \\(c\\) terms just multiply the coefficients from the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms? But wait, I'm only asked about the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so perhaps I don't need to consider the \\(c\\) terms at all? That seems a bit odd. Let me think again.\n\nWait, no, actually, the entire expression is a product of two expansions: \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So when you multiply them together, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But since I'm only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I need to consider all the ways that \\(a^2b^2\\) can be multiplied by terms from the second expansion. However, since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), any term from the second expansion that has a \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\) would result in a term that includes \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), which isn't part of \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the only term from the second expansion that would multiply with \\(a^2b^2\\) without introducing \\(c\\) is the constant term, i.e., the term where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out. So I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nOkay, so I'll work on that now. Let's consider \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Again, using the binomial theorem, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k\\), which simplifies to \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So the exponent of \\(c\\) in each term is \\(6 - 2k\\). I need to find the term where the exponent is zero because that's the constant term. So I set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\).\n\nTherefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} c^{0} = \\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Computing that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). So the constant term is 20.\n\nNow, going back to the original expression, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and the only term from the second expansion that doesn't introduce any \\(c\\) is the constant term 20, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficients from each part. So that would be 6 (from the \\(a^2b^2\\) term) multiplied by 20 (the constant term from the \\(c\\) expansion).\n\nSo, 6 times 20 is 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120.\n\nWait a second, let me make sure I didn't miss anything. Is there any other term in the second expansion that could contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)? For example, could a term with \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) somehow combine with a term from the first expansion to give \\(a^2b^2\\)? But no, because \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), so any term involving \\(c\\) would introduce a factor of \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), which wouldn't be present in \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, only the constant term from the second expansion contributes to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product.\n\nSo, yeah, I think I'm confident that the coefficient is 120. Let me just recap:\n\n1. Find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6.\n2. Find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20.\n3. Multiply these two coefficients together: 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break the problem into two parts.\n\nFirst, consider the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem. The term involving \\(a^2b^2\\) is given by:\n\\[\n\\binom{4}{2} a^2 b^2\n\\]\nCalculating the binomial coefficient:\n\\[\n\\binom{4}{2} = \\frac{4!}{2!2!} = \\frac{24}{4} = 6\n\\]\nSo, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\nNext, consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). We need the constant term (the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero). Using the binomial theorem, each term is:\n\\[\n\\binom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\binom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n\\]\nSetting the exponent of \\(c\\) to zero:\n\\[\n6 - 2k = 0 \\implies k = 3\n\\]\nThe constant term is:\n\\[\n\\binom{6}{3} = \\frac{6!}{3!3!} = \\frac{720}{36} = 20\n\\]\n\nFinally, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficients from each part:\n\\[\n6 \\times 20 = 120\n\\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

    "text": " I'm a bit rusty on binomial expansions, but I think I can work through it.\n\nFirst, I remember that when you have an expression like \\((a + b)^n\\), you can expand it using the binomial theorem. The binomial theorem says that each term in the expansion is of the form \\(\\dbinom{n}{k}a^{n - k}b^{k}\\), right? So, for \\((a + b)^4\\), each term will be \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}a^{4 - k}b^{k}\\) where \\(k\\) goes from 0 to 4.\n\nNow, the problem is asking specifically for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, I need to find the term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2. That means \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). So, the coefficient would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\).\n\nLet me calculate that: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. But wait, the expression isn't just \\((a + b)^4\\); it's multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I can't stop here; I need to consider how this multiplication affects the coefficient.\n\nI think the next step is to consider the entire expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Since these two parts are multiplied together, the terms from each expansion will multiply term by term. However, the problem is only asking about the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which only comes from the \\((a + b)^4\\) part. The \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) part doesn't affect the powers of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), right? It only affects the powers of \\(c\\). So, does that mean the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just 6, regardless of the other terms?\n\nWait, maybe I should think about it more carefully. Let me consider how the two expansions interact. When I multiply two polynomials, each term from the first polynomial is multiplied by each term from the second polynomial. But in this case, the first polynomial is in terms of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the second is in terms of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). Since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\), and \\(1/c\\) are all different variables, their exponents don't interfere with each other. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, no, that doesn't quite make sense because when you multiply, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second. However, the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, actually, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems complicated. Maybe I'm overcomplicating it.\n\nWait, no, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. Let me clarify: when we multiply two expressions, each term from the first is multiplied by each term from the second. So, if I have \\( (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^4 \\dbinom{4}{k}a^{4 - k}b^{k} \\) and \\( \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^6 \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - m}\\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m \\). So, when I multiply these together, I get a double sum: \\( \\sum_{k=0}^4 \\sum_{m=0}^6 \\dbinom{4}{k}\\dbinom{6}{m}a^{4 - k}b^{k}c^{6 - m - m} \\).\n\nBut the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, in the first part, \\(a^{4 - k}b^{k}\\), we want \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). So, as before, \\(k = 2\\) and the coefficient from the first part is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Now, the second part, \\(c^{6 - 2m}\\), can be anything because the problem isn't specifying any particular power of \\(c\\). It's just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, that means we need to sum over all possible \\(m\\) from 0 to 6, each multiplied by their respective coefficients.\n\nWait, but that doesn't seem right. Let me think again. If I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term in the product, it would be the sum of all products of coefficients where the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) parts give \\(a^2b^2\\), and the \\(c\\) parts can be anything. But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then yes, I think I need to sum over all possible \\(m\\) from 0 to 6, each multiplied by \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\). So, the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the sum of \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\) for \\(m\\) from 0 to 6.\n\nWait, but the sum of \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\) from \\(m = 0\\) to \\(6\\) is \\(2^6 = 64\\). So, is the coefficient 6 * 64 = 384? That seems high. Let me check.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), so it's just the coefficient from the first part times the entire second part. But that would mean the coefficient is 6 multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that's not a number, it's an expression. So, that can't be right.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question. Maybe it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, considering all possible powers of \\(c\\). But the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would appear in the product as \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by every possible term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which has terms like \\(c^6\\), \\(c^4\\), ..., \\(c^0\\), \\(c^{-2}\\), \\(c^{-4}\\), \\(c^{-6}\\). So, each of these would be multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), but the coefficient for each of these would be 6 times the corresponding binomial coefficient. But the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, actually, the coefficient is 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But the sum of coefficients in a polynomial is found by setting all variables to 1. So, if I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of the coefficients is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me think again. When you have \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the other part is in \\(c\\), the coefficient would indeed be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but that seems too straightforward. Let me verify with a simpler example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^2 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^1\\). Then, the expansion would be \\((a^2 + 2ab + b^2)(c + 1/c)\\). The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be zero because there's no \\(a^2b^2\\) term. Wait, that doesn't make sense because in this case, the highest power of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) is 1 each. So, maybe my approach is wrong.\n\nWait, no, in this example, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is zero because you can't get \\(a^2b^2\\) from \\((a + b)^2\\). So, in the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the sum of coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. But in the smaller example, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be zero, which makes sense because \\((a + b)^2\\) only has up to \\(a^2\\) and \\(b^2\\), but when multiplied by \\((c + 1/c)\\), the \\(a^2b^2\\) term would require multiplying \\(a^2\\) by \\(1/c\\) and \\(b^2\\) by \\(c\\), but that would give \\(a^2b^2c^{-1}\\) and \\(a^2b^2c\\), not \\(a^2b^2\\) alone. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\) is zero in that case because you can't have \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms. Wait, no, that's not right because in the original problem, the question is about the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, in the smaller example, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be zero because \\((a + b)^2\\) only has \\(a^2\\), \\(2ab\\), and \\(b^2\\), and when multiplied by \\((c + 1/c)\\), the \\(a^2\\) term would give \\(a^2c\\) and \\(a^2/c\\), the \\(2ab\\) term would give \\(2abc\\) and \\(2ab/c\\), and the \\(b^2\\) term would give \\(b^2c\\) and \\(b^2/c\\). So, there is no \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the product, hence the coefficient is zero.\n\nWait, so maybe in the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is not just 6 times the sum of coefficients in the second expansion. Because in the smaller example, the coefficient is zero, but according to my previous logic, it would be 1 (from \\((a + b)^2\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is zero, but the sum of coefficients in the second expansion is 2, so 0 * 2 = 0, which is correct. So, maybe my approach is correct.\n\nWait, in the original problem, \\((a + b)^4\\) has a term \\(a^2b^2\\) with coefficient 6. The second expansion, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), when expanded, has terms like \\(c^6\\), \\(6c^4\\), \\(15c^2\\), \\(20\\), \\(15c^{-2}\\), \\(6c^{-4}\\), \\(c^{-6}\\). So, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product will be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, because each term in the second expansion is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). But the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but in the smaller example, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is zero because there's no \\(a^2b^2\\) term. But according to my logic, the coefficient would be 1 (from \\((a + b)^2\\), which has a term \\(a^2\\) with coefficient 1, but actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is zero because you can't get \\(a^2b^2\\) from \\((a + b)^2\\). So, perhaps my approach is incorrect because in the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is only present if the first expansion has that term, which it does, but in the smaller example, the first expansion doesn't have \\(a^2b^2\\), so the coefficient is zero.\n\nWait, no, in the original problem, the first expansion does have \\(a^2b^2\\), so the coefficient is 6 times the sum of coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, giving 384. But in the smaller example, the first expansion doesn't have \\(a^2b^2\\), so the coefficient is zero, which is correct. So, maybe my approach is correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Maybe the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, that would mean that for each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), it contributes to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. So, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me think differently. Maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^k\\) for some \\(k\\), but the problem doesn't specify \\(k\\), so it's just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\). So, in that case, it's 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is miswritten, and it's supposed to ask for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) or something like that. But assuming it's just \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\), then the coefficient is 384.\n\nWait, but let me check with another example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^2 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^1\\). The expansion is \\((a^2 + 2ab + b^2)(c + 1/c)\\). The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be zero because there's no \\(a^2b^2\\) term. But according to my previous logic, the coefficient would be 1 (from \\(a^2\\)) times the sum of coefficients in the second expansion, which is 2, so 1 * 2 = 2, but that's not correct because the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is zero. So, my approach must be wrong.\n\nWait, but in this case, the first expansion doesn't have an \\(a^2b^2\\) term, so the coefficient is zero, which is correct. So, in the original problem, since the first expansion does have an \\(a^2b^2\\) term, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, giving 384.\n\nWait, but in the smaller example, if I have \\((a + b)^2 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^1\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is zero, which is correct. So, maybe my approach is correct.\n\nWait, but let me think again. When I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, each term in the second expansion contributes to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times some power of \\(c\\). But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, giving 384.\n\nWait, but in the smaller example, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is zero because the first expansion doesn't have that term. So, in the original problem, since the first expansion does have \\(a^2b^2\\), the coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), i.e., the constant term in \\(c\\). That would make more sense. Let me check that.\n\nIf the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), and then multiply them together.\n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, as before. The coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is the middle term, which is when the exponent is zero. The general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, setting \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), we get \\(m = 3\\). So, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nBut the problem didn't specify \\(c^0\\), it just said \\(a^2b^2\\). So, perhaps the problem is indeed asking for the coefficient regardless of the power of \\(c\\), which would be 384. But in that case, the answer would be 384, but I'm not sure if that's what the problem is asking for.\n\nWait, let me read the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, it's just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nBut in the smaller example, that approach gave the correct result (zero), so maybe it's correct here.\n\nWait, but let me think differently. Maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\). That would make sense because otherwise, the coefficient would be a sum over all powers of \\(c\\), which seems unusual to ask for. So, perhaps I misinterpreted the problem.\n\nIf that's the case, then I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\).\n\nAs before, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nBut the problem didn't specify \\(c^0\\), so I'm confused. Let me check the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, it's just \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nBut I'm not entirely sure. Maybe I should look up similar problems or think about how the coefficients work when multiplying two polynomials.\n\nWait, when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second, and the coefficients add up when the variables match. But in this case, the variables are different: \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\). So, the only way \\(a^2b^2\\) appears in the product is when you take the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first polynomial and multiply it by every term from the second polynomial. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is indeed the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me think about this again. If I have two polynomials, one in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the other in \\(c\\), then when I multiply them, the variables are independent. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial times the entire second polynomial. But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 64, giving 384.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So, I think the answer is 384.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought maybe it's 120 if it's asking for \\(c^0\\), but since the problem didn't specify, I think it's 384.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is written incorrectly, and it's supposed to ask for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be 120. But without that specification, I think 384 is the correct answer.\n\nWait, but let me think about the problem again. If I have \\((a + b)^4\\), which expands to terms with \\(a^4\\), \\(a^3b\\), \\(a^2b^2\\), \\(ab^3\\), \\(b^4\\), each multiplied by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which has terms like \\(c^6\\), \\(c^4\\), ..., \\(c^{-6}\\). So, when I multiply, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), etc. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the sum of all these coefficients, which is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, so 384.\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 384.\n\nWait, but let me check with another approach. Let me consider that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the entire second expansion is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^6 \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, when I multiply these, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the sum of \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\) for \\(m = 0\\) to 6, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nYes, that seems consistent.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can think of the entire product as a polynomial in \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\), and \\(1/c\\). The term \\(a^2b^2\\) will have coefficients multiplied by every possible power of \\(c\\), but since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\), it's just 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 64, so 384.\n\nTherefore, after all this thinking, I believe the coefficient is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Next, we consider the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), whose sum of coefficients is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), yielding \\(2^6 = 64\\). Multiplying these results gives the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) as \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\(\\boxed{384}\\)."

    "text": " I'm a bit confused because there are two different variables here, \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\), but I think I can handle it by breaking it down into parts.\n\nFirst, I remember that when expanding expressions like \\((a + b)^n\\), we can use the binomial theorem. The binomial theorem says that \\((a + b)^n = \\sum_{k=0}^{n} \\dbinom{n}{k} a^{n - k} b^k\\). So maybe I can apply that here for the \\((a + b)^4\\) part.\n\nLet me write that out. For \\((a + b)^4\\), using the binomial theorem, each term will be \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k} b^k\\) where \\(k\\) goes from 0 to 4. So the expansion will have terms like \\(a^4\\), \\(4a^3b\\), \\(6a^2b^2\\), \\(4ab^3\\), and \\(b^4\\). So the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) here is 6. That part seems straightforward.\n\nNow, the other part of the expression is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I also think I can use the binomial theorem for this part as well. Let me write that out. So, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying that, each term becomes \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m} = \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\).\n\nSo, the exponents of \\(c\\) in each term will be \\(6 - 2m\\), where \\(m\\) goes from 0 to 6. That means the exponents will be 6, 4, 2, 0, -2, -4, -6 for \\(m = 0\\) to \\(6\\) respectively. Hmm, but wait, do I need to worry about the exponent of \\(c\\)? The problem is only asking about the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\). So maybe the value of \\(c\\) doesn't matter as long as we're considering the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero because \\(c^0 = 1\\), which is a constant.\n\nWait, but actually, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so maybe I need to consider all possible terms in the product where \\(a^2b^2\\) appears, regardless of the power of \\(c\\). But no, I think the problem is just looking for the coefficient when \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by some term from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but since \\(c\\) is separate, maybe the coefficient is just 6 times the sum of all the coefficients from the other expansion. Wait, no, that doesn't make sense because each term in the product will be a combination of a term from \\((a + b)^4\\) and a term from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\).\n\nWait, but actually, when we multiply two expressions together, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression. So if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), that term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is \\(6a^2b^2\\). Now, when I multiply this by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the result will be \\(6a^2b^2\\) times each term in the second expansion. But the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, does that mean I just need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and then multiply it by the entire expansion of the second part? That can't be right because then the coefficient would be a sum of terms involving \\(c\\), but the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, not involving \\(c\\).\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that only involves \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), not \\(c\\). So when we multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will come from multiplying the \\(6a^2b^2\\) term in \\((a + b)^4\\) by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But since the problem is only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), that means we can treat the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) as a single term, because when we multiply \\(6a^2b^2\\) by the entire second expression, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) will be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. Wait, no, that doesn't make sense because each term in the second expansion has a different power of \\(c\\), so when we multiply, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) will be \\(6 \\times\\) the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, because each term in the second expansion is a coefficient times some power of \\(c\\), but when we multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), the \\(c\\) part just tags along, but the coefficient is 6 times whatever the coefficient in the second expansion is.\n\nWait, no, that's not quite right. Because in the product, each term will be of the form \\(6a^2b^2 \\times \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\), so the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^{6 - 2m}\\) is \\(6 \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}\\). But the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, actually, the coefficient is 6 multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients in the second expansion. Wait, but that can't be because the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion is when \\(c = 1\\), which would be \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). So, if I take 6 times 64, that would be 384. But is that correct?\n\nWait, let me verify. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the sum over all m of [coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in first part times coefficient of term in second part]. But since the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6, and each term in the second part is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\), so when we multiply, each term is 6 * \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\) times \\(c^{6 - 2m}\\). But the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so that would be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in the second expansion. The sum of the coefficients in the second expansion is indeed when \\(c = 1\\), which is \\(2^6 = 64\\). So, 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but that seems high. Let me think again. Alternatively, maybe I'm supposed to consider that the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product comes only from the term where the power of \\(c\\) is zero. But no, the problem didn't specify any condition on \\(c\\), just that it's part of the product. So, actually, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is present in the product for each power of \\(c\\), but the coefficient would be 6 times each coefficient from the second expansion. So, the total coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) across all powers of \\(c\\) would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but I'm not sure if that's the case. Let me check with a smaller example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^1 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, expanding, we have \\((a + b)(c + 1/c)\\). The coefficient of \\(a^1b^0\\) would be 1 times the sum of coefficients in the second expansion, which is 2, so 1 * 2 = 2. Similarly, the coefficient of \\(a^0b^1\\) would also be 1 * 2 = 2. But if I look at the expanded form, it's \\(ac + a/c + bc + b/c\\). So, the coefficients of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are indeed 2 each, which matches 1 * 2. So, in that case, it works.\n\nSimilarly, if I take \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^2\\), then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^0\\) would be \\(\\dbinom{2}{0} = 1\\) times the sum of coefficients in the second expansion, which is \\(2^2 = 4\\), so 1 * 4 = 4. Let me check: \\((a + b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2\\), and \\((c + 1/c)^2 = c^2 + 2 + 1/c^2\\). So, the product would have terms like \\(a^2c^2 + 2a^2 + a^2/c^2 + 2abc^2 + 4ab + 2ab/c^2 + b^2c^2 + 2b^2 + b^2/c^2\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) is indeed 1 * (1 + 2 + 1) = 4, which matches. Similarly, the coefficient of \\(ab\\) is 2 * (1 + 2 + 1) = 8, which is correct. So, this seems to hold.\n\nTherefore, in the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\times (c + 1/c)^6\\) would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which is \\(2^6 = 64\\). So, 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not missing something. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but in the product, each term is a combination of a term from the first expansion and a term from the second expansion. So, for example, \\(a^2b^2\\) could be multiplied by \\(c^6\\), \\(c^4\\), etc. But the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would indeed be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of it as the product of the two expansions. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion is 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) (i.e., the constant term) in the second expansion is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\) because when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), \\(m = 3\\). So, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\) would be 6 * 20 = 120. But wait, the problem didn't specify any condition on \\(c\\), so maybe I was wrong earlier. Maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), meaning that we have to consider all possible powers of \\(c\\). So, that would mean the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nBut now I'm confused because I have two different answers depending on whether I consider only the constant term or all terms. Let me go back to the problem statement: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" It doesn't specify anything about \\(c\\), so I think it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, that would mean that each term in the product where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present, regardless of the power of \\(c\\), contributes to the coefficient. So, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nBut wait, let me think again. If I consider the entire product, each term is a product of a term from the first expansion and a term from the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, which has coefficients \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\) for \\(m = 0\\) to \\(6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be 6 times the sum of \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\) for \\(m = 0\\) to \\(6\\). But the sum of \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\) from \\(m = 0\\) to \\(6\\) is \\(2^6 = 64\\), so 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but that seems correct. Alternatively, if I wanted the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some specific \\(k\\), that would be different, but since the problem is just asking for \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\), it's 384.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of it as the product of the two polynomials, and the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the product of the coefficients from each part. But no, that's not quite right because each term in the product is a combination of a term from each polynomial. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial. So, 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me check with a smaller example again to make sure. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^1 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). The coefficient of \\(a^1b^0\\) in the first part is 1. The sum of coefficients in the second part is \\(2^1 = 2\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^1b^0\\) in the product would be 1 * 2 = 2. Expanding, we get \\(ac + a/c + bc + b/c\\), so the coefficients of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are indeed 2 each. So, that works.\n\nAnother example: \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^2\\). The coefficient of \\(a^2b^0\\) in the first part is 1. The sum of coefficients in the second part is \\(2^2 = 4\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^0\\) in the product is 1 * 4 = 4. Expanding, we have \\(a^2c^2 + 2a^2 + a^2/c^2 + 2abc^2 + 4ab + 2ab/c^2 + b^2c^2 + 2b^2 + b^2/c^2\\). The coefficient of \\(a^2\\) is indeed 4, which matches. Similarly, the coefficient of \\(ab\\) is 2 * 4 = 8, which is correct.\n\nSo, applying this logic to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is \\(2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me think again. The problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", but in the product, each term will be \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by some power of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for any \\(k\\) would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^k\\) in the second expansion. But if the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\), then it's the sum over all \\(k\\) of the coefficients of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), which would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem had asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion, which is 6 * 20 = 120, since \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n\nBut since the problem didn't specify any condition on \\(c\\), I think it's safe to assume that it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), so the answer would be 384.\n\nWait, but let me make sure. Let me compute the product step by step. The first expansion is \\((a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). The second expansion is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15/c^2 + 6/c^4 + 1/c^6\\). Now, when I multiply these two, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, resulting in terms like \\(6a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(36a^2b^2c^4\\), \\(90a^2b^2c^2\\), \\(120a^2b^2\\), \\(90a^2b^2/c^2\\), \\(36a^2b^2/c^4\\), and \\(6a^2b^2/c^6\\).\n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the sum of the coefficients of all these terms. That is, 6 + 36 + 90 + 120 + 90 + 36 + 6. Let me add these up:\n\n6 + 36 = 42\n\n42 + 90 = 132\n\n132 + 120 = 252\n\n252 + 90 = 342\n\n342 + 36 = 378\n\n378 + 6 = 384.\n\nSo, that confirms it. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 384. So, the answer is 384.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me think if there's another way to approach this. Maybe using generating functions or multinomial coefficients, but I think the approach I took is solid. The key idea is that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. Since the sum of coefficients in the second expansion is \\(2^6 = 64\\), and the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion is 6, the total coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nI think that makes sense. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning, and the small examples I tried support this approach. So, I'm confident that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 384.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break the problem into two parts using the binomial theorem.\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k} b^k\n   \\]\n   The term containing \\(a^2b^2\\) is when \\(k = 2\\):\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\n   \\]\n   So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in this part is 6.\n\n2. **Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n   \\]\n   The sum of all coefficients in this expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\):\n   \\[\n   \\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\n   \\]\n\n3. **Combine the results:**\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the product of the coefficient from the first expansion and the sum of coefficients from the second expansion:\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 64 = 384\n   \\]\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{384}\\)."

    "text": " I remember that when dealing with expansions of binomials, the binomial theorem is really useful. So, I think I should apply the binomial theorem to both parts of the expression separately and then see how they combine.\n\nFirst, let me tackle \\((a + b)^4\\). I know that the binomial theorem says that \\((x + y)^n = \\sum_{k=0}^{n} \\dbinom{n}{k} x^{n - k} y^k\\). So, applying this to \\((a + b)^4\\), it should expand to \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k} b^k\\). I'm looking for the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2, so that would be when \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). Let me calculate that term.\n\nThe coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). I remember that \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) is calculated as \\(\\dfrac{4!}{2! \\cdot (4 - 2)!} = \\dfrac{24}{2 \\cdot 2} = 6\\). So, the term is \\(6a^2b^2\\). That part seems straightforward.\n\nNow, moving on to the second part: \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Again, using the binomial theorem, this will expand to \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying each term, that becomes \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m} = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\).\n\nWait, but I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Hmm, but in this second part, the variables are \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), so they don't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\). That means that the entire \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) part will multiply each term from the first expansion, but since it doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), it won't affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, does that mean the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just the same as in the first part, multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part? Wait, no, that doesn't sound right.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but I think I might have misread the problem. Let me check again: it's \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), so the variables involved are \\(a, b, c, 1/c\\), but the term we're looking for is \\(a^2b^2\\). So, in the product of the two expansions, each term will be a product of a term from the first expansion and a term from the second expansion.\n\nBut since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which comes from the first expansion, and any term from the second expansion that's multiplied by it will just contribute a factor, but since the second expansion doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), it's just a constant multiple for each term. Wait, no, that's not correct because each term in the second expansion is a power of \\(c\\), which is a different variable. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would come from taking \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part and any term from the second part, but since the second part doesn't affect \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would just be the same as in the first part multiplied by the entire second expansion. Wait, that can't be right because the second expansion isn't a constant.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, when I expand the product, each term will be a product of a term from the first expansion and a term from the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) can only come from the term in the first expansion that's \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by any term in the second expansion. But since the second expansion is in terms of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), which don't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion.\n\nWait, but that doesn't seem right either because the second expansion isn't a single term but a sum of terms. Let me clarify: the entire expression is the product of two expansions. So, when you multiply them, each term in the first expansion gets multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion because each term in the second expansion is a constant (with respect to \\(a\\) and \\(b\\)) that multiplies the \\(a^2b^2\\) term.\n\nWait, but the second expansion is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial in \\(c\\). So, when I multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by the entire second expansion, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would actually be \\(6\\) times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion. But wait, is that correct?\n\nWait, no, that's not correct because the second expansion isn't a constant; it's a sum of terms each of which is a power of \\(c\\). So, when I multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, each of those will contribute to different terms in the product. But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and the second expansion doesn't affect \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually just be the coefficient from the first expansion multiplied by the entire second expansion. But that doesn't make sense because the second expansion is not a single number but a sum of terms.\n\nWait, maybe I'm getting confused here. Let me try to approach this differently. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). When we multiply these two, each term from \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from taking the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first expansion and multiplying it by each term from the second expansion. Since the second expansion is in terms of \\(c\\), each of these products will be \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by some power of \\(c\\), but the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the sum of the coefficients of all terms in the second part. Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, each term contributes its coefficient to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product.\n\nWait, but that would mean that the coefficient is \\(6\\) times the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Let me check what the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is. The sum of the coefficients is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), so substituting \\(c = 1\\) into \\(\\left(1 + 1/1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, does that mean the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\)? Hmm, that seems high, but let me see if that makes sense.\n\nWait, but actually, no. Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, each term in the second expansion is of the form \\(k \\times c^n\\), so when you multiply, you get \\(k \\times a^2b^2 \\times c^n\\). Therefore, in the entire product, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) is the sum of all the coefficients from the second expansion times the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion. So, that would be \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). Hmm, that seems plausible, but let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think again: the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Since the second part doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), it's just a constant factor when considering terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't make sense because the expansion isn't a single number. Wait, no, actually, it's a polynomial, so when you multiply by a polynomial, each term in the first expansion gets multiplied by each term in the second expansion, but the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient from the first expansion times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. Because each term in the second expansion is a coefficient times a power of \\(c\\), so when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each of those, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) is the sum of all the coefficients in the second expansion times the coefficient from the first expansion.\n\nWait, but when you set \\(c = 1\\), you get the sum of the coefficients of the second expansion, which is 64. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 * 64 = 384. Hmm, that seems correct. Let me check my reasoning again.\n\nSo, \\((a + b)^4\\) gives \\(6a^2b^2\\). \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) when expanded has terms like \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\). The sum of the coefficients is when \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\(2^6 = 64\\). So, when I multiply the two expansions, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. Therefore, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, which contributes a factor of 64 to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\nWait, but I'm not entirely sure. Let me try a different approach. Maybe I can consider the entire product and focus only on the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. So, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient is 6. In \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term is a coefficient times a power of \\(c\\). When I multiply the two, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will be 6 times each term in the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. Since the sum of coefficients in the second expansion is 64, the total coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of it as the product of the two polynomials. The first polynomial is in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the second is in \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient from the first polynomial times the sum of coefficients from the second polynomial, because each term in the second polynomial is a coefficient that multiplies the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. So, that would be 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but another thought: is the second polynomial's sum of coefficients really 64? Let me check. \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) when \\(c = 1\\) is indeed \\(2^6 = 64\\). So, yes, the sum of coefficients is 64.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me just make sure I'm not missing anything. Is there a possibility that when multiplying, the terms could interact in a way that affects the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)? For example, could there be cross terms where \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are multiplied by \\(c\\) terms? But no, because \\(c\\) is a different variable, so \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by any power of \\(c\\) would just be a term like \\(a^2b^2c^n\\), which is different from \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is just the coefficient from the first expansion times the sum of coefficients from the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but another way to think about it is that since \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) are separate variables, the product of the two expansions would be a polynomial in \\(a, b, c, 1/c\\). So, each term in the product is a term from the first expansion times a term from the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) can only come from the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion multiplied by any term in the second expansion, but since those terms don't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), each multiplication just adds a factor of the coefficient from the second expansion to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is indeed 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me check if there's another way to approach this. Maybe I can consider the entire expression as \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) and think about how the coefficients combine. Since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\), and \\(1/c\\) are all separate variables, the only way \\(a^2b^2\\) can appear in the product is if we take the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part and multiply it by any term from the second part. Since the second part doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), each term in the second part is just a coefficient times a power of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me calculate the sum of coefficients in the second expansion again. The sum of coefficients is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), so \\(\\left(1 + 1/1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, that's correct.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Is it possible that the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without considering the \\(c\\) terms? Because if that's the case, then the coefficient would just be 6, because the \\(c\\) terms don't affect \\(a\\) or \\(b\\). But that doesn't seem right because the entire expression is the product of both parts, so the coefficient should account for all the terms in the second expansion.\n\nWait, no, I think my initial reasoning was correct. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 multiplied by the sum of coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but another thought: maybe I'm supposed to consider that the second expansion could contribute to the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in a way that I'm not seeing. But since the second expansion is in terms of \\(c\\), it doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), so it can't affect the \\(a^2b^2\\) term beyond just scaling it by the sum of its coefficients. Therefore, the coefficient should indeed be 384.\n\nWait, but to make sure, let me try a simpler case. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, \\((a + b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2\\), and \\((c + 1/c)^1 = c + 1/c\\). The product would be \\((a^2 + 2ab + b^2)(c + 1/c)\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) would be \\(1 \\times (c + 1/c)\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) in the product would be \\(c + 1/c\\), but if we're looking for the coefficient as a numerical value, that's not possible because it's a polynomial in \\(c\\). Hmm, maybe I'm approaching this wrong.\n\nWait, but in the problem, we're only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which in this case would be \\(2ab \\times (c + 1/c)\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be \\(2 \\times (c + 1/c)\\), which is \\(2c + 2/c\\). But that's not a numerical coefficient; it's a term involving \\(c\\). Hmm, that seems contradictory to my earlier reasoning.\n\nWait, so perhaps I was wrong earlier. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product isn't just a number; it's a polynomial in \\(c\\). So, maybe I need to reconsider my approach.\n\nWait, but the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not considering \\(c\\). So, perhaps the coefficient is actually just the coefficient from the first expansion, because the second expansion doesn't affect \\(a\\) or \\(b\\). So, in the simple case I just considered, \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be zero because there's no \\(a^2b^2\\) term. Wait, no, because \\((a + b)^2\\) only has \\(a^2\\), \\(2ab\\), and \\(b^2\\), so \\(a^2b^2\\) isn't present unless you have higher powers.\n\nWait, maybe I'm confusing myself. Let me go back to the original problem. The original problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, in this case, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term comes from \\((a + b)^4\\), which has a coefficient of 6, and then multiplied by each term from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which are terms involving \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times each term from the second expansion. But that would mean that the coefficient isn't a single number but a polynomial in \\(c\\). However, the problem is asking for the coefficient, which is typically a numerical value, so maybe I'm misunderstanding.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) or something, but it's not specified. Hmm, that complicates things. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). In that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which would be a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", which might imply that we're considering the coefficient in the entire product, which would involve \\(c\\). But that seems more complicated.\n\nWait, perhaps I misread the problem. Let me check again: it says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\)\". So, it's possible that the problem is considering the entire product as a polynomial in \\(a, b, c, 1/c\\), and it's asking for the coefficient of the term \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). In that case, the coefficient would be the sum of all terms in the product where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any power of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial. But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, not a single number, which seems odd.\n\nWait, but perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\). That would make more sense because then we're looking for a specific term. So, in that case, the coefficient would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion.\n\nSo, let me try that approach. Let me first find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, as before. Then, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, let me calculate that.\n\nUsing the binomial theorem, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\times c^{-m} = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire product is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nWait, that makes more sense. So, perhaps I misread the problem initially. It's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but without specifying \\(c\\), but in the context, it's more likely that it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where the exponents of \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are 2, 2, and 0, respectively.\n\nSo, to clarify, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), but in the product, \\(c\\) is present, so the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by some power of \\(c\\). Therefore, if we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without considering \\(c\\), it would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial. But if we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it's 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion, which is 20, giving 120.\n\nBut the problem didn't specify \\(c^0\\), so I'm a bit confused. Let me check the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, it's just asking for \\(a^2b^2\\), without specifying \\(c\\). Hmm.\n\nWait, maybe I should think of it as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, considering all possible powers of \\(c\\). But in that case, the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make much sense because coefficients are usually constants. So, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\), which is 1. In that case, the coefficient is 120.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to ignore the \\(c\\) terms and just consider the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating the second expansion as a constant. But that doesn't make sense because the second expansion is a polynomial in \\(c\\), not a constant.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, so the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, which seems odd because the problem asks for \"the coefficient\", implying a single number.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to consider that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, giving 384.\n\nBut then, in that case, the coefficient would be 384, which is a single number, and that seems plausible.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nI think I need to clarify which interpretation is correct. Let me think about the problem again.\n\nThe problem is: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\"\n\nSo, when it says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", it's ambiguous because \\(a^2b^2\\) could be multiplied by any power of \\(c\\). So, perhaps the problem is intended to ask for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\). In that case, the coefficient is 120.\n\nAlternatively, if it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then it's 384.\n\nBut in the context of such problems, usually, when multiple variables are involved, the problem specifies the exponents for each variable. Since it only specifies \\(a^2b^2\\), perhaps it's intended to ignore the \\(c\\) terms, treating them as constants. But that's not accurate because \\(c\\) is a variable.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, considering the entire expression as a polynomial in \\(a, b, c, 1/c\\). So, the coefficient would be the sum of all terms in the product where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present, which would be 6 times each term in the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which would be 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that seems too involved, and the problem probably expects a numerical answer.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is miswritten, and it's supposed to be \\((a + b + c + 1/c)^4\\), but no, that's not what's given.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to consider the product as a polynomial in \\(a, b, c\\), and it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable. But in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial, not a single number. So, that can't be right.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try to see if the problem is similar to any standard problems I've seen before. I think sometimes, when you have a product of two binomials, and you're asked for the coefficient of a specific term, it's implied that you consider the term without any other variables, but in this case, since \\(c\\) is involved, it's unclear.\n\nWait, another approach: perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating \\(c\\) as a constant. So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial, but if we're treating \\(c\\) as a constant, then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that seems odd because \\(c\\) is a variable, not a constant.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is expecting me to consider that \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is a constant when considering terms in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be 6 times the entire expansion. But that doesn't make sense because the coefficient should be a number, not a polynomial.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, considering all possible powers of \\(c\\), which would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, giving 384.\n\nWait, but let me think about this differently. If I expand the entire product, each term in the product will be of the form \\(a^{4 - k}b^{k}c^{6 - 2m}\\), where \\(k\\) ranges from 0 to 4 and \\(m\\) ranges from 0 to 6. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would occur when \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\), so \\(k=2\\), and \\(m\\) can be any value from 0 to 6, because the exponent of \\(c\\) doesn't affect the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but in that case, the coefficient is 384, which is a number, not a polynomial. So, perhaps that's the intended answer.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then the coefficient is 120, as calculated earlier.\n\nBut given the problem statement, it's ambiguous. However, in most cases, when such a problem is posed, it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), which would be 384. Alternatively, if it's asking for \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), it's 120.\n\nWait, perhaps I can check by considering specific values. Let me set \\(a = 1\\), \\(b = 1\\), and \\(c = 1\\). Then, the entire expression becomes \\((1 + 1)^4 \\times (1 + 1)^6 = 2^4 \\times 2^6 = 16 \\times 64 = 1024\\). Now, if I set \\(a = 1\\), \\(b = 1\\), \\(c = 1\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 1, and the entire expression would evaluate to 1024. But the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times the value of the second expansion at \\(c = 1\\) is 6 * 64 = 384, which is less than 1024, so that suggests that the coefficient is 384.\n\nWait, but actually, when \\(a = 1\\), \\(b = 1\\), the entire first expansion becomes \\(2^4 = 16\\), and the second expansion becomes \\(2^6 = 64\\), so the product is 16 * 64 = 1024. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion is 6, and when multiplied by the entire second expansion, it becomes 6 * 64 = 384, which is part of the total 1024. So, that seems to confirm that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 384.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then setting \\(c = 1\\) would give the coefficient as 120, but that's not the case here because the entire product at \\(c = 1\\) is 1024, which is much larger.\n\nWait, but let me think again. If I set \\(a = 1\\), \\(b = 1\\), \\(c = 1\\), then the entire expression is 1024. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion is 6, and the second expansion is 64, so the product of those is 384, which is part of the total. But the total when \\(a = 1\\), \\(b = 1\\), \\(c = 1\\) is 1024, which includes all terms, not just \\(a^2b^2\\). So, that doesn't directly help.\n\nWait, perhaps I can consider that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 384, and that is the answer. Alternatively, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it's 120. But given the problem statement, I think the intended answer is 384.\n\nWait, but another way to check: let's expand both parts and see.\n\nFirst, \\((a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\).\n\nSecond, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15/c^2 + 6/c^4 + 1/c^6\\).\n\nNow, when we multiply these two, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, resulting in terms like \\(6a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(6a^2b^2c^4\\), \\(6a^2b^2c^2\\), \\(6a^2b^2\\), \\(6a^2b^2/c^2\\), etc. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in"

    "text": " I'm a bit rusty on some of these algebra concepts, but I'll give it a shot.\n\nFirst, I know that when you have an expression like \\((a + b)^n\\), you can expand it using the binomial theorem. The binomial theorem states that \\((a + b)^n = \\sum_{k=0}^{n} \\dbinom{n}{k} a^{n - k} b^k\\). So, maybe I can apply that here.\n\nThe problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). That means I need to find the term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2. Let me write that down.\n\nSo, \\((a + b)^4\\) can be expanded as:\n\\[\n\\dbinom{4}{0}a^4b^0 + \\dbinom{4}{1}a^3b^1 + \\dbinom{4}{2}a^2b^2 + \\dbinom{4}{3}a^1b^3 + \\dbinom{4}{4}a^0b^4\n\\]\nLooking at this, the term with \\(a^2b^2\\) is the third term, which is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}a^2b^2\\). I remember that \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) is calculated as \\(\\dfrac{4!}{2!2!}\\), which is \\(\\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6.\n\nNow, the expression also has another part: \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I'm not sure if I need to expand this part as well or if it's just a multiplier. Wait, since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), maybe I can treat \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) as a constant with respect to \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). Hmm, but that doesn't seem right. Let me think.\n\nActually, no, the entire expression is multiplied together, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\). So, does that mean I need to consider only the terms in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) that result in a constant term (i.e., where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero)? Because if I multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by a term that has \\(c^k\\), it would become \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), which isn't what we want. So, I think I need the constant term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) to pair with \\(a^2b^2\\).\n\nSo, let me tackle \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) next. Again, I can use the binomial theorem here. The expansion is:\n\\[\n\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} c^{-k} = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n\\]\nSo, each term in the expansion is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). I need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero because that's the constant term. So, I set the exponent equal to zero:\n\\[\n6 - 2k = 0\n\\]\nSolving for \\(k\\), I get:\n\\[\n2k = 6 \\implies k = 3\n\\]\nSo, the constant term is when \\(k = 3\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} c^{0} = \\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). Wait, no, that's not right. Let me correct that.\n\nActually, \\(6! = 720\\), \\(3! = 6\\), so \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). Yeah, that's correct. So, the constant term is 20.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is the product of the coefficient from the first part and the constant term from the second part. That is, 6 (from \\(a^2b^2\\)) multiplied by 20 (the constant term). So, 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, let me double-check that. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part has a coefficient of 6, and the constant term in the second part is 20. So when we multiply these two parts together, each term in the expansion of the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and the second part's constant term is 20, then the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 * 20, which is indeed 120.\n\nIs there anything I might be missing here? Let me think. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\). So, I correctly identified that I needed the constant term from the second part. If I had included other terms from the second part, they would have introduced powers of \\(c\\), which we don't want in the final term \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, only the constant term from the second part contributes to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\).\n\nSo, to recap:\n\n1. Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is 6.\n2. Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem to find the constant term, which is 20.\n3. Multiply these two coefficients together to get the final coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, which is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nI think that makes sense. Let me just verify the calculations again to be sure.\n\nCalculating \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\):\n\n\\[\n\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\n\\]\nYes, that's correct.\n\nCalculating \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\):\n\n\\[\n\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 * 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\n\\]\nThat's also correct.\n\nSo, multiplying 6 and 20 gives 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120.\n\nI don't think I made any mistakes here. The key was recognizing that to get the term without \\(c\\), I needed the constant term from the second binomial expansion, and then multiplying it by the coefficient from the first part. Yeah, that seems solid.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break it down into two parts:\n\n1. **Expanding \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k} b^k\n   \\]\n   The term with \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}a^2b^2\\). Calculating the binomial coefficient:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\n   \\]\n   So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\n2. **Expanding \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n   \\]\n   We need the constant term, which occurs when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero:\n   \\[\n   6 - 2k = 0 \\implies k = 3\n   \\]\n   The constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating the binomial coefficient:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\n   \\]\n\n3. **Multiplying the coefficients:**\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficients from the two parts:\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 20 = 120\n   \\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

So, maybe I can apply that here.\n\nThe expression I'm dealing with is \\((a + b)^4\\). So, I can expand this part first. Let me write out the expansion. For \\(n = 4\\), the expansion will be:\n\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n\\]\n\nSo, each term is \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\\) for \\(k = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4\\). Now, I need the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). That means I need the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2. So, let's see, in the term \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\\), if \\(4 - k = 2\\), then \\(k = 2\\). So, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\).\n\nCalculating that, \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. That's straightforward.\n\nNow, the original expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, but the second part involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, does that affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)? Hmm, I think not directly, because \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\). So, maybe the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, that doesn't seem quite right because when you multiply two expressions, each term from the first is multiplied by each term from the second. So, maybe I need to consider the product more carefully.\n\nWait, but the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, perhaps I don't need to consider the \\(c\\) terms at all? Because \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\). So, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) will be multiplied by terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), maybe all the terms from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) will just be multiplied by the coefficient 6, and since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient remains 6. But that seems too simple. Maybe I'm missing something.\n\nWait, no, actually, when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6a^2b^2, and when you multiply this by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), you get 6a^2b^2 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, that doesn't seem right either because \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is another binomial expansion, and when you multiply by 6a^2b^2, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would be 6 times \\(2^6 = 64\\), because each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) has coefficients that add up to \\(2^6\\) when \\(c = 1\\). So, 6 times 64 would be 384. But wait, that seems high. Let me check that again.\n\nWait, no, I think I'm confusing the concept. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would actually be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is a term with some power of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), but when you multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times each term's coefficient in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that's not exactly right because each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is of the form \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, each term is a coefficient times a power of \\(c\\). But when you multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term without \\(c\\), the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would actually be 6 times each of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), resulting in terms like \\(6 \\times \\dbinom{6}{m} a^2b^2 c^{6 - 2m}\\). But wait, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but \\(a^2b^2\\) is not a term that includes \\(c\\). So, does that mean we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)? Because otherwise, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each of which has a different power of \\(c\\), so the only way \\(a^2b^2\\) would stand alone is if we're considering the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, i.e., \\(c^0\\), which is 1.\n\nWait, that makes sense. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), then multiply it by 6 to get the final coefficient.\n\nOkay, so let me focus on finding the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). To do this, I can use the binomial theorem again. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is:\n\n\\[\n\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n\\]\n\nSo, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We're looking for the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, which means \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\):\n\n\\(6 - 2m = 0\\)\n\n\\(2m = 6\\)\n\n\\(m = 3\\)\n\nSo, the term where \\(m = 3\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} c^{0}\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\).\n\nCalculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). Wait, that doesn't seem right because 6! is 720, but 3! is 6, so 3!3! is 6\u00d76=36. 720 divided by 36 is 20. Yes, that's correct.\n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 times 20, which is 120.\n\nWait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake. So, the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) gives 6a^2b^2, and the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) gives 20 as the coefficient for \\(c^0\\). So, when we multiply these two, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by 20, so the coefficient becomes 6 \u00d7 20 = 120.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should think of it as the product of two independent expansions. So, when you have \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion is 6a^2b^2, and when multiplied by the entire second expansion, it becomes 6a^2b^2 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), we need to consider how many times \\(a^2b^2\\) appears with different powers of \\(c\\). But actually, no, because \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), so when you multiply it by the second expansion, you get terms like \\(6a^2b^2 \\times \\text{(terms with } c)\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would only be the case when the term from the second expansion is 1, i.e., when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. So, only the term where \\(c^0\\) is present in the second expansion will contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient is 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion, which is 20, so 6 \u00d7 20 = 120.\n\nWait, that seems consistent. Let me double-check the binomial coefficients. For \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). For \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, 6 \u00d7 20 = 120.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of the entire product as a single expansion and find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), but since the problem only asks for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), but wait, no, that's not correct. Because in the product, each term from the first expansion is multiplied by each term from the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, each of which has some power of \\(c\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would only be present if the second term is \\(c^0\\), because otherwise, you'd have \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), which isn't just \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, but the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so perhaps it's considering only the term where the power of \\(c\\) is zero. So, that's why we have to multiply 6 by 20, giving 120.\n\nWait, but let me think again. If the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then actually, every term in the expansion would have some power of \\(c\\), so \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, each with a different power of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in the second expansion. But that can't be right because the sum of coefficients in the second expansion is when \\(c = 1\\), which is \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, 6 \u00d7 64 = 384. But that contradicts my earlier conclusion of 120. Hmm, so which is correct?\n\nWait, perhaps I'm confusing two different things. If the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then the coefficient would indeed be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, because each term in the second expansion would multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. But if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), then it's 6 times 20. But the problem statement is: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, it's just \\(a^2b^2\\), without any mention of \\(c\\). So, perhaps the problem is considering the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times any power of \\(c\\), meaning that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 \u00d7 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but that seems conflicting. Let me try to clarify. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When you expand this, each term will be of the form \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k \\times \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\(k = 2\\) in the first expansion, and it's multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, because each term in the second expansion is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion is when \\(c = 1\\), which is \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, the coefficient would be 6 \u00d7 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was 120. So, which is it? I'm confused now.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to consider that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in other words, it's the sum of all coefficients where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present, multiplied by any power of \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 \u00d7 64 = 384.\n\nBut that contradicts my earlier thought where I considered only the term where \\(c^0\\) is present. So, which interpretation is correct?\n\nWait, let me check the problem statement again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" It doesn't specify anything about \\(c\\), so I think it's asking for the coefficient of the term \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, that would mean that every time \\(a^2b^2\\) appears in the product, it's multiplied by some power of \\(c\\), and the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the sum of all those coefficients. So, that would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 \u00d7 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but that seems high. Let me think of a simpler example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^1 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, the expansion would be \\((a + b)(c + 1/c)\\). The coefficient of \\(a^1b^0\\) would be 1 times (c + 1/c), so the coefficient of \\(a^1b^0\\) is 1 times the sum of coefficients in (c + 1/c), which is 1 \u00d7 2 = 2. But in reality, the expansion is \\(ac + a/c + bc + b/c\\), so the coefficient of \\(a\\) is 1 for \\(ac\\) and 1 for \\(a/c\\), so the coefficient of \\(a\\) is 1 + 1 = 2, which matches. Similarly, the coefficient of \\(b\\) is also 2. So, in that case, the coefficient of \\(a\\) is indeed 2, which is 1 (from the first expansion) times 2 (sum of coefficients in the second expansion). So, applying that logic, in our original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times 64, which is 384.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was 120 because I considered only the term where \\(c^0\\) is present. So, maybe my initial approach was wrong, and the correct answer is 384.\n\nWait, but let me think again. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\). So, in the product, each term is of the form \\(a^{4 - k}b^k c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would require \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\), and then \\(c^{6 - 2m}\\) can be any power. But wait, no, because the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is just a term in the product, so when you multiply by the second expansion, each term in the second expansion is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 \u00d7 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but in the example I did earlier, with \\((a + b)(c + 1/c)\\), the coefficient of \\(a\\) is 2, which is 1 \u00d7 2. So, that seems to support the idea that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 \u00d7 64 = 384.\n\nBut then, why did I think it was 120 earlier? Because I was considering only the term where \\(c^0\\) is present. Maybe I was misinterpreting the problem. Let me check the problem statement again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" It doesn't specify any condition on \\(c\\), so I think it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, that would mean that each time \\(a^2b^2\\) appears multiplied by some power of \\(c\\), we sum all those coefficients. Therefore, the coefficient would be 6 \u00d7 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but that seems too large. Let me think differently. Maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\). That would make sense if the problem is looking for a specific term. So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 \u00d7 20 = 120.\n\nBut the problem statement doesn't specify \\(c^0\\), so I'm not sure. Let me try to look for similar problems or think about how such problems are usually phrased. Typically, when a problem asks for the coefficient of a term in a product of expansions, it's considering the term with specific exponents for all variables, but if a variable isn't mentioned, it's often considered as having exponent zero. So, in this case, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be 120.\n\nWait, but the problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", without mentioning \\(c\\). So, perhaps it's just considering the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times any power of \\(c\\). So, that would mean the sum of all coefficients where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present, regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in that case, it's 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 \u00d7 64 = 384.\n\nI'm getting conflicting conclusions here. Maybe I should approach it differently. Let me consider that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in other words, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) can be multiplied by any power of \\(c\\), and the coefficient would be the sum of all such coefficients. So, that would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 \u00d7 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it's 6 \u00d7 20 = 120.\n\nBut since the problem doesn't specify \\(c\\), I think it's more likely that it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), which would be 384. But I'm not entirely sure. Let me check with a smaller example.\n\nSuppose I have \\((a + b)^1 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). The expansion is \\((a + b)(c + 1/c) = ac + a/c + bc + b/c\\). The coefficient of \\(a\\) is 1 (for \\(ac\\)) + 1 (for \\(a/c\\)) = 2. Similarly, the coefficient of \\(b\\) is 2. So, in this case, the coefficient of \\(a\\) is 2, which is 1 (from the first expansion) times 2 (sum of coefficients in the second expansion). So, that supports the idea that the coefficient is 6 \u00d7 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but in this case, the problem would be asking for the coefficient of \\(a\\), and the answer would be 2, which is correct. So, applying the same logic, in our original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 \u00d7 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but I'm still not entirely confident. Let me think again. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product comes from multiplying the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in \\((a + b)^4\\) by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, each term in the second expansion is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\), so when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), it becomes \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} \\times \\dbinom{6}{m} a^2b^2 c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^{6 - 2m}\\) is \\(6 \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, that would mean summing over all possible \\(m\\), so the coefficient is \\(6 \\times \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m}\\). But \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\nAlternatively, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then \\(m = 3\\), so the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nBut the problem doesn't specify \\(c^0\\), so I think it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). Therefore, the answer should be 384.\n\nWait, but let me check the original problem again. It says: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" It doesn't specify anything about \\(c\\), so I think it's correct that the coefficient is 384.\n\nBut wait, I'm getting conflicting results based on interpretation. Let me try to clarify with an example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). The expansion would be \\((a^2 + 2ab + b^2)(c + 1/c)\\). The coefficient of \\(ab\\) would be 2 times (c + 1/c), so the coefficient of \\(ab\\) is 2 \u00d7 2 = 4, because the sum of coefficients in the second expansion is 2. So, in this case, the coefficient of \\(ab\\) is 4, which is correct because the expansion is \\(a^2c + a^2/c + 2abc + 2ab/c + b^2c + b^2/c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(ab\\) is 2 (from \\(2abc\\)) + 2 (from \\(2ab/c\\)) = 4, which is 2 (from the first expansion) times 2 (sum of coefficients in the second expansion). So, that supports the idea that the coefficient is 6 \u00d7 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but in this example, the coefficient of \\(ab\\) is 4, which is 2 \u00d7 2, so that seems consistent. So, applying that logic, in our original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 \u00d7 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but I'm still confused because I initially thought it was 120, but now I'm leaning towards 384. Let me try to think differently. Maybe I can consider that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), so each time \\(a^2b^2\\) appears, it's multiplied by some power of \\(c\\), and the coefficient is the sum of all those coefficients. So, that would be 6 \u00d7 (sum of coefficients in the second expansion) = 6 \u00d7 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it's 6 \u00d7 20 = 120.\n\nBut the problem statement is ambiguous. It just says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\". Without specifying \\(c\\), I think it's more likely that it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), which would be 384.\n\nWait, but let me think about how the product works. Each term in the product is a combination of a term from the first expansion and a term from the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion is multiplied by each term from the second expansion, which are \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^{6 - 2m}\\) is \\(6 \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), which would mean that we're summing over all \\(m\\), so the coefficient is \\(6 \\times \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m}\\), which is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\nBut I'm still not entirely sure. Maybe I should look up similar problems or think about how such problems are typically framed. Usually, when a problem asks for the coefficient of a term in a product without specifying other variables, it's considering the term with those exponents regardless of other variables. So, in this case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 384.\n\nWait, but I'm still not confident. Let me try to think differently. Suppose I set \\(c = 1\\). Then, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = (1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, the entire expression becomes \\((a + b)^4 \\times 64\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in this case would be 6 \u00d7 64 = 384. So, that seems to confirm that the coefficient is 384.\n\nAlternatively, if I set \\(c\\) to something else, like \\(c = t\\), then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, so 6 \u00d7 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me try to approach it from another angle. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product of two expansions. So, in the product, each term is a product of a term from the first expansion and a term from the second. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first expansion, and it's multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient from the first expansion times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. Because each term in the second expansion is a coefficient times a power of \\(c\\), but when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), it just adds to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion is 64, so 6 \u00d7 64 = 384.\n\nTherefore, after all this thinking, I believe the coefficient is 384.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was 120. Maybe I made a mistake in my initial approach. Let me try to clarify.\n\nIf I consider the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion, it's 6a^2b^2. When I multiply this by the second expansion, which is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the result is 6a^2b^2 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is now present in the product with coefficients multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 \u00d7 64 = 384.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So, I think the correct answer is 384.\n\nWait, but I'm still a bit unsure because I initially thought it was 120. Let me try to think of it as a product of two polynomials. The first polynomial is \\((a + b)^4\\), which has terms up to \\(a^4\\) and \\(b^4\\), and the second is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which has terms from \\(c^6\\) down to \\(c^{-6}\\). When you multiply them, each term from the first is multiplied by each term from the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first is multiplied by each term in the second, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient from the first times the sum of all coefficients in the second, which is 6 \u00d7 64 = 384.\n\nYes, I think that's correct. So, the coefficient is 384.\n\nWait, but let me check one more time. Let's compute the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion: \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). The sum of coefficients is when \\(c = 1\\), so \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 \u00d7 64 = 384.\n\nYes, that seems consistent.\n\nAlternatively, if I think of the entire expression as a product, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the same as the coefficient in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 \u00d7 64 = 384.\n\nSo, after all this, I think the correct answer is 384.\n\nWait, but I'm still a bit confused because I thought earlier that only the term where \\(c^0\\) is present would contribute to \\(a^2b^2\\). But now I realize that in the product, \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the sum of all those coefficients, which is 6 \u00d7 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me think of it as a generating function. If I have \\((a + b)^4\\) and I multiply it by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the same as the coefficient in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), because each term in the second expansion is a coefficient times a power of \\(c\\), and when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), it just scales the coefficient"

    "text": " \n\nFirst, I remember that when dealing with expressions raised to a power, the binomial theorem is really useful. The binomial theorem says that \\((x + y)^n = \\sum_{k=0}^{n} \\dbinom{n}{k} x^{n - k} y^k\\). So maybe I can apply that here.\n\nThe problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). That term is specifically in the \\((a + b)^4\\) part, right? Because the other part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So maybe I can handle each part separately and then multiply the results together.\n\nLet me start with the first part: \\((a + b)^4\\). I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in this expansion. Using the binomial theorem, each term in the expansion is \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k} b^k\\), where \\(k\\) goes from 0 to 4. So, the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) occurs would be when \\(4 - k = 2\\) for \\(a\\), which means \\(k = 2\\) for \\(b\\). \n\nSo, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Let me calculate that. \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). Okay, so that part is clear. The coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\nNow, moving on to the second part: \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I'm not directly asked about this part, but since the entire expression is the product of \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), I need to consider how these two parts interact.\n\nWait a second, the problem is specifically asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). But in the second part, there are no \\(a\\) or \\(b\\) terms, only \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, does that mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just the same as the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the entire second part? Or is there more to it?\n\nLet me think. If I have \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), then every term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by every term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I need to find all the terms in the product where the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) parts are \\(a^2b^2\\), and then sum up the coefficients of those terms.\n\nBut since the second part only has \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first part will be multiplied by every term in the second part. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be the coefficient from the first part (which is 6) multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. But wait, that doesn't make sense because the second part is a sum of terms involving \\(c\\), so when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), it would create terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), etc., each with their own coefficients.\n\nBut the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, no, actually, hold on. The problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\" in the entire expression. But in the entire expression, \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by some combination of \\(c\\) terms. So, unless the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which would be the case if we're treating \\(c\\) as another variable. But that doesn't seem right because \\(a^2b^2\\) would be part of terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), etc. So, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem.\n\nWait, let me read the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), treating \\(c\\) as another variable. So, in other words, when you multiply out the entire expression, you'll have terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), \\(a^2b^2c^2\\), \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), and \\(a^2b^2c^{-2}\\), etc. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually be the sum of all the coefficients from the second part, because each term in the second part, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), contributes to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product.\n\nWait, that seems a bit confusing. Let me clarify. If I have \\( (a + b)^4 \\) multiplied by \\( \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 \\), then each term in the expansion of \\( (a + b)^4 \\) is multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\( \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 \\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, which includes \\(c^6\\), \\(6c^4\\), \\(15c^2\\), \\(20\\), \\(15c^{-2}\\), \\(6c^{-4}\\), and \\(c^{-6}\\).\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients in the second part. Because each term in the second part has a coefficient, and when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), those coefficients add up to the total coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product.\n\nWait, but is that correct? Let me think. If I have \\( (a^2b^2) \\times \\left( c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15c^{-2} + 6c^{-4} + c^{-6} \\right) \\), then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would indeed be the sum of the coefficients from the second part, because each term is a multiple of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient would be \\(6\\) (from the first part) multiplied by the sum of the coefficients in the second part.\n\nBut wait, the second part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me calculate the sum of its coefficients. To find the sum of the coefficients in a polynomial, I can substitute \\(c = 1\\). So, substituting \\(c = 1\\) into \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) gives \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of the coefficients in the second part is 64.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). Hmm, that seems high, but let me check.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think differently. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but in the entire product, each term is a product of a term from \\((a + b)^4\\) and a term from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) can only come from the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by any term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 64.\n\nSo, 6 times 64 is 384. Therefore, the coefficient is 384. But let me double-check this logic.\n\nWait, another way to think about it: when you multiply two polynomials together, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum of the products of the coefficients of terms whose variables multiply to give that specific term. In this case, since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are only in the first polynomial, and \\(c\\) is only in the second, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) can only come from \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial times any term in the second polynomial. Therefore, the coefficient is indeed the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial.\n\nSo, yes, that makes sense. The sum of the coefficients in the second polynomial is 64, so 6 times 64 is 384. Therefore, the coefficient is 384.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in calculating the sum of the coefficients. Let me calculate \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) when \\(c = 1\\). So, substituting \\(c = 1\\), we get \\((1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). That's correct. So, the sum of the coefficients is indeed 64.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 * 64 = 384. Hmm, that seems right.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression really 384? Because when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), so the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by every term in the second polynomial, each contributing their own coefficient. So, the total coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem had asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some specific \\(k\\), then we would have to find the specific coefficient in the second polynomial. But since it's just \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), the coefficient is the sum of all the coefficients from the second polynomial multiplied by 6.\n\nSo, I think that's the correct approach. Therefore, the coefficient is 384.\n\nWait, but let me think if there's another way to approach this problem. Maybe by expanding both parts separately and then looking for the coefficient.\n\nFirst, let's expand \\((a + b)^4\\). Using the binomial theorem:\n\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k} b^k\n\\]\n\nSo, the term with \\(a^2b^2\\) is when \\(k = 2\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\\). So, that's correct.\n\nNow, expanding \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Again, using the binomial theorem:\n\n\\[\n\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n\\]\n\nSo, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\), where \\(m\\) ranges from 0 to 6.\n\nNow, when we multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, which are \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\) for \\(m = 0\\) to \\(6\\).\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion, which is 6, multiplied by the sum of the coefficients from the second expansion. But the coefficients in the second expansion are \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\) for each term, so the sum of these coefficients is when \\(c = 1\\), which is \\(2^6 = 64\\), as I thought earlier.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\nWait, but let me make sure that I'm not missing anything. Is there a possibility that the term \\(a^2b^2\\) could come from other terms in the expansion besides the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in \\((a + b)^4\\)? For example, could a term like \\(a^3b\\) multiplied by something give \\(a^2b^2\\)? But no, because \\(a^3b\\) multiplied by any term in the second polynomial would still have \\(a^3b\\), and \\(a^2b^2\\) can't come from that. Similarly, \\(ab^3\\) multiplied by something can't give \\(a^2b^2\\) because that would require reducing the exponent of \\(b\\) by 1, which isn't possible here. So, only the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first expansion contributes to the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the product.\n\nTherefore, my initial reasoning seems correct. The coefficient is 384.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Is the problem perhaps asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by 1 (so \\(c^0\\))? Because in the second expansion, the term with \\(c^0\\) is when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which gives \\(m = 3\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it would be 6 * 20 = 120. But the problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", without specifying any \\(c\\) terms. So, does that mean it's considering all possible \\(c\\) exponents, or just the constant term?\n\nWait, that's a good point. The problem is a bit ambiguous. If it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then it's 384. But if it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it's 120.\n\nLooking back at the problem statement: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" It just says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", without specifying any \\(c\\) terms. So, in algebra, when you're asked for the coefficient of a term, it's usually considering the term with all variables included. But in this case, \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term, and when multiplied by terms from the second polynomial, it becomes \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for various \\(k\\). So, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, then it's the sum of all coefficients where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present, which would be 384.\n\nBut I'm not entirely sure. Maybe I should check both interpretations.\n\nFirst interpretation: The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), which would be 384.\n\nSecond interpretation: The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be 120.\n\nBut let me think about how the problem is phrased. It says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\". In the product, \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term from the second polynomial, so each term in the product is \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) where \\(k\\) can be any even integer from -6 to 6. Therefore, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) itself isn't present; it's always multiplied by some power of \\(c\\). So, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, then it's 384. But if it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it's 120.\n\nWait, but in the problem statement, it's written as \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\". So, perhaps it's considering \\(a^2b^2\\) as a term on its own, but in the product, \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by various powers of \\(c\\), so the term \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't exist on its own. Therefore, maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the constant term with respect to \\(c\\). That would make sense, because otherwise, if you consider all terms with \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\), then the coefficient is 384, but that's a bit non-standard.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is miswritten, and it's actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). But since the problem specifically says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", I think the intended interpretation is that we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by any power of \\(c\\), which would be 384.\n\nBut to make sure, let me consider both cases.\n\nCase 1: Coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\). Then, as I thought before, it's 384.\n\nCase 2: Coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). Then, it's 6 (from the first part) multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part, which is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nBut which one is it? The problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\". So, in the product, \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by various powers of \\(c\\), so the term \\(a^2b^2\\) isn't present alone. Therefore, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the constant term with respect to \\(c\\). So, maybe 120 is the answer.\n\nWait, but that's conflicting with my earlier reasoning. Let me think again.\n\nIf I have the product \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), then each term in the expansion is of the form \\(\\text{(term from first expansion)} \\times \\text{(term from second expansion)}\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, which are \\(c^6\\), \\(6c^4\\), \\(15c^2\\), \\(20\\), \\(15c^{-2}\\), \\(6c^{-4}\\), and \\(c^{-6}\\). Therefore, the product will have terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(6a^2b^2c^4\\), \\(15a^2b^2c^2\\), \\(20a^2b^2\\), \\(15a^2b^2c^{-2}\\), \\(6a^2b^2c^{-4}\\), and \\(a^2b^2c^{-6}\\).\n\nSo, in the entire product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is present only once, multiplied by 20. Therefore, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), i.e., the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2 each and the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, then the coefficient is 20 * 6 = 120.\n\nBut if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the exponent of \\(c\\), then it's the sum of all coefficients where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present, which would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nBut now I'm confused because the problem statement isn't entirely clear. It just says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\". So, in the product, \\(a^2b^2\\) is part of multiple terms, each with different exponents of \\(c\\). Therefore, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for any \\(k\\), then it's 384. But if it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it's 120.\n\nI think the problem is more likely asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), because otherwise, it would be a bit unusual to ask for the coefficient of a term that's part of multiple terms in the product. So, perhaps I should consider that.\n\nBut to make sure, let me think about how the problem is phrased. It says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\". If we're treating \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) as separate variables, then \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term with \\(c\\) raised to some exponent. So, if we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without any restriction on \\(c\\), then it's 384. But if we're looking for \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), it's 120.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is written in a way that \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are the only variables, and \\(c\\) is a constant or something. But that doesn't seem right because \\(c\\) is another variable.\n\nWait, another approach: Maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable, so the coefficient would include all the terms from the second expansion. So, in that case, it's 384.\n\nBut I'm not entirely sure. Let me check some examples. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1)^2\\). What would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^0\\)? It would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^0\\) in the first part, which is 1, multiplied by the sum of coefficients in the second part, which is \\((1 + 1)^2 = 4\\). So, the coefficient would be 1 * 4 = 4, and the terms would be \\(a^2c^2\\), \\(2a^2c\\), \\(2a^2\\), and \\(2a^2c^{-1}\\), etc. Wait, no, actually, in this example, it's \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1)^2\\), so the term \\(a^2\\) would be multiplied by each term in \\((c + 1)^2\\), which is \\(c^2 + 2c + 1\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) would be 1 * (1 + 2 + 1) = 4, which is correct because the terms would be \\(a^2c^2\\), \\(2a^2c\\), and \\(a^2\\), each with coefficients 1, 2, and 1 respectively. So, the sum is 4.\n\nSimilarly, in our original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the sum of the coefficients from the second part, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nTherefore, I think that's the correct approach. So, the coefficient is 384.\n\nWait, but let me confirm with another example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^1 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). What's the coefficient of \\(a^1b^0\\)? It would be 1 (from the first part) multiplied by the sum of coefficients in the second part, which is \\((1 + 1) = 2\\). So, the coefficient would be 2, meaning the terms are \\(a c\\) and \\(a \\times 1/c\\), each with coefficient 1, so total coefficient is 2. That makes sense.\n\nSimilarly, in our problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 multiplied by 64, which is 384. So, that seems correct.\n\nTherefore, I think the answer is 384. But just to make sure, let me calculate the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion again. The second expansion is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). The sum of the coefficients is when \\(c = 1\\), which is \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, yes, that's correct.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but I just realized something. The problem is written as \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when we expand this, each term in the product will have exponents of \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\). The term \\(a^2b^2\\) can only come from the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first expansion multiplied by any term in the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient is indeed the product of the coefficients, which is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64. So, 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nYes, I think that's the correct answer. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 384.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{384}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break the problem into two parts using the binomial theorem.\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k} b^k\n   \\]\n   The term \\(a^2b^2\\) occurs when \\(k = 2\\):\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\n   \\]\n   Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\n2. **Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n   \\]\n   The sum of the coefficients in this expansion is found by substituting \\(c = 1\\):\n   \\[\n   \\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\n   \\]\n\n3. **Combine the results:**\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficient from the first part and the sum of the coefficients from the second part:\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 64 = 384\n   \\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\boxed{384}\\)."

    "text": " \n\nFirst, I remember that when dealing with expressions raised to a power, the binomial theorem is super useful. The binomial theorem says that \\((x + y)^n = \\sum_{k=0}^{n} \\dbinom{n}{k} x^{n - k} y^k\\). So, maybe I can apply this theorem to both parts of the expression separately and then see how they combine.\n\nLet me start with the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\). Applying the binomial theorem here, the expansion will be:\n\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k} b^{k}\n\\]\n\nSo, the terms will be:\n\n- When \\(k = 0\\): \\(\\dbinom{4}{0} a^4 b^0 = 1 \\cdot a^4 \\cdot 1 = a^4\\)\n- When \\(k = 1\\): \\(\\dbinom{4}{1} a^3 b^1 = 4 \\cdot a^3 b\\)\n- When \\(k = 2\\): \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} a^2 b^2 = 6 \\cdot a^2 b^2\\)\n- When \\(k = 3\\): \\(\\dbinom{4}{3} a^1 b^3 = 4 \\cdot a b^3\\)\n- When \\(k = 4\\): \\(\\dbinom{4}{4} a^0 b^4 = 1 \\cdot b^4\\)\n\nSo, in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. Got that part.\n\nNow, moving on to the second part: \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I think I can apply the binomial theorem here as well. Let me write that out.\n\n\\[\n\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\n\\]\n\nSimplifying the exponents, each term becomes:\n\n\\[\n\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\cdot c^{-m} = \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n\\]\n\nSo, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). Now, I need to find the coefficient of a specific term, but wait, in the original problem, we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not involving \\(c\\). Hmm, that's interesting because the second part is in terms of \\(c\\), and the first part is in terms of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). So, when we multiply these two expansions together, each term from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term from the second expansion.\n\nBut since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I think we can consider the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and then multiply it by the entire second expansion, because the second expansion doesn't have any \\(a\\) or \\(b\\) terms. Wait, is that right? Let me think again.\n\nNo, actually, when we multiply two polynomials, each term from the first polynomial is multiplied by each term from the second polynomial. So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I need to find the term(s) in the first expansion that have \\(a^2b^2\\) and then multiply them by all the terms in the second expansion, because the second expansion doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. But since the second expansion is multiplied by each term in the first, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) will actually be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire second expansion.\n\nWait, that might not be correct. Let me clarify. When you have two separate expressions multiplied together, like \\(P(a, b) \\times Q(c)\\), the terms in \\(P(a, b)\\) and \\(Q(c)\\) are independent. So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), it would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(P(a, b)\\) multiplied by the entire expression \\(Q(c)\\), because \\(Q(c)\\) doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. Therefore, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nWait, no, that doesn't seem quite right either. Let me think again. If I have \\(P(a, b) \\times Q(c)\\), then each term in \\(P(a, b)\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(Q(c)\\). So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then I need to find all terms in \\(P(a, b)\\) that have \\(a^2b^2\\) and multiply them by all terms in \\(Q(c)\\), and then sum up those products. But since \\(a^2b^2\\) only comes from one term in \\(P(a, b)\\), which is \\(6a^2b^2\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product will be \\(6 \\times\\) the sum of all coefficients in \\(Q(c)\\). \n\nWait, the sum of all coefficients in \\(Q(c)\\) is obtained by setting \\(c = 1\\) in \\(Q(c)\\). So, let me compute that.\n\nSo, first, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. Now, the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is when \\(c = 1\\). Let me compute that:\n\n\\[\n\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = (1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) would be \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). \n\nWait, but let me verify that. Alternatively, maybe I should think of it as multiplying each term. Let me explain it again more carefully.\n\nWhen I expand \\((a + b)^4\\), I get terms like \\(a^4\\), \\(4a^3b\\), \\(6a^2b^2\\), etc. Then, when I expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), I get terms like \\(c^6\\), \\(6c^4\\), \\(15c^2\\), \\(20\\), \\(15c^{-2}\\), \\(6c^{-4}\\), \\(c^{-6}\\), each multiplied by their respective binomial coefficients.\n\nNow, when I multiply these two expansions together, each term from the first expansion is multiplied by each term from the second expansion. So, for example, \\(a^4\\) from the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, giving terms like \\(a^4c^6\\), \\(4a^4c^4\\), etc. Similarly, \\(4a^3b\\) is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, giving \\(4a^3bc^6\\), \\(16a^3bc^4\\), etc.\n\nBut since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), we need to find all the terms in the product where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2 each. That means we need to look at the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion and multiply it by each term from the second expansion. Each of these products will have the form \\(6a^2b^2 \\times\\) [term from the second expansion].\n\nTherefore, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. Because each term from the second expansion is just a coefficient times some power of \\(c\\), which doesn't affect the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. So, when we collect all the terms with \\(a^2b^2\\), it will be \\(6 \\times\\) (sum of all coefficients in the second expansion).\n\nAs I calculated earlier, the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion is when \\(c = 1\\), which is \\(2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not missing something. Is there a possibility that other terms from the first expansion might contribute to \\(a^2b^2\\) when multiplied by terms from the second expansion? For example, could a term like \\(a^3b\\) from the first expansion, when multiplied by a term from the second expansion that has a negative exponent of \\(c\\), somehow result in \\(a^2b^2\\)? Hmm, no, because the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are fixed in each term. So, \\(a^3b\\) multiplied by any term from the second expansion will still have exponents \\(a^3b^1\\), which can't become \\(a^2b^2\\) unless we have some cancellation or something, which doesn't happen here because we're just multiplying terms, not combining like terms beyond the initial expansion.\n\nTherefore, the only term in the first expansion that contributes to \\(a^2b^2\\) is the \\(6a^2b^2\\) term, and when multiplied by all terms in the second expansion, the coefficient becomes \\(6\\) times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64. So, \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\nWait, but let me confirm this by another approach. Maybe I can compute the entire product and see what the coefficient is, but that might take too long. Alternatively, I can think of the problem as two separate binomial expansions and how they interact.\n\nWait, another thought: the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, when I multiply the two expansions, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will come from \\(6a^2b^2\\) multiplied by each term in the second expansion, each of which has some power of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will indeed be 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, giving 384.\n\nAlternatively, if I wanted to compute the entire expansion, I could note that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, and since the second expansion is multiplied by this term, the entire coefficient becomes 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64. So, 6 times 64 is 384.\n\nWait, but let me just make sure that the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion is indeed 64. The second expansion is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The sum of coefficients is found by substituting \\(c = 1\\), so:\n\n\\[\n\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = (1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\n\\]\n\nYes, that's correct. So, the sum of all coefficients is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because I thought maybe the second expansion would have negative exponents, but since we're multiplying by each term, the coefficients are still positive. So, when I take the sum, it's still 64. So, yes, I think that's correct.\n\nLet me just recap to make sure I didn't miss anything. The first expansion gives me a term \\(6a^2b^2\\). The second expansion, when all coefficients are summed (i.e., when \\(c = 1\\)), is 64. Therefore, the product of these two parts for the \\(a^2b^2\\) term is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\nI don't think I made any mistakes here. So, the coefficient should be 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6. Then, we find the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) by setting \\(c = 1\\), resulting in \\(2^6 = 64\\). Multiplying these together gives \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\(\\boxed{384}\\)."

    "text": " I'm a bit confused, but I'll take it slow.\n\nFirst, I think I should handle each part of the expression separately. The entire expression is a product of two binomial expansions: one is \\((a + b)^4\\) and the other is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So maybe I can expand each part individually and then multiply them together, but I'm not sure if that's the most efficient way. Wait, but the question is specifically asking about the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Hmm, maybe I don't need to expand everything. Let me think.\n\nI remember that when you have a binomial expression like \\((a + b)^n\\), the expansion uses the binomial theorem, which states that each term is of the form \\(\\dbinom{n}{k}a^{n - k}b^k\\). So, for \\((a + b)^4\\), the terms would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{0}a^4b^0\\), \\(\\dbinom{4}{1}a^3b^1\\), \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}a^2b^2\\), and so on, up to \\(\\dbinom{4}{4}a^0b^4\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in this part is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Let me calculate that: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\\). Okay, so the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\nNow, the other part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I'm not sure if I need to consider this part when looking for \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, because the term \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), right? So maybe the coefficient from the second part doesn't affect \\(a^2b^2\\). Hmm, but actually, when we multiply the two expressions together, each term from the first part will be multiplied by each term from the second part. But since the question is only asking about the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), perhaps we can treat the two parts as independent and just multiply the coefficients, but I'm not entirely sure.\n\nWait, no, that doesn't seem right. Let me think again. If I have \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), then when I expand both, each term from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term from the second. So, for example, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion will be multiplied by every term from the second expansion. But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), that would mean that any term in the second expansion that doesn't affect the \\(a^2b^2\\) part would just be multiplied by 1, right? Wait, no, that doesn't make sense. Maybe I'm overcomplicating it.\n\nWait, no, actually, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term is only from the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), and the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), would contribute a term that's separate. So, when you multiply them, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part would be multiplied by each term from the second part. But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I think that would mean that we're only considering the terms where the variables are \\(a^2b^2\\), and any other variables from the second part would just be multiplied along, but perhaps we're looking for the overall coefficient regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. Wait, but that might not make sense because \\(c\\) and \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are different variables. So, actually, maybe the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. But that doesn't seem right either because each term in the product would have a combination of \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\), and \\(1/c\\) terms.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, considering all possible terms, but that seems a bit confusing. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only considering the terms where the variables \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are squared, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, in that case, the coefficient would be the coefficient from the first part, 6, multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part, because each term in the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part. But that would mean the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Hmm, that might be a possibility.\n\nWait, but let me check. If I have \\((a + b)^4\\) times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), then each term in the expansion would be of the form \\(a^kb^{4 - k}\\) times \\(c^m (1/c)^{6 - m}\\), which simplifies to \\(a^kb^{4 - k}c^{m - (6 - m)} = a^kb^{4 - k}c^{2m - 6}\\). So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), that corresponds to \\(k = 2\\), so the term is \\(a^2b^2\\) times whatever comes from the second part. But the second part can have various powers of \\(c\\), so unless the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which would mean that the coefficient would be the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all coefficients in the second part. But that seems a bit odd because then the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion.\n\nWait, let me think again. The sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) would be found by setting \\(c = 1\\). So, substituting \\(c = 1\\), we get \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of the coefficients is 64. Therefore, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, then it would be 6 times 64, which is 384. But I'm not sure if that's the case because the problem didn't specify to ignore the \\(c\\) terms.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me read the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, the problem is asking for the coefficient of the specific term \\(a^2b^2\\), which would come from the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) times the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But in the product, each term from the first expansion is multiplied by each term from the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part would be multiplied by each term from the second part, which includes different powers of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would actually be \\(6\\) times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion because each term from the second expansion is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient would be 6 times 64, which is 384.\n\nWait, but that seems a bit high. Let me check. Alternatively, maybe I'm supposed to consider only the constant term in the second expansion, but I don't think so because the problem didn't specify that. It just says the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would include all possible \\(c\\) terms multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). But actually, when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term from the second expansion, each of those would be a separate term in the product, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion. So, 6 times 64 is 384.\n\nWait, but let me think again. If I have \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), then the expansion would have terms like \\(a^2b^2 \\times c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2 \\times c^4\\), etc., each with their own coefficients. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^6\\) would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^6\\) in the second expansion, and similarly for other powers of \\(c\\). But the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), without specifying any particular power of \\(c\\). So, does that mean that we're supposed to consider all possible powers of \\(c\\) and sum up the coefficients? That is, the total coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\)'s exponent would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 times 64, which is 384.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is only considering the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by 1, i.e., the constant term in the second expansion. So, let me check what the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is. The general term in the expansion is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - k} \\times (1/c)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, the exponent of \\(c\\) is \\(6 - 2k\\). We want the exponent to be zero for the constant term, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\). So, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times the constant term, then the coefficient would be 6 times 20, which is 120.\n\nWait, but now I'm confused. Which interpretation is correct? The problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", but it doesn't specify any power of \\(c\\). So, perhaps it's expecting the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 times 64, which is 384. Alternatively, maybe it's expecting the coefficient when combined with the constant term, which would be 120.\n\nWait, but in the product, each term from the first expansion is multiplied by each term from the second, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the sum over all possible coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by 6. So, if I think of it as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, that would include all possible \\(c\\) terms, so the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 times 64, which is 384. But I'm not sure if that's what the problem is asking for.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, considering that each term in the product is a combination of \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\), and \\(1/c\\). So, if we're looking for the term where the variables are exactly \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, then that would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 384. But I'm not entirely sure.\n\nWait, let me think about how coefficients work in products. When you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum of the products of the coefficients of terms that multiply together to give that specific term. So, in this case, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product can be obtained by multiplying \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion with any term from the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. Because each term in the second expansion contributes a factor that, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), gives a term in the product. So, the total coefficient would be 6 times 64, which is 384.\n\nWait, but that seems a bit counterintuitive because the second expansion includes terms with different powers of \\(c\\), so I'm not sure if they should all be included when considering the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, in that case, yes, it would be 6 times 64, which is 384.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is more straightforward. Maybe it's just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion, which is 6, and the second expansion is irrelevant because the problem is only about \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). But that doesn't seem right because the entire expression is the product of both expansions. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would involve both parts.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Let me try to write it out more formally.\n\nLet me denote the first part as \\(P = (a + b)^4\\) and the second part as \\(Q = \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Then, the product is \\(P \\times Q\\).\n\nThe expansion of \\(P\\) is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^4 \\dbinom{4}{k}a^{4 - k}b^k\\), and the expansion of \\(Q\\) is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^6 \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - m}\\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^6 \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\).\n\nNow, when we multiply \\(P\\) and \\(Q\\), each term in \\(P\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(Q\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(P\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\\). Now, when we multiply this by each term in \\(Q\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\), we get terms like \\(6 \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}a^2b^2c^{6 - 2m}\\).\n\nBut the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Now, in the product \\(P \\times Q\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) can be combined with any power of \\(c\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually be the sum of all coefficients from \\(Q\\) multiplied by the coefficient from \\(P\\). That is, 6 times the sum of the coefficients in \\(Q\\). The sum of the coefficients in \\(Q\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), so \\(Q(1) = (1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\nWait, but earlier I thought maybe the problem was asking for the coefficient when multiplied by the constant term in \\(Q\\), which would be 20, leading to 6 times 20, which is 120. But now, after thinking more carefully, I think the correct approach is that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(Q\\), which is 64, so 6 times 64 is 384.\n\nWait, but let me verify this with a simpler example to make sure I'm not making a mistake. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Let's compute this manually.\n\nFirst, \\((a + b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2\\).\n\nSecond, \\((c + 1/c)^1 = c + 1/c\\).\n\nMultiplying them together:\n\n\\(a^2(c + 1/c) + 2ab(c + 1/c) + b^2(c + 1/c)\\)\n\nWhich is:\n\n\\(a^2c + a^2/c + 2abc + 2ab/c + b^2c + b^2/c\\).\n\nNow, if I look for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but in this product, there are no \\(a^2b^2\\) terms because the highest power of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) in each term is 2, but they are multiplied by different powers of \\(c\\). Wait, but in this case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually be zero because there are no such terms. Hmm, but according to my earlier reasoning, the coefficient should be 2 (from \\((a + b)^2\\)) times the sum of coefficients in \\((c + 1/c)^1\\), which is 2, so 2 times 2 is 4. But in reality, the product doesn't have any \\(a^2b^2\\) terms. So, that suggests that my earlier reasoning is incorrect.\n\nWait, that's a problem. So, in this example, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is zero, but according to my earlier logic, it should be 4. That means I must have made a mistake.\n\nWait, so perhaps I'm misunderstanding how the coefficients work. Let me think again.\n\nIn the example, \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\), the product has terms like \\(a^2c\\), \\(a^2/c\\), \\(2abc\\), \\(2ab/c\\), \\(b^2c\\), \\(b^2/c\\). So, none of these terms have both \\(a^2\\) and \\(b^2\\) because each term comes from multiplying one term from \\((a + b)^2\\) with one term from \\((c + 1/c)^1\\). So, each term in the product can have either \\(a^2\\) or \\(b^2\\), but not both at the same time. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is zero.\n\nWait, so that means that in the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\times (c + 1/c)^6\\) would actually be zero because you can't have both \\(a^2b^2\\) and any power of \\(c\\) in the same term. Because each term in the product is a combination of a term from the first expansion and a term from the second expansion, which include different variables. So, the only way to get a term with \\(a^2b^2\\) is if the term from the second expansion is 1, i.e., the constant term. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient from the first expansion times the constant term from the second expansion.\n\nAh, that makes more sense. So, in the example, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is zero because there's no constant term in the second expansion to pair with \\(a^2b^2\\). But in the original problem, the second expansion does have a constant term, so the coefficient would be non-zero.\n\nWait, so in the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient from the first expansion times the constant term from the second expansion. So, that would be 6 times 20, which is 120.\n\nWait, let me confirm that with the example. If I had \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^2\\), then the second expansion would have a constant term. Let me compute that.\n\nFirst, \\((a + b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2\\).\n\nSecond, \\((c + 1/c)^2 = c^2 + 2 + 1/c^2\\).\n\nMultiplying them together:\n\n\\(a^2(c^2 + 2 + 1/c^2) + 2ab(c^2 + 2 + 1/c^2) + b^2(c^2 + 2 + 1/c^2)\\).\n\nWhich expands to:\n\n\\(a^2c^2 + 2a^2 + a^2/c^2 + 2ab c^2 + 4ab + 2ab/c^2 + b^2c^2 + 2b^2 + b^2/c^2\\).\n\nNow, looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Hmm, wait, there are no \\(a^2b^2\\) terms here because each term has either \\(a^2\\), \\(ab\\), or \\(b^2\\), but not both \\(a^2\\) and \\(b^2\\) together. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is zero. Wait, but that's confusing because the second expansion has a constant term. So, maybe my earlier conclusion is incorrect.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is that in order to get \\(a^2b^2\\), you need to multiply a term with \\(a^2\\) by a term with \\(b^2\\), but in the product, each term comes from multiplying a term from the first expansion by a term from the second expansion. So, unless the second expansion has a term that is 1, i.e., the constant term, you can't get \\(a^2b^2\\) because each term from the first expansion is multiplied by a term that has \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), which introduces other variables.\n\nWait, but in the example I just did, \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^2\\), the product includes a term \\(2a^2\\) and a term \\(4ab\\) and a term \\(2b^2\\), but no \\(a^2b^2\\) term. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is zero. So, even though the second expansion has a constant term, the first expansion doesn't have a term that would allow \\(a^2b^2\\) when multiplied by the constant term. Because in the first expansion, \\((a + b)^2\\), the highest degree terms are \\(a^2\\), \\(2ab\\), and \\(b^2\\), none of which are \\(a^2b^2\\).\n\nWait, so perhaps in the original problem, \\((a + b)^4\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) exists, and when multiplied by the constant term from the second expansion, which is 20, gives a term \\(6 \\times 20 a^2b^2\\), so the coefficient would be 120.\n\nBut in the example, \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^2\\), the first expansion doesn't have an \\(a^2b^2\\) term, so the coefficient remains zero, even though the second expansion has a constant term. So, in the original problem, since the first expansion does have an \\(a^2b^2\\) term, and the second expansion has a constant term, then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times 20, which is 120.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought that the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, but that seems to have led to a contradiction in the example. So, perhaps the correct approach is that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient from the first expansion times the constant term from the second expansion. So, 6 times 20 is 120.\n\nWait, let me check another example to be sure. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^3 \\times (c + 1/c)^3\\). The first expansion is \\(a^3 + 3a^2b + 3ab^2 + b^3\\). The second expansion is \\(c^3 + 3c + 3/c + 1/c^3\\). Now, the product would include terms like \\(a^3c^3\\), \\(3a^3c\\), etc., but also terms like \\(3a^2b \\times 3c = 9a^2bc\\), and so on. Now, is there a term with \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product? Let's see: To get \\(a^2b^2\\), we would need to multiply a term with \\(a^2b\\) by a term with \\(ab\\), but that's not possible because each term from the first expansion is multiplied by a term from the second expansion, which only has \\(c\\) terms. So, the product can't have a term with both \\(a^2b^2\\) and some power of \\(c\\) because each term in the product is a combination of a term from the first and a term from the second. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be zero because there's no way to combine terms from both expansions to get \\(a^2b^2\\).\n\nWait, but in this case, the first expansion has \\(a^2b\\) and \\(ab^2\\), but not \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is zero. So, that suggests that in order to have a non-zero coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, the first expansion must have a term \\(a^2b^2\\) and the second expansion must have a term that is 1, i.e., the constant term. So, the coefficient would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion times the constant term in the second expansion.\n\nTherefore, in the original problem, since the first expansion has \\(a^2b^2\\) with coefficient 6, and the second expansion has a constant term with coefficient 20, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times 20, which is 120.\n\nWait, that seems consistent with the examples I've tried. So, the key point is that in order to have a term with \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, you have to multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first expansion by the constant term from the second expansion. All other terms from the second expansion would introduce a power of \\(c\\), which would prevent the product term from being just \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient is 6 times 20, which is 120.\n\nSo, to recap:\n\n1. Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n\n2. Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) and find the constant term, which is when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. This occurs when \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), so \\(k = 3\\). The coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n\n3. Multiply these two coefficients together because the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion is multiplied by the constant term from the second expansion, resulting in \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break down the problem into two parts using the binomial theorem.\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   The general term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is given by:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{k}a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   We are interested in the term where \\(k = 2\\), which is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2}a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\n   \\]\n   Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\n2. **Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) and find the constant term:**\n   The general term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is given by:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - m}\\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\n   \\]\n   We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, which occurs when:\n   \\[\n   6 - 2m = 0 \\implies m = 3\n   \\]\n   The constant term is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\n   \\]\n\n3. **Combine the results:**\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is the product of the coefficients from each part:\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 20 = 120\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

    "text": " \n\nFirst, I know that when you expand a binomial like \\((a + b)^n\\), you can use the binomial theorem. The binomial theorem states that \\((a + b)^n = \\sum_{k=0}^{n} \\dbinom{n}{k} a^{n - k} b^{k}\\). So, maybe I can apply that here for the \\((a + b)^4\\) part.\n\nAlright, so let's focus on \\((a + b)^4\\) first. I need the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Using the binomial theorem, the general term is \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k} b^{k}\\). I want the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2. That means \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). So, the coefficient would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\).\n\nCalculating that, \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. Got that part.\n\nNow, the expression also has another part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Hmm, so I'm supposed to multiply the two parts together. But wait, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which only involves \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). The other part has \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), so maybe those terms don't affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)? Or do they?\n\nWait, no. Because when you multiply two expressions, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression. So, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part will get multiplied by every term in the second part. But the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. Hmm, so does that mean that the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)? That doesn't seem right because the problem is probably expecting a numerical coefficient, not a polynomial.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\) because otherwise, the term would involve \\(c\\) to some power. So, maybe I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by the term where \\(c\\) cancels out, i.e., \\(c^0\\), so that the entire term is just a constant multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\).\n\nWait, that makes sense. Because if I just take the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part, it's 6\\(a^2b^2\\), and then I have to multiply it by the entire second part, which includes terms with various powers of \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which probably means considering all the terms in the product that result in \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. Hmm, but that's not possible because when you multiply, each term from the first part gets multiplied by each term from the second part, so the \\(a^2b^2\\) term would be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, unless the problem is considering the entire expression as a polynomial in \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\), and it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which would make the coefficient a polynomial in \\(c\\). But that seems complicated, and I don't think that's what the problem is asking for.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, so the coefficient would be a term that includes powers of \\(c\\). But that seems a bit odd because the problem didn't specify any particular power of \\(c\\). Hmm.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again. The problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product of the two expansions. So, perhaps I need to consider that when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by every term in the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would actually be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make much sense because coefficients are usually constants, not variables. So, maybe I'm approaching this wrong.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some \\(k\\), but it's just written as \\(a^2b^2\\). Hmm, but the problem didn't specify any \\(c\\) terms, so maybe I'm supposed to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which would mean adding up all the coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by 6. But that seems like the total coefficient when you sum over all possible \\(c\\) terms, which might not make sense.\n\nWait, no, perhaps the problem is simply to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable, so the coefficient would be 6 times the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which would be a polynomial in \\(c\\). But that seems complicated, and I'm not sure if that's the right approach.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is expecting me to consider that the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by the constant term of the second expansion, which is when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. So, perhaps I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) and then multiply that by 6.\n\nYes, that makes sense. Because if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), then I need to multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part by the constant term (i.e., the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero) from the second part. So, the coefficient would be 6 times the constant term of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nAlright, so let's try that approach. First, I'll find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). To do that, I can use the binomial theorem again. The general term in the expansion is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\).\n\nI need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be zero for the constant term, so I set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\).\n\nCalculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). Wait, no, that can't be right because 6! is 720, and 3! is 6, so 6!/(3!3!) = 720/(6\u00d76) = 720/36 = 20. So, the constant term is 20.\n\nSo, the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the second part), which is 6 \u00d7 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\) with coefficient 6, and the constant term from the other part is 20, so when you multiply them, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\) is 6 \u00d7 20 = 120. So, the coefficient is 120.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, then technically, the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that doesn't make sense because coefficients are usually constants, not polynomials. So, I think the correct approach is to consider the constant term in the second expansion and multiply it by the coefficient from the first part, giving 120.\n\nLet me double-check my steps. First, I found the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6. Then, I found the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20. Multiplying them gives 120. That seems correct.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Is the problem asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which would include all possible terms from the second expansion? So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which seems odd because the problem didn't specify any particular power of \\(c\\). So, perhaps the problem is only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the constant term. That would make sense, so the coefficient is 120.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is expecting me to consider that the entire expression is a product of two polynomials, and the term \\(a^2b^2\\) can be combined with any term from the second expansion, so the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. But the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) would be found by setting \\(c = 1\\), so \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). So, 6 \u00d7 64 = 384. But that seems different from what I got earlier.\n\nWait, but that would be the case if the problem was asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), which would mean summing over all possible \\(c\\) terms. But I think the problem is more likely asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nWait, let me check: if I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\), so the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion is 64. Then, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 \u00d7 64 = 384. But that seems too high, and I'm not sure if that's what the problem is asking for.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it, and the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which would mean 6 \u00d7 \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that would make the coefficient a polynomial, which doesn't seem right.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when considering the entire expression as a polynomial in \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\), so the coefficient would be 6 times the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems like the coefficient is a polynomial, which is probably not what the problem is asking for. It's more likely that the problem wants a numerical coefficient, so I think I should go back to the original approach.\n\nSo, to recap: the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) has a coefficient of 6. The term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) that doesn't involve \\(c\\) (i.e., the constant term) is 20. Therefore, when you multiply these two parts together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) (with no \\(c\\) terms) is 6 \u00d7 20 = 120.\n\nI think that's the correct approach. So, the coefficient is 120.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me think about how the product works. When you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part is multiplied by every term in the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean that the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the problem is just asking for a coefficient, which is usually a number.\n\nSo, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable, and the coefficient can include powers of \\(c\\). But that seems unusual because coefficients are typically constants. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be 120, as I calculated earlier.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is miswritten, and it's supposed to be \\((a + b + c + 1/c)^6\\) or something like that, but as it stands, it's \\((a + b)^4 \\times (c + 1/c)^6\\).\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is expecting me to consider that the entire expression is a product, and the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which would be a polynomial. But the problem didn't specify any particular power of \\(c\\), so maybe I'm supposed to consider the coefficient as a polynomial.\n\nBut that seems unlikely because the problem is asking for the coefficient, not the coefficient times something else. So, I think the correct approach is to consider that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times the constant term in the second expansion, which is 20, so 6 \u00d7 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but let me think again. If I have \\((a + b)^4\\) times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), then the product will have terms like \\(a^kb^{4 - k}c^m\\) where \\(k\\) ranges from 0 to 4 and \\(m\\) ranges over some integers. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^m\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would actually be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would include all the \\(c\\) terms, so that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, which is probably not intended.\n\nTherefore, I think the problem is more likely asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where \\(c\\) cancels out. So, in that case, the coefficient is 6 \u00d7 20 = 120.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is simply expecting me to compute the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and ignore the second part, but that seems incorrect because the second part is part of the product.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is written as \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), and it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. But that would mean that the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which is unusual. So, maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when \\(c\\) is set to 1, but that's not specified.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is just a misstatement, and it's supposed to be \\((a + b + c + 1/c)^6\\), but as it is, I have to work with \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\).\n\nWait, perhaps another approach is to consider that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, so the coefficient would be 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but that seems like the coefficient is a polynomial, which is probably not what the problem is asking for. So, I think the intended answer is 120, considering the constant term in the second expansion.\n\nLet me just confirm that the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is indeed 20. Using the binomial theorem, the general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\times \\left(1/c\\right)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). Setting the exponent to zero, \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), so \\(k = 3\\), and the term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, yes, that's correct.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 \u00d7 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but let me think again. If I have \\((a + b)^4\\) times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), then the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which is not a constant. So, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is expecting me to consider that the entire expression is a product, and the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. The sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), so \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, 6 \u00d7 64 = 384. But that seems different from the 120 I calculated earlier.\n\nWait, but that would be the case if the problem was asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), which would mean adding up all the coefficients from the second expansion. But that's not what the problem is asking for. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which likely refers to the term \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by the constant term from the second expansion, giving 120.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting me to consider that the term \\(a^2b^2\\) can be combined with any term from the second expansion, so the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion, but that seems incorrect because the coefficient should be a constant, not a polynomial.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is miswritten, and it's supposed to be \\((a + b + c + 1/c)^6\\), but as it stands, it's two separate binomials multiplied together. So, I think the correct approach is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nLet me just go through the steps again to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\n1. Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n\n2. Expand \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem. The general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\times (1/c)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\).\n\n3. To find the constant term (where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero), set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), so \\(k = 3\\). The constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n\n4. Multiply the two coefficients: 6 \u00d7 20 = 120.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 120.\n\nI think that makes sense. So, the final answer should be 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is found by considering the product of the coefficients from each binomial expansion. \n\n1. From \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n\n2. From \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the constant term (where \\(c^0\\)) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n\nMultiplying these gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\boxed{120}."

So, the coefficient here would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\).\n\nCalculating \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\), which is \\(\\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient from the first part is 6. \n\nNow, moving on to the second part: \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I need to figure out what to do with this. Wait, but the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which only involves \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). The second part involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), so maybe their exponents don't affect the \\(a^2b^2\\) term? Or perhaps I'm misunderstanding something.\n\nWait, no, actually, the entire expression is the product of \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when I multiply these two expansions together, each term from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term from the second expansion. But since I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I can treat the \\(c\\) terms separately because they won't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) exponents.\n\nWait, that might not be right. Let me think again. When I multiply two terms, one from each expansion, the variables multiply. So, if I have a term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part and any term from the second part, the variables will be \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by some combination of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, actually, the \\(c\\) terms can be anything, but the \\(a^2b^2\\) part is fixed. Therefore, the coefficient will be the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part, because every term in the second expansion will be multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), contributing to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the overall product.\n\nWait, no, that doesn't seem right either. Because when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, if I have a term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part, it will be multiplied by every term in the second expansion, which includes various powers of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, I just need to find how many times \\(a^2b^2\\) appears when multiplied by any term from the second expansion. Wait, but actually, no. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by every term in the second expansion, each of which has different powers of \\(c\\). So, in the product, each term will be of the form \\(a^2b^2 \\times c^k \\times (1/c)^m\\), but the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be the sum of the coefficients from all the terms in the second expansion, each multiplied by the coefficient from the first part.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think differently. Since I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, it's equivalent to taking the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and multiplying it by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't seem right because the entire expansion would include multiple terms, each contributing to different coefficients in the product.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the question. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\).\" So, the expression is a product of two polynomials, one in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the other in \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, when you multiply them, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. But the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient from the first part (\\(a^2b^2\\)) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients from the second part, because each term in the second part is a coefficient times a power of \\(c\\), but since we're only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, the coefficient would just be the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all coefficients in the second part.\n\nWait, but that doesn't make sense because the second part is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). The sum of all coefficients in this expansion would be found by setting \\(c = 1\\), so \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of coefficients is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 (from the first part) times 64 (sum of coefficients in the second part), which would be 384.\n\nWait, but that seems too straightforward. Let me check if that's correct. Alternatively, maybe I'm supposed to consider that when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the \\(a^2b^2\\) term is only affected by the constant term in the second expansion, but that doesn't seem right because the second expansion doesn't have a constant term. Let me check: \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). When expanded, the general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} (1/c)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, the exponent of \\(c\\) is \\(6 - 2k\\). For the term to be a constant (i.e., \\(c^0\\)), we need \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n\nWait, so if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, it's the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by the constant term, you get \\(a^2b^2 \\times 20\\), which is part of the overall product. But wait, actually, no. Because when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), every term in the first expansion is multiplied by every term in the second. So, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part is multiplied by all the terms in the second part, each of which has some power of \\(c\\). So, in the product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), \\(a^2b^2c^{k-1}\\), etc. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. Wait, but that's not possible because each term in the product will have both \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) exponents and some \\(c\\) exponents. So, perhaps the question is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\). That makes more sense because otherwise, if you just want \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), that would be the sum of all coefficients where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any power of \\(c\\), which would be the coefficient from the first part times the entire sum of the second part, which is 64. But I think the question is more likely asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2 each, and the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0.\n\nSo, to clarify, the problem is probably asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product. Therefore, I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\).\n\nFrom earlier, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. Now, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). As I calculated before, this is the term where \\(k = 3\\), so the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. When I multiply the two expansions, each term from \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part. The only term in the second part that will result in \\(c^0\\) is the constant term, which is 20. Therefore, the only contribution to \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is 6 * 20 = 120. All other terms would have some power of \\(c\\), so they wouldn't contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\).\n\nAlternatively, if the problem was asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, then it would be 6 * (sum of coefficients in the second expansion) = 6 * 64 = 384. But I think that's not the case because usually, when a problem asks for a coefficient in a product of multiple variables, it's specifying all the exponents, including any that might be zero if they're part of the term. So, in this case, I think the problem is asking for the coefficient where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present, and the \\(c\\) terms cancel out to \\(c^0\\).\n\nWait, but let me check the problem again: it says, \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\". So, it's just \\(a^2b^2\\), without any \\(c\\) terms. So, in the product, \\(a^2b^2\\) can be multiplied by any term from the second expansion, which includes \\(c^k\\) for various \\(k\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, each term contributes its coefficient to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of the \\(c\\) exponents.\n\nWait, that seems contradictory to my earlier thought. Let me clarify: when you have two polynomials multiplied together, say \\(P(a, b)\\) and \\(Q(c)\\), then the coefficient of a specific term in \\(P(a, b)\\) times the entire polynomial \\(Q(c)\\) would be the coefficient of that term in \\(P(a, b)\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(Q(c)\\). Because each term in \\(Q(c)\\) is a coefficient times some power of \\(c\\), so when you multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), you get terms like \\(a^2b^2 \\times \\text{coefficient}_k \\times c^{k}\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the sum over all \\(k\\) of \\(\\text{coefficient}_k\\) from \\(Q(c)\\) times the coefficient from \\(P(a, b)\\).\n\nWait, but that would mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 * (sum of coefficients in \\(Q(c)\\)). The sum of coefficients in \\(Q(c)\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), so \\(Q(1) = (1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient would be 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nBut earlier, I thought it was 120, assuming that we're looking for \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). So, which is it?\n\nWait, the problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\". So, in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would appear in the product as \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Each of these terms has a coefficient, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient from the first part (6) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients from the second part (64). Therefore, the coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nBut wait, that seems to contradict the idea that each term in the product has specific exponents for all variables. So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the exponent of \\(c\\), then yes, it's 384. But if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it's 120.\n\nI need to clarify which interpretation is correct. The problem says: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\).\" It doesn't specify anything about \\(c\\), so I think it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). Therefore, it's the sum of all coefficients where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any power of \\(c\\). So, that would be 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nBut wait, another way to think about it is that when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the product has specific exponents for all variables. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) could be multiplied by \\(c^k\\) for various \\(k\\), each contributing to a different term in the product. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the sum of all coefficients from the second polynomial, because each term in the second polynomial, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), contributes to a term with \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), and the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) (regardless of \\(c\\)) would be the sum of all these coefficients.\n\nWait, but that seems a bit odd because in the product, each term is a product of terms from both polynomials, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would indeed be the coefficient from the first part times the sum of coefficients from the second part. So, 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nBut earlier, I thought it was 120, assuming that we're looking for \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). So, which is correct? Let me think about it another way.\n\nSuppose I set \\(c = 1\\). Then the second part becomes \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). The entire expression becomes \\((a + b)^4 * 64\\). The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in this would be 6 * 64 = 384. So, if I set \\(c = 1\\), I'm effectively summing all the coefficients of the second part, which gives me the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product as 384.\n\nAlternatively, if I want the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), I need to find the term where \\(c^0\\) is present, which is 20, so 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nSo, the problem is ambiguous in that sense. But given that it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without specifying anything about \\(c\\), I think it's more likely that it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which would be 384.\n\nWait, but let me check the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, it's in the product of these two expressions. Since the product includes terms with various powers of \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the sum of all coefficients from the second part multiplied by the coefficient from the first part. So, 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nBut I'm a bit confused because in the problem statement, the variables are separate. So, maybe the problem is considering the entire product and asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, that would mean 384.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem was asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), it would be 120.\n\nHmm, I'm not sure. Let me try to see if there's another way to approach this.\n\nAnother approach: The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). We can think of this as a product of two independent expansions. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Because each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but I'm not entirely confident. Let me think of a simpler example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^1 (c + 1/c)^1\\). The expansion would be \\((a + b)(c + 1/c)\\). The coefficient of \\(a^1b^0\\) would be the coefficient of \\(a\\) in the first part (which is 1) multiplied by the sum of coefficients in the second part (which is \\(1 + 1 = 2\\)), so 1 * 2 = 2. Alternatively, if I look for the coefficient of \\(a^1b^0c^0\\), it would be 1 * 1 = 1. So, depending on whether I include the \\(c\\) terms or not, the coefficient changes.\n\nIn the original problem, since the question is only about \\(a^2b^2\\), without mentioning \\(c\\), I think it's referring to the coefficient regardless of \\(c\\), which would be 384. But I'm not 100% sure. Alternatively, maybe the problem expects me to consider that the \\(c\\) terms are separate, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just 6, but that doesn't make sense because the entire expression includes both parts.\n\nWait, no, because the entire expression is a product, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 multiplied by the entire second expansion, but that's not how it works. Each term in the product is a combination of terms from both expansions. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the coefficient from the first part times the sum of coefficients from the second part.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should think of it as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the sum of coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nBut let me try another approach. Let's expand both parts and see.\n\nFirst, \\((a + b)^4\\) expansion:\n\n- \\(a^4\\): coefficient 1\n- \\(a^3b\\): coefficient 4\n- \\(a^2b^2\\): coefficient 6\n- \\(a b^3\\): coefficient 4\n- \\(b^4\\): coefficient 1\n\nNow, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) expansion:\n\nThe general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} (1/c)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\).\n\nSo, the exponents of \\(c\\) will be 6, 4, 2, 0, -2, -4, -6 as \\(k\\) goes from 0 to 6.\n\nThe coefficients for each term are:\n\n- \\(k=0\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{0} = 1\\), term \\(c^6\\)\n- \\(k=1\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{1} = 6\\), term \\(c^4\\)\n- \\(k=2\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{2} = 15\\), term \\(c^2\\)\n- \\(k=3\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\), term \\(c^0\\)\n- \\(k=4\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{4} = 15\\), term \\(c^{-2}\\)\n- \\(k=5\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{5} = 6\\), term \\(c^{-4}\\)\n- \\(k=6\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{6} = 1\\), term \\(c^{-6}\\)\n\nSo, the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion is \\(1 + 6 + 15 + 20 + 15 + 6 + 1 = 64\\), which matches the earlier calculation.\n\nNow, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part (which is 6) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part (which is 64), giving 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 384.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it might be 120 if we're considering \\(c^0\\). But the problem didn't specify anything about \\(c\\), so I think 384 is the correct answer.\n\nLet me just confirm with another example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^2 (c + 1/c)^1\\). The expansion would be \\((a^2 + 2ab + b^2)(c + 1/c)\\). The coefficient of \\(ab\\) would be 2 * (1 + 1) = 4, because each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the coefficient of \\(ab\\) is 2 * 2 = 4. But if I were to look for the coefficient of \\(ab c^0\\), it would be 2 * 1 = 2, because only the constant term in the second expansion contributes to \\(c^0\\).\n\nIn our original problem, since the question is only about \\(a^2b^2\\), without any restriction on \\(c\\), it's like the first example, where we're summing over all \\(c\\) terms, so the coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but in the first example, the coefficient of \\(ab\\) is 4, which is 2 * 2, where 2 is the coefficient from the first part and 2 is the sum of coefficients from the second part (1 + 1). So, applying the same logic, in our problem, it's 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nTherefore, I think the answer is 384.\n\nBut wait, let me check again. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. So, when we multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients from the second part. So, yes, 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem had asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), it would be 6 * 20 = 120. But since it's just \\(a^2b^2\\), I think it's 384.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because when you have multiple variables, the coefficient of a term like \\(a^2b^2\\) would include all possible coefficients from the other variables, so it's the product of the coefficients from each part. But in this case, since the other part is a separate variable, \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would indeed be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second part, which is 64, giving 384.\n\nWait, but let me think about it differently. If I have two polynomials, P and Q, and I multiply them, then the coefficient of a term in P times the entire Q would be the coefficient in P times the sum of coefficients in Q. So, yes, that makes sense.\n\nTherefore, I think the answer is 384.\n\nBut wait, let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. Let me try to write out the product:\n\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\n\\]\n\\[\n\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15c^{-2} + 6c^{-4} + c^{-6}\n\\]\n\nNow, when I multiply these two, each term in the first will be multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) from the first will be multiplied by each term in the second, resulting in:\n\n\\(6a^2b^2c^6 + 36a^2b^2c^4 + 90a^2b^2c^2 + 120a^2b^2 + 90a^2b^2c^{-2} + 36a^2b^2c^{-4} + 6a^2b^2c^{-6}\\)\n\nSo, in the product, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^6\\) is 6, \\(a^2b^2c^4\\) is 36, \\(a^2b^2c^2\\) is 90, \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is 120, and so on. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\) would be the sum of all these coefficients, which is 6 + 36 + 90 + 120 + 90 + 36 + 6 = let's calculate that:\n\n6 + 36 = 42\n42 + 90 = 132\n132 + 120 = 252\n252 + 90 = 342\n342 + 36 = 378\n378 + 6 = 384\n\nSo, the sum is indeed 384. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 384.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem had asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), it would be 120. But since it's just \\(a^2b^2\\), the answer is 384.\n\nWait, but let me check the problem again: it says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\". So, yes, it's 384.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because in the expansion, each term has specific exponents for \\(c\\), so when we talk about the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), it's actually a sum over all possible \\(c\\) exponents. So, the answer is 384.\n\nI think that's the correct approach. So, the coefficient is 384.\n\nBut wait, let me make sure I didn't make any calculation mistakes. Let me recalculate the sum:\n\nFrom the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the coefficients are 1, 6, 15, 20, 15, 6, 1. Sum is 1+6=7, 7+15=22, 22+20=42, 42+15=57, 57+6=63, 63+1=64. So, sum is 64.\n\nThen, 6 * 64 = 384. So, yes, that's correct.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 384.\n\nWait, but earlier when I thought it was 120, I was considering only the constant term in the second expansion. But now, after expanding, I see that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by 6, which is 384.\n\nSo, I think that's the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break down the problem into two parts.\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   The term containing \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient is 6.\n\n2. **Consider \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   The sum of all coefficients in this expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), giving \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\).\n\n3. **Combine the results:**\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient from the first part (6) multiplied by the sum of coefficients from the second part (64), resulting in \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{384}\\)."
