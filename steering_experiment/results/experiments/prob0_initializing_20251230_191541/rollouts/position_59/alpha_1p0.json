    "text": " \n\nWait, but hold on, I just realized something. The problem is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but when I expand this, each term from \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by every term in the second part, but only the term with \\(c^0\\) will result in a term that's just \\(a^2b^2\\). All other terms would have some power of \\(c\\) attached, which we don't want. So, the coefficient is indeed the product of the two coefficients, which is 6 * 20 = 120. So, I think I'm confident that 120 is the correct answer.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Is there a possibility that other terms in the expansion could contribute to \\(a^2b^2\\) without involving \\(c\\)? For example, if there's a term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) that's \\(c^k \\times 1/c^k = c^0\\), but that's the same as the constant term. So, I think that's the only term that would contribute to \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. So, yeah, 120 is correct.\n\nAnother way to think about it: The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, when you expand both parts, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6a\u00b2b\u00b2, and it's multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But only the term that has \\(c^0\\) will result in a term without \\(c\\), which is 20. So, 6a\u00b2b\u00b2 * 20 = 120a\u00b2b\u00b2. Therefore, the coefficient is 120.\n\nI think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning.

Using the binomial theorem, I found that the coefficient for \\(c^0\\) is 20. Multiplying these two coefficients together gives 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nI don't think I made any mistakes here.

So, the way I approached it was by considering that the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the product of the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first polynomial and the constant term in the second polynomial. But is that the only way to get a term with \\(a^2b^2\\)? Let me think. Suppose I took a term from \\((a + b)^4\\) with \\(a^k b^{4 - k}\\) and a term from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) with \\(c^m\\). When I multiply them together, the resulting term would be \\(a^k b^{4 - k} c^m\\). But since we're looking for a term with \\(a^2b^2\\), that means \\(k = 2\\) and \\(4 - k = 2\\), so \\(k = 2\\). Therefore, the term from the first polynomial is \\(6a^2b^2\\). Now, the term from the second polynomial must be \\(c^0\\) because if it's \\(c^m\\) where \\(m \\neq 0\\), then the entire product would have a \\(c^m\\) term, which would make it not just \\(a^2b^2\\).

    "text": " \n\nWait, hold on, I just realized something. The problem is written as \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When expanding this, each term from \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the product of the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in \\((a + b)^4\\) and the term with \\(c^0\\) in the other expansion. So, that part is correct. But wait, let me check if the exponents in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) can affect the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. For example, if I take a term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) that has \\(c^k\\), then when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), it would result in a term \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), which is different from \\(a^2b^2\\). So, only the term with \\(c^0\\) would contribute to \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, my initial approach is correct. So, the coefficient is indeed 120.\n\nBut wait, just to make sure, let me think again. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, in the product, any term that has \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by any power of \\(c\\) would still have \\(a^2b^2\\) as part of it, but the coefficient would be the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times the coefficient of the corresponding \\(c\\) term. However, since the question is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), it's considering all terms that have exactly \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. Wait, no, that's not right. Because in the product, each term is a product of a term from \\((a + b)^4\\) and a term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, for the term \\(a^2b^2\\), it can only come from multiplying \\(a^2b^2\\) by \\(c^0\\), because any other term from the second expansion would introduce a \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\) term, making the term have \\(c\\) in it. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is just the product of the coefficients from each part, as I thought before. So, 6 times 20 is 120. Therefore, the answer is 120.\n\nWait, but let me think about it another way. Suppose I expand both expressions fully and then look for the term \\(a^2b^2\\). In \\((a + b)^4\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(6a^2b^2\\). In \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term with \\(c^0\\) is \\(20\\). So, when I multiply these two, it's \\(6a^2b^2 \\times 20 = 120a^2b^2\\). So, yes, the coefficient is 120. Alternatively, if I think of the entire product as a polynomial in \\(a, b, c\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) can only come from multiplying \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part and \\(c^0\\) from the second part. So, the coefficient is indeed 6 times 20, which is 120.\n\nI think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning. So, the final answer is 120.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break down the problem into two parts using the binomial theorem.\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\)**:\n   Using the binomial theorem, the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is:\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\):\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\n   \\]\n   So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\n2. **Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)**:\n   Using the binomial theorem, the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is:\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n   \\]\n   We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0:\n   \\[\n   6 - 2m = 0 \\implies m = 3\n   \\]\n   The coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\n   \\]\n\n3. **Combine the coefficients**:\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficients from each part:\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 20 = 120\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."
