So, when I multiply these two expressions, the terms are combined. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\) and the term \\(c^0\\) comes from the other polynomial. But actually, when you multiply two polynomials, each term from the first is multiplied by each term from the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first polynomial is multiplied by every term from the second polynomial, but only the term with \\(c^0\\) will result in a term that is \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms. All other terms from the second polynomial will introduce a \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\) term, so they won't affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient is indeed the product of the coefficients from each part, which is 6 * 20 = 120. So, I think I was correct the first time. But just to make sure, let me consider an alternative approach. Suppose I expand both expressions separately and then multiply them.

However, only the term \\(20\\) (the constant term) will result in a term that is \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms. All other terms would have \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), so they wouldn't contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Yep, that confirms it.

So, yes, 6 * 20 = 120 is correct. So, I think my initial conclusion was right. But just to be thorough, let me consider the entire expansion. The first polynomial is \\((a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\).

So, yes, only the term where \\(c^k\\) is \\(c^0\\) would contribute to \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, my initial conclusion is correct. So, the coefficient is indeed 120. Wait, but let me check the problem again. It says: What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, in the entire expansion, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by any term from the second expansion, but to get just \\(a^2b^2\\), we need to have \\(c^0\\). So, the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the answer is 120. But wait, I just thought of another way to approach this. Maybe using generating functions or considering the product more carefully. Let me try expanding both parts separately and then see how the terms combine. First, \\((a + b)^4\\) expands to \\(a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. Now, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) expands to \\(c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15/c^2 + 6/c^4 + 1/c^6\\). So, the constant term is 20. Now, when you multiply these two expansions, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion will multiply each term in the second expansion, resulting in \\(a^2b^2c^6 + 6a^2b^2c^4 + 15a^2b^2c^2 + 20a^2b^2 + 15a^2b^2/c^2 + 6a^2b^2/c^4 + a^2b^2/c^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 20. But wait, that's not correct because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by the entire second expansion, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is actually the sum of all the coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by 6. Wait, no, that's not right. Because when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum of the products of the coefficients of terms whose exponents add up to that term. But in this case, we're looking for \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\). So, the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is to take \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first polynomial and the constant term from the second polynomial. Therefore, the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120.

So, when you multiply these, you get \\(a^2b^2 \\times c^0\\), which is just \\(a^2b^2\\). But wait, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), so the product would have terms that are combinations of \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\). But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). Wait, no, that's not correct. Wait, no, I think I made a mistake earlier. Let me clarify. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, in the product, each term is of the form \\(a^{k}b^{4 - k} \\times c^{m} \\times (1/c)^{6 - m}\\), which simplifies to \\(a^{k}b^{4 - k}c^{m - (6 - m)} = a^{k}b^{4 - k}c^{2m - 6}\\). But the problem is only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, that means we need to consider all terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) appears, regardless of the \\(c\\) exponent. Wait, no, that's not correct either. Wait, no, actually, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term in the first polynomial, and when you multiply by the second polynomial, you get terms that include \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial multiplied by the entire second polynomial. Wait, but that's not quite right. Because when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum of the products of coefficients of terms whose exponents add up to that term. But in this case, since the first polynomial is in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the second is in \\(c\\), the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are independent of the exponents of \\(c\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would come from multiplying the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial by every term in the second polynomial. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), that would mean we need to sum the products of the coefficients of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial with each term in the second polynomial. Wait, but that can't be right because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would include all possible powers of \\(c\\). But that's not the case. Wait, no, actually, the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\). So, to get \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms, we need to multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first polynomial by the constant term (the term with \\(c^0\\)) from the second polynomial. Because if we multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by any other term from the second polynomial, we'd get a term like \\(a^2b^2c\\) or \\(a^2b^2/c\\), which are different from \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is to multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first polynomial by the constant term from the second polynomial. Therefore, the coefficient is indeed 6 * 20 = 120. So, my initial reasoning was correct. Therefore, the coefficient is 120.

But is that the only term that contributes to \\(a^2b^2\\)? Let me think again. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). When I expand both, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second. So, to get a term with \\(a^2b^2\\), I need to pick the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first expansion and any term from the second expansion. But since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term without \\(c\\), we have to pick the term in the second expansion that has \\(c^0\\), because any other term would introduce a \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), making the entire term have \\(c\\) in it, which we don't want.

So, the coefficient is indeed 6 * 20 = 120. Hmm, but wait, is that correct? Because in the problem, we're dealing with the product of two polynomials, each with their own variables. So, when we multiply them, the variables from each are combined. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial is multiplied by the term \\(c^0\\) in the second polynomial, resulting in \\(a^2b^2c^0 = a^2b^2\\), which is exactly what we're looking for.

Because when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first polynomial will be multiplied by each term in the second polynomial, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for various \\(k\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2 and 2, respectively, but the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0. Because if there's any \\(c\\) term, then it's not just \\(a^2b^2\\), it's \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some \\(k\\). Therefore, the only term that contributes to \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is when we take \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first polynomial and multiply it by the constant term (c^0) from the second polynomial.

Suppose I didn't consider the second polynomial correctly. Maybe I should consider that the entire product is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), and we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\).

Therefore, the coefficient is indeed 6 * 20 = 120. So, I think I'm confident that 120 is the correct answer.\n\nWait, no, I think I made a mistake in my initial approach. Let me try to clarify. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\).

But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2 and 2, respectively, and the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0. Therefore, the only term that contributes to \\(a^2b^2\\) is when we multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by the constant term (c^0) from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120. So, I think I was correct earlier. But let me check once more.\n\nAlternatively, suppose I expand both expressions separately and then look for the coefficient. So, \\((a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. Then, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). The constant term is when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), so \\(m = 3\\), which gives \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first polynomial is multiplied by the constant term 20 from the second polynomial, giving \\(6 * 20 = 120\\) as the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the answer is 120.\n\nWait, but another way to think about it is that when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each polynomial. So, in this case, since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient is just the product of the coefficients of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, that's 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, I think I can confidently say that the coefficient is 120.\n\nWait, but let me just make sure I didn't confuse the terms. Suppose I didn't consider the second polynomial correctly. For example, if I thought that the entire expansion would have \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by all the terms in the second polynomial, but that's not the case because each term in the product is a combination of a term from each polynomial. So, only the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first polynomial multiplied by the constant term from the second polynomial would give the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the product. All other terms would have \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\) factors, so they wouldn't contribute to the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. Therefore, the coefficient is indeed 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nI think I've considered this from multiple angles and each time, the conclusion is the same. So, I'm pretty sure the coefficient is 120.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break down the problem into two parts:\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term containing \\(a^2b^2\\) occurs when \\(k = 2\\):\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\n   \\]\n   So, the coefficient is 6.\n\n2. **Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n   \\]\n   We need the constant term (where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0):\n   \\[\n   6 - 2m = 0 \\implies m = 3\n   \\]\n   The coefficient is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\n   \\]\n\n3. **Multiply the coefficients:**\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficients from each part:\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 20 = 120\n   \\]\n\n**Final Answer:**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}."

    "text": " But wait, hold on a second. Let me think again. The problem is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, when I expand this, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second. But the question is only about the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). Wait, no, actually, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would only come from the product of the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first part and the \\(c^0\\) term in the second part. Because if you take any other term from the second part, it would have a \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), which would make the entire term have a \\(c\\) factor, but since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, wait, no. Wait, actually, the problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", but in the entire expression, \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by different powers of \\(c\\). So, does the problem want the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some \\(k\\), or just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\)? Hmm, the way the problem is phrased: \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\". So, it's in the entire expression, which includes both \\(a, b, c\\). So, actually, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would have different coefficients depending on the power of \\(c\\). But I think the problem is asking for the coefficient of the term that has exactly \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). Wait, no, that can't be, because in the product, each term is a combination of \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by some power of \\(c\\), so the coefficient would vary depending on that. Wait, but the problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", which might imply that it's considering all terms where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2, regardless of the exponent of \\(c\\). But that doesn't make sense because the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would have different coefficients for different exponents of \\(c\\). Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where \\(a\\) is squared, \\(b\\) is squared, and \\(c\\) is to the zero power. That would make sense, because otherwise, the coefficient would depend on the power of \\(c\\). So, perhaps I need to consider the term where \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). In that case, my initial approach was correct: find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part, which is 20, then multiply them together to get 120. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is 120. But the problem just says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", so maybe it's considering \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) term, but in that case, the coefficient would actually be a sum over all possible \\(c\\) exponents. Wait, no, that doesn't make sense because in the product, each term is a unique combination of \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\). So, each term in the expansion is of the form \\(a^kb^{4 - k}c^m\\), where \\(k\\) ranges from 0 to 4, and \\(m\\) ranges based on the second expansion. But the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would only occur once, multiplied by a specific power of \\(c\\). Wait, no, actually, no. Because in the product, when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, which includes various powers of \\(c\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually be multiplied by different powers of \\(c\\), resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for different \\(k\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would actually be a sum over all the coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by the coefficient from the first. Wait, but that's not correct because each term in the product is a unique combination. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^k\\) in the second expansion. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which might be interpreted as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where \\(c\\) is to the zero power. Alternatively, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), then it's actually the sum of all coefficients where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present, but that would be an infinite sum because \\(c\\) can have any integer exponent. That doesn't make sense, so I think the problem must be asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where \\(a\\) is squared, \\(b\\) is squared, and \\(c\\) is to the zero power. Therefore, my initial approach was correct: 6 times 20 equals 120. So, the coefficient is 120. I think I was overcomplicating it, but I just wanted to make sure I understood the problem correctly. So, the final answer is 120.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break down the problem into two parts using the binomial theorem.\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\):**\n   Using the binomial theorem, the expansion is:\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\):\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} a^{2}b^{2} = 6a^2b^2\n   \\]\n   So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\n2. **Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   Using the binomial theorem, the expansion is:\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n   \\]\n   We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0:\n   \\[\n   6 - 2m = 0 \\implies m = 3\n   \\]\n   The coefficient is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\n   \\]\n\n3. **Combine the coefficients:**\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficients from each part:\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 20 = 120\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."
