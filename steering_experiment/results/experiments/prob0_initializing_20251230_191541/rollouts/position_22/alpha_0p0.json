    "text": " However, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is just one term, and when multiplied by the entire second part, it will result in \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so perhaps we're considering the coefficient in the entire product, but only the part that's multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, that might not be the case. Let me think again. When we multiply two expressions, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each expression. But in this case, \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term in \\((a + b)^4\\), and when multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), it will result in a term \\(a^2b^2 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would imply that we're looking at the entire product and identifying the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. Wait, but that might not be correct because in the product, \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, each term in the product will have both \\(a^2b^2\\) and some power of \\(c\\). Therefore, if we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), we need to consider all the terms that result in \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by any power of \\(c\\). But since the problem doesn't specify any condition on \\(c\\), I think it's just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, treating \\(c\\) as another variable. But that might not make sense because \\(c\\) is separate from \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, in that case, the coefficient would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't seem right because the coefficient would then be a polynomial in \\(c\\). Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try to approach it differently. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When we multiply these two expressions, each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product will be the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire second expansion. Wait, but that would mean the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not considering \\(c\\). So, perhaps the problem is only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable, so the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems odd because the problem is likely expecting a numerical coefficient, not a polynomial. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when considering all possible terms, including those multiplied by powers of \\(c\\). But that still wouldn't make sense because the coefficient would then be a function of \\(c\\). Wait, perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, in other words, we're looking for all terms in the product that have \\(a^2b^2\\), and the coefficient would be the sum of all the coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by 6. But that's not quite right either. Let me think again. When you multiply two expressions, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each expression. But in this case, \\(a^2b^2\\) is only present in the first expression, and it's multiplied by every term in the second expression. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expression multiplied by the entire second expression. But that would result in the coefficient being a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense if we're just looking for a numerical coefficient. Wait, maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, so the coefficient would indeed be a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem didn't specify, so I'm a bit confused. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems unlikely because the problem is probably expecting a numerical answer. Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try to think of it differently. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are different variables, the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from those involving \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient would be 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would still be a polynomial in \\(c\\), not a numerical coefficient. So, maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, which would mean that the coefficient is indeed 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems odd because the problem is likely expecting a numerical value. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when considering the entire product, and it's possible that the \\(c\\) terms are not relevant to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, no, because when you multiply, every term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by every term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), etc. So, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), it's actually asking for the sum of all the coefficients of the terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any power of \\(c\\). But that would mean the coefficient is 6 times the sum of the coefficients of all terms in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that's not correct because each term in the second expansion has a different power of \\(c\\), so the coefficient for each term in the product would be 6 times the corresponding coefficient in the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But again, that seems like a polynomial in \\(c\\), not a numerical coefficient. I'm getting a bit stuck here. Maybe I should try another approach. Let me consider that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, in other words, we're looking for all terms in the product that have \\(a^2b^2\\), and the coefficient would be the sum of all the coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by 6. But that would mean the coefficient is 6 times the sum of the coefficients of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, the sum of the coefficients of a polynomial is found by setting all variables to 1. So, if I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of the coefficients is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times 64, which is 384. But wait, that seems too straightforward. Let me check that again. If I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = 64\\), and the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, so the total coefficient would be 6 * 64 = 384. But is that correct? Let me think. When you set \\(c = 1\\), you're effectively summing all the coefficients in the second expansion, which gives you the total number of ways to choose terms from the second polynomial. Then, multiplying by the coefficient from the first polynomial gives the total coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. So, yes, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe I can think of it as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part. So, 6 * 64 = 384. Therefore, the coefficient is 384. Wait, but let me make sure. Let me consider a simpler case. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, expanding, \\((a + b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2\\), and \\((c + 1/c)^1 = c + 1/c\\). So, the product is \\(a^2(c + 1/c) + 2ab(c + 1/c) + b^2(c + 1/c)\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) is \\(c + 1/c\\), which is the same as 1 times (c + 1/c). Similarly, the coefficient of \\(ab\\) is 2(c + 1/c), and the coefficient of \\(b^2\\) is (c + 1/c). So, in this case, the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) is indeed the coefficient from the first part (which is 1) multiplied by the entire second expansion. Similarly, in the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the entire second expansion. But if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, then perhaps we need to consider that the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), but if we're only interested in the numerical coefficient when \\(c\\) is not present, that's not the case here. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable, so the coefficient would be 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems like a high-degree polynomial, and the problem is likely expecting a numerical coefficient. So, perhaps the correct approach is to realize that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but if we're only interested in the coefficient as a number, then we need to evaluate \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) at \\(c = 1\\), which gives 64, and then multiply by 6 to get 384. So, the coefficient is 384. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it, and the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and the \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) part doesn't affect that coefficient because \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\). But that doesn't seem right because when you multiply, each term from the first polynomial is multiplied by each term from the second, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But again, that's a polynomial in \\(c\\), not a number. So, perhaps the problem is expecting me to recognize that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but if we're to present it as a coefficient, it would be 6 times that expansion. But that seems unlikely because the problem is probably expecting a numerical answer. Wait, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, meaning that we're treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable and just looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would be 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that's a polynomial, not a number. Alternatively, maybe the problem is only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when considering all possible terms, including those with \\(c\\), but that's not the case because the coefficient would then be a function of \\(c\\). I'm getting a bit stuck here, so let me try to approach it differently. Let me consider that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which would be the product of the coefficients of \\(a^2b^2\\) in each part. But since \\(a^2b^2\\) is only in the first part, and the second part is a separate polynomial, the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But again, that's a polynomial, not a number. So, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, so the coefficient is indeed 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But I'm not sure if that's what the problem is asking. Alternatively, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and the \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) part is irrelevant because \\(c\\) is a different variable. But that seems incorrect because when you multiply, each term from the first polynomial is multiplied by each term from the second, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that's a polynomial in \\(c\\), so unless the problem is asking for the coefficient as a function of \\(c\\), it's not a numerical value. Wait, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, and it's possible that the \\(c\\) terms are supposed to be considered as separate, so the coefficient is just 6, and the rest is part of the other terms. But that doesn't make sense because when you multiply, the coefficients multiply. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But again, that's a polynomial. I'm getting a bit confused here. Let me try to think of it differently. Suppose I have two polynomials, P(a, b) and Q(c). When I multiply them, the result is a polynomial in a, b, and c. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be present in the product as \\(a^2b^2 \\times Q(c)\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is \\(6 \\times Q(c)\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But if the problem is asking for the coefficient as a number, it's not possible unless \\(c\\) is given a specific value. So, perhaps the problem is only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and the second part is irrelevant because \\(c\\) is a different variable. But that seems incorrect because when you multiply, the coefficients do multiply. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But since the problem didn't specify, I think the correct approach is to recognize that the coefficient is 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). However, if the problem is expecting a numerical answer, perhaps it's considering that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 64, giving 384. So, the coefficient is 384. Let me verify that. The sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 * 64 = 384. So, the final answer is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is multiplied by this coefficient. To find the numerical coefficient, we sum the coefficients of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives 64. Multiplying 6 by 64 yields 384.\n\n$\\boxed{384}$"

    "text": " But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), that means we need to consider how the multiplication affects the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. Wait, but actually, when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second. However, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion is a scalar (6) multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), and when you multiply it by the second expansion, it becomes \\(6 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 \\times a^2b^2\\). But since we're only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), that implies that the only way \\(a^2b^2\\) can appear in the product is if it's multiplied by a term in the second expansion that is \\(c^0\\), because any other power of \\(c\\) would introduce \\(c\\) into the term, making it not just \\(a^2b^2\\). So, in other words, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is equal to the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) multiplied by the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which we already found to be 6. So, now I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me think about how to do that. Again, using the binomial theorem, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying the exponents, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m} = \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, we're looking for the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, meaning \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Let me calculate that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Therefore, going back to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the second part), which is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Wait, does that make sense? Let me double-check. So, \\((a + b)^4\\) gives us a term \\(6a^2b^2\\), and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) gives us a term \\(20c^0 = 20\\). So when we multiply these two, we get \\(6 \\times 20 a^2b^2 = 120a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient is 120. Hmm, that seems correct. Let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes in my calculations. So, \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) is indeed 6, and \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\) is 20. Multiplying them gives 120. Yeah, that seems right.

But that sum is when \\(c = 1\\), which is \\( (1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, 6 * 64 = 384. But I'm not sure if that's correct. Alternatively, maybe I'm supposed to consider that the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is only multiplied by the constant term in the second expansion, which is the term where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out. Because otherwise, the term would have \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\) in it, which would make it not a constant term. So, perhaps the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). That makes more sense because then the term would be \\(a^2b^2\\) times the constant term, which is the coefficient we're looking for.

But since \\(a^2b^2\\) is only from the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), and the second part is in \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would just be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because when you multiply, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second. But wait, that seems too broad.

But that doesn't seem right because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not \\(a^2b^2\\) times anything else. Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When you expand this, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because each term in the second part is a coefficient times a power of \\(c\\), and when you multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), the \\(c\\) terms just become part of the product, but since we're only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, we just need the sum of all coefficients in the second part. So, the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\). Let me check that. If I substitute \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = (2)^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of all coefficients in the second part is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 64 (sum of coefficients in the second part), which is 6 * 64 = 384. Wait, but that seems too straightforward. Let me make sure I'm not missing something. Alternatively, perhaps I should think of it as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6, and when you multiply by any term in the second part, the coefficient just gets multiplied by that term's coefficient. So, the total coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which is 6 * 64 = 384. Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe I should think of it as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. Yeah, that makes sense. So, I think the coefficient is 384. Wait, but let me double-check. Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the second part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), when expanded, has terms like \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - k}(1/c)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, the sum of all coefficients would be when \\(c = 1\\), which is indeed 2^6 = 64. So, yes, the sum of coefficients is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 * 64 = 384. So, I think that's the answer.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Suppose I don't substitute \\(c = 1\\), but instead, I consider that when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\).

But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, the total coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64.

But wait, that can't be right because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\). So, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, perhaps the problem is considering \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) as separate variables, and it's asking for the coefficient of the term where \\(a\\) is squared, \\(b\\) is squared, and \\(c\\) is raised to some power, but since \\(c\\) is involved, maybe it's a bit more complicated. Wait, but \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), so perhaps the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that doesn't make sense because the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by each term in the \\(c\\) expansion. Wait, no, that's not correct. Let me think again. When you have two polynomials multiplied together, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each polynomial. But in this case, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is only from the first polynomial, \\((a + b)^4\\), and in the second polynomial, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), there are terms involving \\(c^k\\) and \\(c^{-k}\\). So, when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second polynomial, you get terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) and \\(a^2b^2c^{-k}\\), but the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would only be the case if the second polynomial contributes a constant term, i.e., \\(c^0 = 1\\). So, perhaps the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because if you have \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by 1 (the constant term), that would give you \\(a^2b^2\\), and all other terms would have extra powers of \\(c\\), which aren't part of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, that makes sense. Therefore, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), and then multiply that by 6 to get the final coefficient. So, let me calculate that. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) can be done using the binomial theorem as well. So, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, which is \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(6 = 2k\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the second part), which is 6 * 20 = 120. Wait, but let me double-check that. So, in the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6. In the second part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. So, when you multiply the two polynomials together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial, but only the constant term (c^0) will result in a term that is just \\(a^2b^2\\). All other terms would have \\(c\\) raised to some power, so they wouldn't contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the total coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120. So, I think that's the answer.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break down the problem into two parts:\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\), so its coefficient is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\n   \\]\n\n2. **Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) and find the constant term (coefficient of \\(c^0\\)):**\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n   \\]\n   We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0:\n   \\[\n   6 - 2k = 0 \\implies k = 3\n   \\]\n   The coefficient is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\n   \\]\n\n3. **Multiply the coefficients from both expansions:**\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 20 = 120\n   \\]\n\n**Final Answer:** The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

But that doesn't make much sense because usually, when someone asks for the coefficient of a term, they're looking for a numerical coefficient, not a polynomial. Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again. Perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some \\(k\\), but the problem statement doesn't specify \\(c\\). Alternatively, maybe the problem is only considering the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) parts and treating the \\(c\\) part as a constant factor, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that also seems a bit unclear. Wait, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, treating \\(c\\) as another variable. So, in that case, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by any term from the \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) expansion. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, would the coefficient be 6 * 64 = 384? But that seems high. Alternatively, perhaps I'm supposed to consider that the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is only present in the product, and the \\(c\\) terms are separate, so the coefficient would just be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which would make the coefficient a polynomial. But that doesn't seem right because the problem is asking for a coefficient, which is usually a number. Wait, maybe I'm misinterpreting the problem. Let me check again: it says, \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, perhaps the problem is considering all variables together, and we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning that the exponents of \\(c\\) must cancel out. That is, when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), you get terms like \\(a^kb^{4 - k}c^m\\), and we're looking for the term where \\(k = 2\\), \\(4 - k = 2\\), and \\(m = 0\\). So, the coefficient would be the product of the binomial coefficients from each part where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out. Wait, that makes more sense. So, in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - m}(1/c)^m = \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, to have the exponent of \\(c\\) be zero, we set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which gives \\(m = 3\\). So, the term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) that has \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 20 = 120. So, the coefficient is 120. Let me verify that again. So, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). In \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero is when \\(m = 3\\), so \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).

So, that means I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), then multiply it by 6, which is the coefficient from the first part. So, first, let me find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Again, I can use the binomial theorem for this. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\).

Now, I need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero because that's the constant term. So, set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\).

So when I multiply these two parts together, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term is multiplied by 20, giving 6 * 20 = 120. That seems right. Let me check if I considered all the steps correctly. Did I miss anything? Hmm, I don't think so. The key was realizing that to get a term without \\(c\\), I needed the constant term from the second binomial, which is 20, and then multiply it by the coefficient from the first binomial, which is 6.

Therefore, the sum of all coefficients is when we set \\(c = 1\\), which gives us \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} = 2^6 = 64\\), as I thought earlier. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 * 64 = 384. Wait, but let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that each term in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is of the form \\(\\dbinom{4}{m}a^{4 - m}b^m \\times \\dbinom{6}{n}c^{6 - n}(1/c)^n\\), which simplifies to \\(\\dbinom{4}{m}\\dbinom{6}{n} a^{4 - m}b^m c^{6 - 2n}\\). Now, we're looking for the term where \\(a^2b^2\\), so \\(4 - m = 2\\) and \\(m = 2\\). So, for the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) parts, m must be 2. Now, the \\(c\\) part can be any exponent, but since the problem doesn't specify any condition on \\(c\\), we need to consider all possible exponents of \\(c\\) and sum their coefficients. So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the sum over all n from 0 to 6 of \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\dbinom{6}{n}\\), because m is fixed at 2, and n varies. Therefore, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} \\times \\sum_{n=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{n}\\). We know that \\(\\sum_{n=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{n} = 2^6 = 64\\), so the coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384. So, that seems consistent with my earlier reasoning. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 384. Wait, but let me check if I'm interpreting the problem correctly. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, that would mean that in the expansion, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by every possible term from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each contributing a different power of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, perhaps I can think of it as the product of the two expressions: the first part contributes \\(a^2b^2\\) with coefficient 6, and the second part contributes any term, so the total coefficient is 6 times the sum of the coefficients of the second part, which is 64. So, 6 * 64 = 384. Therefore, I think the answer is 384. But just to be thorough, let me check with an alternative approach. Let's compute \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) separately and then see how the coefficients multiply. First, \\((a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, as I found before. Now, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) can be expanded as \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - k}(1/c)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, the coefficients are \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}\\) for each term \\(c^{6 - 2k}\\). Now, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in the first will multiply each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first polynomial will multiply each term in the second polynomial, resulting in \\(6a^2b^2 \\times \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second polynomial. The sum of the coefficients in the second polynomial is when \\(c = 1\\), which is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} = 64\\). So, 6 * 64 = 384. Therefore, the coefficient is 384. I think that's correct. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning. So, the final answer should be 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplying it by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), resulting in \\(2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n\\boxed{384}"

Because any term involving \\(c\\) would introduce \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\) into the term, which would make it something like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2/c^k\\), but since we're only interested in \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term without \\(c\\), that would mean that the coefficient is the product of the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) and the constant term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, first, I found that the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. Now, I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). To find the constant term, I can use the binomial theorem again. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\).

The constant term occurs when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, so we set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20.

Expanding \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem: \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\): \\(6 = 2k\\) => \\(k = 3\\). So, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire product is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). So, the answer should be 120. Wait, let me double-check. So, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. In \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Multiplying them together gives 120. So, yes, that seems correct. Alternatively, if the problem was just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without considering \\(c\\), then the answer would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but that would be a polynomial, not a single number. So, I think the intended interpretation is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break down the problem as follows:\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\), so the coefficient is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\n   \\]\n\n2. **Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n   \\]\n   We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, which occurs when \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), so \\(k = 3\\). The coefficient is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\n   \\]\n\n3. **Multiply the coefficients:**\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product is:\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 20 = 120\n   \\]\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}."

So, that means we can treat the second part as a constant when looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, is that correct? Let me think again. If I have \\((a + b)^4\\) times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), then each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term from \\((a + b)^4\\), and we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, perhaps we can consider the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) as a single constant when looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Alternatively, maybe the problem is structured such that the \\(c\\) terms don't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, that might not be right because when you multiply two expressions, each term from the first is multiplied by each term from the second. But since we're only interested in \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term from the first expression, and we're looking for the coefficient of that term in the product, regardless of the \\(c\\) part. So, perhaps the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by every term in the other expansion. But that would mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, that doesn't seem right because the problem is probably expecting a numerical coefficient, not an expression involving \\(c\\). Maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try a different approach. Since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and that term comes from \\((a + b)^4\\), and the other part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a separate expansion. So, perhaps the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is just the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all the terms in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems odd because the sum of all terms in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) would be a value, and then multiplied by 6. But I think I'm misunderstanding the problem. Wait, maybe the question is just to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, perhaps the \\(c\\) terms are just part of the expression, and when you multiply, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will be multiplied by every term in the \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) expansion. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because each term in the product will have \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by a term from the other expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Now, how do I find the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)? The sum of the coefficients is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), because that makes each term equal to its coefficient. So, substituting \\(c = 1\\) into \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) gives \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 64. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 * 64 = 384. Wait, but that seems high. Let me check again. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\), and the rest is just multiplied as a constant factor, so the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that would mean the coefficient is 6 times 64, which is 384. Alternatively, maybe I'm supposed to treat the entire expression as a single expansion and find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. But that's not possible because \\(c\\) and \\(a, b\\) are separate variables. So, perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the other expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, maybe the problem is expecting the coefficient to be 6, because the \\(c\\) terms are separate and don't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. But that doesn't make sense because when you multiply, each term from \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term from the other expansion, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would indeed be 6 times the sum of the coefficients from the other expansion. So, 6 * 64 = 384. Hmm, I'm a bit confused, but I think that's the right approach. Let me try to see if that makes sense. Let's consider a simpler case: suppose we have \\((a + b)^1 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, the coefficient of \\(a^1b^0\\) would be 1 times the sum of coefficients in the second expansion, which is 1 + 1 = 2. So, the coefficient of \\(a\\) would be 2. Similarly, the coefficient of \\(b\\) would be 1 times 2 = 2. So, in that case, the approach works. Therefore, in our original problem, the coefficient should be 6 * 64 = 384. Wait, but let me think again. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient is 6, and then when you multiply by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in that expansion is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would indeed be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to be interpreted differently, such as finding the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some \\(k\\), but the problem only specifies \\(a^2b^2\\), so I think the correct approach is to consider the entire expansion of the second part as a multiplier to the first part's coefficient. Therefore, the coefficient is 384. Wait, but I just want to make sure I didn't make a mistake in calculating the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). When \\(c = 1\\), it's \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\), which is correct. So, yes, the sum is 64. Therefore, the coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, maybe I should consider that the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which would mean that the coefficient is just 6, because the other part is multiplied as a whole. But that doesn't seem right because when you multiply two expressions, each term in one is multiplied by each term in the other. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in the other expression. So, I think 384 is the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplying it by the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Setting \\(c = 1\\) in the second expression gives the sum of coefficients as 64. Therefore, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\boxed{384}."

So, when you multiply, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), that would mean that the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by the term \\(1\\) from the second part, which is the constant term.

Therefore, I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero.

So, actually, the only way \\(a^2b^2\\) can appear without any \\(c\\) terms is if it's multiplied by the constant term in the second expansion. So, yes, that's correct. Therefore, I think 120 is the right answer.\n\nWait, let me make sure. Let me compute \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) again. The general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\times \\dfrac{1}{c^m} = \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the exponents are 6, 4, 2, 0, -2, -4, -6. So, the constant term is when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which is at \\(m = 3\\), as I found earlier. So, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, the coefficient is 6 times 20, which is 120. So, yeah, I think that's correct.\n\nWait another thought: sometimes, when dealing with products, the coefficient of a term in the product is the sum of the products of coefficients of terms that multiply to give that term. But in this case, since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) is to multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion by the constant term from the second expansion. So, that's just 6 times 20, which is 120. So, I think that's the answer.\n\nWait, let me just think if there's any other way this could happen. Suppose I have other terms, but since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), any term from the second expansion that isn't constant would introduce \\(c\\) to some power, making the term have \\(c\\) in it, which wouldn't be \\(a^2b^2\\). So, only the constant term from the second expansion contributes. So, yes, 120 is the coefficient.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me think about the entire expansion. The first part is \\((a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). The second part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which, as we saw, has a constant term of 20. So, when you multiply these together, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by 20, giving \\(120a^2b^2\\). All other terms from the second expansion would introduce \\(c\\) terms, so they don't contribute to \\(a^2b^2\\). So, yes, the coefficient is 120.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because sometimes when you have products, you have to consider all possible combinations, but in this case, since we're looking for a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), the only way is to multiply by the constant term. So, I think 120 is correct.\n\nWait, another angle: suppose I consider the entire expression as a product of two polynomials. The first is in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), the second in \\(c\\). So, when you multiply them, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. But since we're interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), the only term that contributes is the constant term in the second polynomial, because any other term would have a \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\) factor, making the product term have \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), which isn't \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient is indeed 6 times 20, which is 120.\n\nWait, but let me just make sure I didn't make any calculation mistakes. So, \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\), correct. \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\), correct. 6 times 20 is 120, correct. So, I think I'm confident that the coefficient is 120.\n\nI think that's it. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem for both parts of the expression.\n\nFirst, consider the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n\\]\nThe term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\), so the coefficient is:\n\\[\n\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\n\\]\n\nNext, consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem:\n\\[\n\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n\\]\nWe need the constant term, which occurs when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero:\n\\[\n6 - 2m = 0 \\implies m = 3\n\\]\nThe constant term is:\n\\[\n\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\n\\]\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficients from each part:\n\\[\n6 \\times 20 = 120\n\\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

Because if I take \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part and multiply it by, say, \\(c^k\\) from the second part, that would give me a term \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), which isn't just \\(a^2b^2\\).

So, I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me think about that.

Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(6 = 2m\\) so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\).

Wait, but that can't be right because the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) isn't a number; it's actually another expression. Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again. The problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product of \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when you multiply two polynomials, each term from the first is multiplied by each term from the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), and it's multiplied by every term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second polynomial, the coefficients add up. So, first, I found that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. Now, I need to find the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). To find the sum of the coefficients in a polynomial, you can substitute \\(c = 1\\). So, let me compute \\(\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = (2)^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 * 64 = 384. Wait, but that seems a bit high. Let me check my reasoning again. Alternatively, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning that we need to find the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2, and the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0. Because in the product, each term is a combination of terms from both expansions. So, maybe I need to consider only the terms in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) that have \\(c^0\\), because when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), that would give a term with \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). So, perhaps my initial approach was incorrect. Let me try this again. So, the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But actually, since the expression is a product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by all possible terms from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would indeed be 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 64, giving 384. But maybe I'm missing something. Let me think differently. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). That is, any term in the product where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2, regardless of the exponent of \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), meaning that the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\), not a constant. But the problem asks for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which suggests that it's a numerical coefficient, not involving \\(c\\). So, perhaps the problem is intended to have the coefficient as a number, so maybe I was correct the first time, that it's 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating, and the answer is indeed 384. Let me check with a smaller exponent to see if my reasoning holds. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^2 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^1\\). Then, expanding, \\((a + b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2\\). The other part is \\(c + 1/c\\). So, the product would be \\((a^2 + 2ab + b^2)(c + 1/c)\\). The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in this product would be zero because there's no \\(a^2b^2\\) term. Wait, that's a problem. Alternatively, if I follow my earlier reasoning, the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) in \\((a + b)^2\\) is 1, and the sum of coefficients in \\((c + 1/c)^1\\) is \\(1 + 1 = 2\\), so 1 * 2 = 2, but in reality, the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) would be \\(c + 1/c\\), which isn't a constant. So, perhaps my initial approach was wrong. Therefore, maybe the correct way is to consider that the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from \\((a + b)^4\\) and is multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 multiplied by the entire \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), meaning that the coefficient is a polynomial, not a number. But the problem asks for the coefficient, which is a number, so perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), that is, the term where \\(a\\) is squared, \\(b\\) is squared, and \\(c\\) is to the zero power. In that case, I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product. So, let me approach it that way. So, first, from \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, as before. Now, from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\), because when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), it would give \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is the middle term, which occurs when the number of \\(c\\) terms equals the number of \\(1/c\\) terms. So, in the expansion, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(1/c\\right)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We want the exponent of \\(c\\) to be 0, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product is 6 * 20 = 120. So, that would be the answer. Wait, but earlier I thought it was 384, but that was under the assumption that I needed to multiply by the sum of all coefficients, which gave a constant. But in reality, the problem might be asking for the coefficient where \\(c\\) is also to the zero power. So, I think 120 is the correct answer. Let me confirm this. So, in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\) and is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But if we're only interested in the term where \\(c\\) is to the zero power, then we need to take 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 20, giving 120. Alternatively, if the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion, which would be a polynomial, but the problem asks for a coefficient, which is a number, so I think it's more likely that they want the coefficient when considering all variables, meaning \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). Therefore, I think the correct answer is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6. Next, we find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20. Multiplying these together gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{120}"

For example, if I have \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by \\(c^k\\), would that affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product? But no, because when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficients multiply, but the variables add exponents. So, \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^k\\) would be \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), which isn't the same as \\(a^2b^2\\).

Simplifying each term, that becomes \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m} = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, each term has an exponent of \\(c\\) equal to \\(6 - 2m\\).

Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (the constant term from the second part), which is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). So, the coefficient should be 120.\n\nWait, but let me double-check that. Is there another way to think about this? Because sometimes when you multiply two expressions, you might have to consider cross terms, but in this case, since \\(a^2b^2\\) is only from the first part, and we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, so actually, the coefficient is just the product of the coefficients from each part where the terms multiply to give \\(a^2b^2\\). So, yeah, since in the first part, \\(a^2b^2\\) has coefficient 6, and in the second part, the constant term is 20, then when you multiply them, you get 6*20=120. So, that seems right.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of the entire expansion as the product of two separate expansions, and since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), the coefficients multiply when the terms are multiplied. So, yeah, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the product of the coefficients of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial and the constant term in the second polynomial. So, that's 6*20=120. I think that's correct.\n\nWait, but let me just make sure I didn't make any calculation errors. So, \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) is 6, correct. Then, in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the constant term is when the exponent is zero, which occurs at \\(m=3\\), so \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}=20\\), correct. So, 6*20=120. Yeah, that seems right. So, the coefficient is 120.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Suppose I expand both expressions fully and then look for the term \\(a^2b^2\\). The term \\(a^2b^2\\) would come from the product of the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first expansion and every term in the second expansion. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, then the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. Wait, no, that's not right because each term in the second expansion has a different power of \\(c\\), so when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, you get terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), where \\(k\\) is some exponent. But we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would require that the \\(c\\) terms cancel out, i.e., the term where \\(k=0\\). So, that's why we're looking for the constant term in the second expansion. So, yes, 6*20=120 is correct.\n\nWait, another way to think about it: the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). If we consider that the \\(c\\) terms are independent of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), it's equivalent to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of the coefficients of all terms in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Wait, no, that's not quite right because each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) has a different power of \\(c\\), so when you multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), you get terms with different powers of \\(c\\). But since we're only interested in the term \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't have any \\(c\\) factors, that term can only come from the product of \\(a^2b^2\\) and the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, that's why we only need to consider the constant term, which is 20. So, 6*20=120.\n\nWait, but let me check if I'm confusing anything here. Suppose I have two polynomials, P(a, b) and Q(c). Then, the product P(a, b) * Q(c) would have terms where each term of P is multiplied by each term of Q. So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), it's the sum over all terms in Q of (coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in P) multiplied by (the corresponding term in Q). But since \\(a^2b^2\\) is independent of c, the only term in Q that would contribute to \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the constant term in Q. Because if Q has a term with c^k, then when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), it becomes \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), which is a different term. So, only the constant term in Q, which is when k=0, would give \\(a^2b^2\\) when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). So, that's why we only need to consider the constant term in Q, which is 20, and then multiply by the coefficient from P, which is 6, giving 120. So, that makes sense.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of it as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is equal to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in P(a, b) multiplied by the sum of the coefficients of all terms in Q(c), but that's not correct because the terms in Q are not constants unless they are the constant term. So, no, that approach would be wrong. Instead, it's correct that only the constant term in Q contributes to the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the product.\n\nWait, another way to check: suppose I set c=1, then \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) becomes \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). Then, the entire expression becomes \\((a + b)^4 * 64\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 * 64 = 384. But wait, that's not the same as 120. So, that seems contradictory. But why? Because when I set c=1, I'm not considering the varying powers of c. So, perhaps this approach isn't valid. Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in my initial reasoning.\n\nWait, let me think again. If I set c=1, then the entire expression becomes \\((a + b)^4 * 64\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6*64=384. But that's different from 120. So, that suggests that my initial approach was wrong. So, where did I go wrong?\n\nWait, perhaps I misapplied the concept. Because when I set c=1, I'm effectively evaluating the entire expression at c=1, which doesn't necessarily give me the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the original expression. Instead, it gives me the coefficient when c=1, which is different. So, that approach isn't helpful. So, perhaps I should stick with my original reasoning.\n\nWait, but let me try another approach. Let's consider the entire product \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the product of the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and every term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the only way for the product to have \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms is if the term from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is a constant, i.e., \\(c^0\\). So, that's why we need the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 20, and then multiply by 6 to get 120. So, that seems correct.\n\nBut when I set c=1, I get a different result. So, why is that? Because when c=1, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = 64\\), so the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 * 64\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6*64=384. But that's different from 120. So, why the discrepancy?\n\nAh, I think I see the confusion. When I set c=1, I'm evaluating the entire expression at c=1, which means that every term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) becomes 64. So, in that case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6*64=384. But that's not the same as the coefficient in the original expression. So, in the original expression, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120, but when evaluated at c=1, it becomes 384. So, that shows that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the original expression is 120, which is different from when we set c=1.\n\nTherefore, my initial approach was correct: the coefficient is 120. The confusion came from evaluating the expression at c=1, which changes the coefficients because it's a specific evaluation, not the general coefficient.\n\nSo, to recap, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6*20=120.\n\nI think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in this reasoning now.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is found using the binomial coefficient \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). The constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying these gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that seems a bit confusing. Let me think again. When you have two separate expressions multiplied together, like \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the product is such that every term in the first is multiplied by every term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is \\(6a^2b^2\\), as we found earlier. Then, when we multiply this by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) will be multiplied by \\(6a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be \\(6\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that can't be right because the sum of coefficients in a polynomial is found by setting all variables to 1. So, if I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) would be 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). But wait, that seems too straightforward. Let me check if I'm making a mistake here. Because actually, when you multiply \\(6a^2b^2\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the result is \\(6a^2b^2 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which would have terms like \\(6a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(6a^2b^2c^4\\), and so on, down to \\(6a^2b^2c^{-6}\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, actually, each term in the product that has \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by some power of \\(c\\) would contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion. Wait, but that's not correct because each term in the product would have both \\(a^2b^2\\) and some power of \\(c\\), so when you consider the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), it's actually the sum of all coefficients from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) multiplied by 6. So, yes, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 times 64, which is 384. Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try another approach. Since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, and since the two expressions are multiplied together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But since the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is a polynomial in \\(c\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by each term in that expansion, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), etc. But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in the entire product, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Because when you expand, each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) will be multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), so the total coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) is the sum of all coefficients from the second expression multiplied by 6. So, as I thought earlier, the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384. Let me just verify this another way. Alternatively, perhaps I can consider that when you have two independent variables, the coefficient of a specific term in one variable is independent of the other. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) can be considered as a polynomial in \\(c\\), but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient would just be 6 multiplied by the entire expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, perhaps I should think of the entire product as a product of two polynomials, and the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial and the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial. Because when you multiply, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient from the first part times the sum of coefficients from the second part. So, yes, that would be 6 * 64 = 384. Therefore, I think the coefficient is 384. Wait, but let me check again. Maybe I'm making a mistake in assuming that the sum of coefficients is 64. Let me compute \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) and find the sum of its coefficients. The sum of coefficients is when \\(c = 1\\), so \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). That's correct. So, the sum is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 * 64 = 384. So, I think that's the answer.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Alternatively, maybe I can consider that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is \\(6a^2b^2\\). When multiplied by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which expands to terms like \\(c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15c^{-2} + 6c^{-4} + c^{-6}\\), the product becomes \\(6a^2b^2c^6 + 36a^2b^2c^4 + 90a^2b^2c^2 + 120a^2b^2 + 90a^2b^2c^{-2} + 36a^2b^2c^{-4} + 6a^2b^2c^{-6}\\). Now, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, looking at the product, the term \\(120a^2b^2\\) is the only term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, i.e., \\(c^0\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 120. Wait, that's different from my previous conclusion of 384. So, I must have made a mistake earlier. Let me figure out where I went wrong.\n\nI think the confusion arises from whether the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), or if it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, considering all possible powers of \\(c\\). But the problem says: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which implies that we are considering the entire product as a polynomial in variables \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\). Therefore, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) can be multiplied by any power of \\(c\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the sum of all coefficients from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) multiplied by the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\). But when I expanded \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), I saw that the term with \\(c^0\\) is 20. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 * 20 = 120. Because only the term where \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) will result in a term with \\(a^2b^2\\) and no \\(c\\) term. Wait, but no, that's not correct either because when you multiply \\(6a^2b^2\\) by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), you get terms like \\(6a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(6a^2b^2c^4\\), etc., but the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would be the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. So, only the term where \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) multiplied by \\(6a^2b^2\\) would contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient is 6 multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Let me compute that. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) can be found using the binomial theorem: \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(1/c\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, the exponent of \\(c\\) is \\(6 - 2k\\). We want the exponent to be 0, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). So, my initial approach was wrong because I thought the sum of coefficients is 64, but actually, only the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero contributes to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the correct coefficient is 120.\n\nWait, but now I'm confused because I have two different answers: 384 and 120. Let me clarify the problem statement again. It says: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, in the entire product, we have terms involving \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\). The term \\(a^2b^2\\) would appear multiplied by various powers of \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which in the context of polynomials usually refers to the coefficient of the term \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where the exponents of \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are 2, 2, and 0 respectively. So, in that case, we need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product. Therefore, the coefficient would be the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). As we found earlier, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product is 6 * 20 = 120. So, the correct answer is 120.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought that the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 64, which is when \\(c = 1\\). But that's the sum of all coefficients, regardless of the power of \\(c\\). However, in this problem, we're only interested in the coefficient where the power of \\(c\\) is zero. So, the correct approach is to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 20, and then multiply it by 6 to get 120. So, I think the correct answer is 120. Let me confirm this by expanding \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem. The expansion is:\n\n\\[\n\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n\\]\n\nSo, the exponents of \\(c\\) are:\n\n- For \\(k=0\\): \\(6 - 0 = 6\\)\n- For \\(k=1\\): \\(6 - 2 = 4\\)\n- For \\(k=2\\): \\(6 - 4 = 2\\)\n- For \\(k=3\\): \\(6 - 6 = 0\\)\n- For \\(k=4\\): \\(6 - 8 = -2\\)\n- For \\(k=5\\): \\(6 - 10 = -4\\)\n- For \\(k=6\\): \\(6 - 12 = -6\\)\n\nSo, the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero is when \\(k=3\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} c^0 = 20\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. So, when we multiply this by the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, we get 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 120.\n\nWait, but let me think again. The problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\". In the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in the expansion would be of the form \\(a^kb^{4 - k}c^m\\), where \\(k\\) ranges from 0 to 4, and \\(m\\) ranges over the exponents from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would correspond to \\(k=2\\), and we need the coefficient when \\(m=0\\). Therefore, the coefficient is indeed the product of the binomial coefficients from each expansion where the exponents match. So, 6 from \\((a + b)^4\\) and 20 from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), giving 120.\n\nWait, but another way to think about it is that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), because when you multiply, you're combining terms where the exponents add up. So, yes, that makes sense. Therefore, the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nI think I confused myself earlier by considering the sum of coefficients, but that's only relevant if you're looking for the total sum of all coefficients in the product, which isn't what the problem is asking. The problem is specifically asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which in the context of multiple variables typically means the coefficient of the term where only \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) have the specified exponents and the other variables (in this case, \\(c\\)) have an exponent of zero. So, the correct approach is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product, which is 120.\n\nLet me just make sure by considering a smaller example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, expanding this, we have \\((a^2 + 2ab + b^2)(c + 1/c)\\). The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be zero because there's no \\(a^2b^2\\) term. Wait, that's a bad example because the second polynomial is only to the first power. Let me try \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^2\\). Expanding, we get \\((a^2 + 2ab + b^2)(c^2 + 2c \\times 1/c + 1/c^2)\\) which simplifies to \\((a^2 + 2ab + b^2)(c^2 + 2 + 1/c^2)\\). Now, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would appear only if we multiply \\(a^2\\) by \\(b^2\\), but in the expansion, each term is a product of terms from each polynomial. So, the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) is if we multiply \\(a^2\\) by \\(b^2\\), but in the second polynomial, there's no \\(b^2\\) term. Wait, actually, in this case, the second polynomial is only in \\(c\\), so the product would have terms like \\(a^2c^2\\), \\(2a^2\\), \\(a^2/c^2\\), etc., but no \\(a^2b^2\\) term. So, in this case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be zero. But according to our method, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{2}{2} = 1\\), and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\((c + 1/c)^2\\) is 2. So, 1 * 2 = 2, but in reality, the coefficient is zero. Hmm, this suggests that my method might be incorrect. Wait, that's a problem. So, in this smaller example, the method gives 2, but the actual coefficient is zero. So, my approach must be wrong. Therefore, I need to rethink this.\n\nWait, perhaps the confusion is because in the smaller example, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't exist in the product because the second polynomial doesn't have any \\(b\\) terms. So, in the original problem, the second polynomial is only in \\(c\\), so when you multiply, the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms are only from the first polynomial, and the \\(c\\) terms are only from the second. Therefore, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product can only come from the first polynomial, and it's multiplied by the entire second polynomial. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is indeed the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial multiplied by the entire second polynomial. But in the smaller example, \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^2\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would only appear if both polynomials have terms involving \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\), which they don't. So, in that case, the coefficient is zero. But in the original problem, the second polynomial is only in \\(c\\), so when you multiply, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), etc. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which in the context of multiple variables, usually refers to the term where the exponents of \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are as specified. If the problem had said \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\)\", then it would be 120. But as it is, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would include all terms where \\(a\\) is squared and \\(b\\) is squared, regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would be the sum of all coefficients from the second polynomial multiplied by 6. Therefore, the coefficient would be 6 * 64 = 384. But in the smaller example, \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^2\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be zero because there's no \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the product. Wait, but according to this logic, the coefficient would be 1 * 64 (if the second polynomial were to the 6th power), but in the smaller example, it's 2, but the actual coefficient is zero. So, perhaps the problem is that when the second polynomial doesn't have any \\(a\\) or \\(b\\) terms, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is zero because you can't get \\(a^2b^2\\) without multiplying by something that has \\(a\\) or \\(b\\). Wait, but in the original problem, the second polynomial is only in \\(c\\), so when you multiply, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial, which are all in \\(c\\). So, the product would have terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), etc., but none where \\(c\\) is zero. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is 6 * 20 = 120, but the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\) would be 6 * 64 = 384. But in the smaller example, \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^2\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be zero because you can't get \\(a^2b^2\\) without multiplying \\(a^2\\) by \\(b^2\\), but the second polynomial doesn't have any \\(b\\) terms. Wait, but in the original problem, the second polynomial doesn't have any \\(a\\) or \\(b\\) terms either. So, how do we get \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product? We can't, because the second polynomial only contributes \\(c\\) terms. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is zero, because you can't get \\(a^2b^2\\) without multiplying by something that has \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), but the second polynomial doesn't have those. Wait, but in the original problem, the first polynomial is \\((a + b)^4\\), which does have \\(a^2b^2\\) as a term, and the second polynomial is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which doesn't have any \\(a\\) or \\(b\\) terms. So, when you multiply them, you get terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), etc., but no term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\). Wait, no, that's not true. The second polynomial does have a term with \\(c^0\\), which is 20. So, when you multiply \\(6a^2b^2\\) by \\(20c^0\\), you get \\(120a^2b^2\\). So, in the product, there is a term \\(120a^2b^2\\), which means the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120. So, in the smaller example, \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^2\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be zero because the second polynomial doesn't have any \\(a\\) or \\(b\\) terms, so you can't get \\(a^2b^2\\) without multiplying by something that has \\(a\\) or \\(b\\). But in the original problem, the second polynomial has a \\(c^0\\) term, which is a constant, so when you multiply \\(6a^2b^2\\) by 20, you get \\(120a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient is 120.\n\nWait, but in the smaller example, \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^2\\), the product would have terms like \\(a^2c^2\\), \\(2a^2\\), \\(a^2/c^2\\), \\(2ab c\\), \\(4ab\\), \\(2ab/c\\), \\(b^2c^2\\), \\(2b^2\\), \\(b^2/c^2\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would only appear if we multiply \\(a^2\\) by \\(b^2\\), but in the second polynomial, there's no \\(b^2\\) term. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is zero. So, in the original problem, the second polynomial has a term where \\(c^0\\), which is 20, so when we multiply \\(6a^2b^2\\) by 20, we get \\(120a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient is 120.\n\nTherefore, going back to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 120.\n\nWait, but let me check this again. Let me compute the product step by step. \\((a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) expands to \\(c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15/c^2 + 6/c^4 + 1/c^6\\). Now, when we multiply these two, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial will be multiplied by each term in the second polynomial, resulting in:\n\n- \\(6a^2b^2c^6\\)\n- \\(36a^2b^2c^4\\)\n- \\(90a^2b^2c^2\\)\n- \\(120a^2b^2\\)\n- \\(90a^2b^2/c^2\\)\n- \\(36a^2b^2/c^4\\)\n- \\(6a^2b^2/c^6\\)\n\nSo, the term \\(120a^2b^2\\) is the only term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 120. All other terms have \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by some power of \\(c\\), so they don't contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when considering the entire product as a polynomial in \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\). Therefore, the correct answer is 120.\n\nI think I confused myself earlier by considering the sum of coefficients, but that's only relevant if we're looking for the total sum of coefficients in the product, which isn't what the problem is asking. The problem specifically wants the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which, in the context of multiple variables, refers to the term where \\(a\\) is squared, \\(b\\) is squared, and \\(c\\) is to the zero power. Therefore, the coefficient is 120.\n\nTo summarize:\n\n1. Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is 6.\n2. Expand \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem and find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\), which is 20.\n3. Multiply these two coefficients together to get 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break down the problem into two parts using the binomial theorem.\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\):\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\n   \\]\n   So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\n2. **Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n   \\]\n   We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero:\n   \\[\n   6 - 2k = 0 \\implies k = 3\n   \\]\n   The coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\n   \\]\n\n3. **Combine the results:**\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the product of the coefficients from each expansion:\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 20 = 120\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

    "text": " So, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first part will be multiplied by every term in the second part. But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is independent of \\(c\\), does that mean we just take the coefficient from the first part and multiply it by the entire expansion of the second part? Wait, no, that can't be right because the second part is a separate variable. Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think again. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, when you expand this, each term will be a product of a term from the first expansion and a term from the second expansion. So, for example, a term from \\((a + b)^4\\) would be something like \\(a^2b^2\\) with coefficient 6, and a term from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) would be, say, \\(c^k \\times (1/c)^{6 - k}\\) which simplifies to \\(c^{2k - 6}\\). But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), we can consider that term as being multiplied by all possible terms from the second expansion. However, since \\(a^2b^2\\) is independent of \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) would accumulate all the coefficients from the second expansion. So, that means I need to find the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). The sum of coefficients in a polynomial is found by setting all variables to 1. So, if I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(1 + 1/1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of all coefficients in the second part is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 64 (sum of coefficients from the second part), which is 6 * 64 = 384. Wait, but let me check that again. Because actually, when you multiply two expressions, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each factor. But in this case, since we're looking for \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term in the first factor, and it's multiplied by every term in the second factor, which is a polynomial in \\(c\\). So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would indeed be the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Because each term in the second part, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), would contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. So, yeah, that makes sense. Therefore, 6 * 64 = 384. Wait, but let me make sure I'm not missing anything. Alternatively, maybe I should think of it as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times the entire expansion of the second part, so it's 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term without \\(c\\), that would mean that the coefficient is 6 multiplied by the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, giving 384. Yeah, that seems right. Alternatively, maybe I can approach it differently. Let me consider the entire product. The product is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). When expanded, each term would be of the form \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}a^{4 - k}b^k \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - m}(1/c)^m\\). Simplifying the exponent on \\(c\\), that's \\(c^{6 - m - m} = c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, each term is \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}\\dbinom{6}{m} a^{4 - k}b^k c^{6 - 2m}\\). Now, we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which implies that \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). So, when \\(k = 2\\), the coefficient from the first part is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Now, for each such term, we have to consider all possible \\(m\\) values from 0 to 6, because the second part can have any exponent on \\(c\\), but since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), the exponent on \\(c\\) can be anything, but the coefficient would be the sum over all \\(m\\) of \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\). So, the total coefficient would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} \\times \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m}\\). But the sum of \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\) from \\(m=0\\) to \\(6\\) is \\(2^6 = 64\\), as I calculated before. So, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). Hmm, that seems consistent. Alternatively, maybe I can think of it as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part, which is 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Since \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) expands to a sum of terms with various powers of \\(c\\), but when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients of all terms in the second expansion, which is 6 times 64, which is 384. So, I think that's correct. Let me just double-check my calculations. \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) is 6, that's correct. \\(2^6\\) is 64, correct. 6 times 64 is 384, yes. So, the coefficient is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplying it by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is \\(2^6 = 64\\). Thus, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n\\boxed{384}"

Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, perhaps the expression is being treated as a single expression, and we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, in other words, when you expand the entire product, what is the coefficient for the term \\(a^2b^2\\) times any power of \\(c\\).

Wait, but that seems like it's adding up all the coefficients, which would be the same as evaluating \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) at \\(c = 1\\), because that would sum all the coefficients. So, maybe the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 6 \\times 64 = 384\\). But wait, that seems too straightforward. Let me check. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is 6 from the first part, and when multiplied by the entire second part, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But the sum of the coefficients is indeed \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). So, 6 times 64 is 384. But wait, let me think again. Is that correct? Because when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficients multiply. So, if you have \\(P(a, b) \\times Q(c)\\), then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(P(a, b)\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(Q(c)\\).

So, yes, that would be 6 times \\(2^6 = 64\\), so 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, maybe I should compute the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) first. Let's do that. Using the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). Now, when we multiply this by \\((a + b)^4\\), which has a term \\(6a^2b^2\\), the product will have terms like \\(6a^2b^2 \\times \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\) for each \\(m\\) from 0 to 6. So, each of these terms will be \\(6 \\times \\dbinom{6}{m} a^2b^2 c^{6 - 2m}\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the sum over all \\(m\\) of \\(6 \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}\\). Because each term contributes \\(6 \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}\\) to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\).

Therefore, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). So, I think that's the answer. But let me double-check. Alternatively, maybe the problem expects me to consider that the entire expression is a product, and when expanding, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\), and it's multiplied by every term in the other expansion.

So, for \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), setting \\(c = 1\\) gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of all coefficients in the second part is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 64 (sum of coefficients in the second part), which is 6 * 64 = 384. Wait, but that seems high. Let me think again. Alternatively, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Perhaps the question is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, considering all possible terms, which would involve the product of the coefficients from each part. But wait, no, because \\(a^2b^2\\) is only from the first part, and the second part is separate. So, when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by the entire expansion of the second part, each term in the second part adds a coefficient to the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. So, the total coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is indeed 6 * 64 = 384. But wait, let me verify this with a different approach. Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the entire expression is the product of two polynomials, and the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be present in the first part, and when multiplied by any term in the second part, it will result in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), but the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\) would be the sum of all coefficients from the second part multiplied by the coefficient from the first part. So, that would be 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me think about it differently. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first part, and when multiplied by the entire second part, it's like distributing \\(a^2b^2\\) across all terms of the second expansion. So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is indeed the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Therefore, 6 * 64 = 384. So, I think that's the answer. But wait, let me make sure. Let's compute the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). As I said earlier, set \\(c = 1\\): \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, yes, the sum is 64. Therefore, 6 * 64 = 384. So, the coefficient is 384. Alternatively, maybe I should think about it as the product of the two expansions. The first expansion has \\(a^2b^2\\) with coefficient 6, and the second expansion has a sum of coefficients 64. So, when you multiply these together, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 * 64 = 384. Yeah, that makes sense. So, I think the answer is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplying it by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 64. Therefore, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n\\boxed{384}"

So, that means that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product will be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times each of those coefficients, but since we're only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, we just need 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. Wait, no, that doesn't sound right. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think again. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When we expand this, each term will be of the form \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k \\times \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying the \\(c\\) terms: \\(c^{6 - m} \\times c^{-m} = c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, each term is \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} \\dbinom{6}{m} a^{4 - k}b^k c^{6 - 2m}\\). Now, the problem asks for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, we need the terms where \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). So, that's the same as before, where \\(k = 2\\), so the coefficient from the first part is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Now, for the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, when we multiply by 6, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) will be \\(6 \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}\\) for each term, but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), the total coefficient would be the sum over all \\(m\\) of \\(6 \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}\\). Wait, but that would be 6 times the sum of all the binomial coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The sum of the binomial coefficients in any expansion \\((x + y)^n\\) is \\(2^n\\), so in this case, it would be \\(2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the total coefficient would be \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). But wait, that seems too high. Let me check my reasoning again. Alternatively, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. It asks for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in the product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Since each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\), the sum of the coefficients (i.e., when \\(c = 1\\)) is \\(2^6 = 64\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). Hmm, that seems correct, but let me think again. Alternatively, maybe I should consider that when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is only affected by the coefficients from the first part, and the second part contributes a factor that is the sum of all its coefficients. So, yes, that would be 64, and 6 times 64 is 384. Alternatively, maybe I should think of it as the coefficient being 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is indeed 64. So, 6 * 64 = 384. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 384.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. Another approach: The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). To find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), we can treat the two parts separately. The coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) for \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, as I found earlier. The other part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which can be expanded as \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\times c^{-m} = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). Now, when we multiply this by \\(a^2b^2\\), each term in the expansion will be \\(6 \\times \\dbinom{6}{m} a^2b^2 c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is \\(6 \\times \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m}\\). Since \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} = 2^6 = 64\\), the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). So, yes, that seems correct.\n\nWait, but let me check if I'm not overcomplicating this. Alternatively, maybe I should consider that when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficients multiply. But in this case, since we're looking for a term that only involves \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and not \\(c\\), perhaps the coefficient is just the product of the coefficients from each part. But no, that's not right because the second part isn't just a constant; it's a polynomial in \\(c\\). So, when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second polynomial, each term will have a different power of \\(c\\). But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), we need to sum all the coefficients from the second polynomial and multiply by the coefficient from the first part. So, that would indeed be 6 times 64, which is 384.\n\nWait, but another way to think about it: The entire expression is a product of two polynomials, one in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the other in \\(c\\). So, when you multiply them, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by every term in the second polynomial. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial. Because each term in the second polynomial contributes its own coefficient when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial is \\(2^6 = 64\\), so 6 times 64 is 384. So, I think that's correct.\n\nWait, but let me check with an example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^1 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, expanding, it's \\((a + b)(c + 1/c)\\). The coefficient of \\(a^1b^0\\) would be 1 times the sum of coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 2, so 1*2=2. Similarly, the coefficient of \\(a^0b^1\\) would also be 1*2=2. Now, if I compute it directly, \\((a + b)(c + 1/c) = a c + a/c + b c + b/c. So, the coefficients for \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are each 2, which matches the earlier calculation. So, that seems to confirm that the approach is correct. Therefore, in the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times 64, which is 384.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me compute \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) and check the sum of coefficients. The sum of coefficients is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), so \\(\\left(1 + 1/1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\), which is correct. So, the sum is indeed 64, so 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but another thought: Is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product equal to the product of the coefficients from each part? Or is it more complicated? Because when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficients don't just multiply directly unless you're looking for the constant term or something. Wait, no, in this case, since we're looking for a term that's only in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and not involving \\(c\\), the coefficient would indeed be the coefficient from the first part times the sum of coefficients from the second part, because each term in the second part contributes its coefficient when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). So, I think that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem had asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some specific \\(k\\), then we would have to find the specific term where \\(c\\) is raised to \\(k\\). But since it's just \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\), we sum over all possible \\(c\\) terms, which gives us 64, and then multiply by 6. So, 384 is the answer.\n\nWait, but let me check if I'm not missing anything. The problem is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). We need the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the expansion is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^4 \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k \\times \\sum_{m=0}^6 \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\times c^{-m}\\). So, each term is \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}\\dbinom{6}{m} a^{4 - k}b^k c^{6 - 2m}\\). Now, we're interested in terms where \\(a^2b^2\\), so \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). So, for each \\(m\\), the term is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\dbinom{6}{m} a^2b^2 c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\dbinom{6}{m}\\) for each \\(m\\), but since we're summing over all \\(m\\), the total coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} \\times \\sum_{m=0}^6 \\dbinom{6}{m}\\). Which is 6 * 64 = 384. So, that's correct.\n\nWait, but another way to think about it: The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, since the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) has 7 terms (from \\(c^6\\) to \\(c^{-6}\\)), each with coefficients \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the sum of all these coefficients, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but to be thorough, let me compute \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) explicitly. The expansion is:\n\n\\[\n\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n\\]\n\nSo, the coefficients are \\(\\dbinom{6}{0} = 1\\), \\(\\dbinom{6}{1} = 6\\), \\(\\dbinom{6}{2} = 15\\), \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\), \\(\\dbinom{6}{4} = 15\\), \\(\\dbinom{6}{5} = 6\\), \\(\\dbinom{6}{6} = 1\\). So, the sum of these coefficients is \\(1 + 6 + 15 + 20 + 15 + 6 + 1 = 64\\), which checks out. So, the sum is indeed 64.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me consider a simpler case. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, expanding, it's \\((a^2 + 2ab + b^2)(c + 1/c)\\). The coefficient of \\(ab\\) would be 2 * (1 + 1) = 4, because each term in the second polynomial is multiplied by the \\(ab\\) term. So, that's 2 * 2 = 4, which is correct because the expansion would have 2ab * c + 2ab * 1/c, so the coefficient of \\(ab\\) is 2c + 2/c, but the coefficient itself is 2 times (1 + 1) = 4. So, that seems to confirm the approach.\n\nTherefore, I think I'm confident that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 384.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{384}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem.\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\):\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} a^2b^2 = 6 a^2b^2\n   \\]\n   So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) from \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\n2. **Consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n   \\]\n   The sum of the coefficients in this expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\):\n   \\[\n   \\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\n   \\]\n\n3. **Combine the results:**\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is the product of the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) and the sum of the coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 64 = 384\n   \\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{384}."

Wait, actually, when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is a term in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is a term in \\(c\\). So, when you multiply them together, the product will have terms that are products of \\(a^kb^{4 - k}\\) and \\(c^m\\) or \\(c^{-m}\\) terms.

Because \\(a^2b^2\\) times 1 (from the \\(c\\) part) would give \\(a^2b^2\\), while if it's multiplied by \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), it would give terms like \\(a^2b^2c\\) or \\(a^2b^2/c\\), which are different. So, actually, I think I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) and then multiply it by the coefficient 6 from the \\(a^2b^2\\) term.

So, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first part is 6a\u00b2b\u00b2, and the constant term in the second part is 20. So, multiplying them together gives 6 * 20 a\u00b2b\u00b2 = 120a\u00b2b\u00b2.

    "text": " So, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in \\((a + b)^4\\) will multiply every term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, that means that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is just the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, no, that can't be right because each term in the product would be a combination of an \\(a\\) term and a \\(c\\) term. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire sum of terms from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that's not correct because each term in the product would be \\(a^2b^2 \\times\\) something with \\(c\\). Wait, no, I think I'm overcomplicating it. Since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then the coefficient is just the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the \\(c\\) expansion, each term contributes a coefficient, and since we're just interested in the \\(a^2b^2\\) term, regardless of \\(c\\), the total coefficient would be the product of the coefficients from each part. So, the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, as we found earlier. Now, the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\). So, substituting \\(c = 1\\), we get \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the total coefficient would be 6 times 64, which is 384. Wait, that seems high. Let me double-check that. Alternatively, maybe I'm making a mistake here. Because when you have two polynomials multiplied together, the coefficient of a specific term is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each polynomial, but only if the variables match. But in this case, \\((a + b)^4\\) only has terms in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), while \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) only has terms in \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, when you multiply them, the variables are independent. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would come from multiplying \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first polynomial with every term from the second polynomial. But since the second polynomial's terms are in \\(c\\), the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would indeed be the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all coefficients in the second part. So, that would be 6 times 64, which is 384. Hmm, but let me think again. Wait, no, actually, when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second, but the variables are separate. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be \\(a^2b^2\\) times each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the coefficient from the first part, 6, multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. But wait, that's not quite right because the second part's terms are in \\(c\\), so when you multiply, you don't actually combine the exponents; you just have separate terms. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient from the first part times the entire second polynomial, but that doesn't make sense because the second polynomial is in \\(c\\), not in \\(a\\) or \\(b\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is just the coefficient from the first part, 6, because the second part doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. Wait, that seems conflicting with my earlier thought. Let me clarify.\n\nWhen you have two polynomials multiplied together, the variables are independent. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by every term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is indeed the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second polynomial, you're effectively distributing it across all the terms in the second polynomial, so the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second polynomial.\n\nSo, the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), as I did earlier, which gives \\(2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the total coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me check this with a smaller example to make sure I'm not making a mistake. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Let's compute this. Expanding \\((a + b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2\\). Expanding \\((c + 1/c)^1 = c + 1/c\\). Now, multiplying them together: \\((a^2 + 2ab + b^2)(c + 1/c)\\). So, the product is \\(a^2c + a^2/c + 2abc + 2ab/c + b^2c + b^2/c\\). Now, if I look for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but wait, there is no \\(a^2b^2\\) term here because the second polynomial only has \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), so the product doesn't have any \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) multiplied together beyond what's in \\((a + b)^2\\). So, in this case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be zero because there's no such term. But according to my earlier logic, the coefficient would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial times the sum of coefficients in the second. But in this case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^2\\) is zero because the highest power is \\(a^2\\) and \\(b^2\\), not \\(a^2b^2\\). So, that would give 0 * 2 = 0, which matches. So, that works.\n\nAnother example: \\((a + b)^3 \\times (c + 1/c)^2\\). Expanding \\((a + b)^3 = a^3 + 3a^2b + 3ab^2 + b^3\\). Expanding \\((c + 1/c)^2 = c^2 + 2 + 1/c^2\\). Now, multiplying them: each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the product will have terms like \\(a^3c^2\\), \\(a^3*2\\), \\(a^3/c^2\\), and similarly for the other terms. Now, looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would come from the term \\(3a^2b\\) multiplied by \\(2\\), giving \\(6a^2b\\), but wait, that's not \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, actually, in \\((a + b)^3\\), the term with \\(a^2b\\) is \\(3a^2b\\), and when multiplied by 2 from the second polynomial, it becomes \\(6a^2b\\). But that's still \\(a^2b\\), not \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be zero because there's no such term in the product. But according to my earlier logic, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^3\\) is zero, so 0 times the sum of coefficients in the second polynomial (which is 4) would be zero, which matches. So, that works too.\n\nWait, but in the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, so when I multiply by the sum of coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 64, I get 384. So, that seems correct.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\) as 6, and then it's multiplied by every term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, in the product, \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^6\\), \\(c^4\\), etc., but since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), that coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 64. So, 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of it as the product of the two polynomials, and since the variables are independent, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just the product of the coefficients from each part. So, 6 from the first, and the sum of coefficients from the second, which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me check if that's the case. Let me consider another example: \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + d)^1\\). The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in this product would be zero because the second polynomial doesn't have any \\(a\\) or \\(b\\) terms. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is zero, which is consistent with my earlier logic because the coefficient from the first part is 1 (for \\(a^2b^0\\) and \\(a^0b^2\\), but actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^2\\) is zero because the highest degree is 2, split between \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would be zero times the sum of coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 2, giving zero, which is correct.\n\nWait, but in our problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, so when multiplied by the sum of coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 64, we get 384. So, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of it as the product being a polynomial in \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\), and \\(1/c\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would have a coefficient that is the product of the coefficients from each part, but since the second part doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), the coefficient is just 6 times the entire expansion of the second polynomial. But since we're only interested in the coefficient, regardless of \\(c\\), it's 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me make sure. Let me compute \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) and find the sum of its coefficients. As I did before, setting \\(c = 1\\), we get \\(2^6 = 64\\). So, that's correct. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because in the initial problem, the expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, when you multiply these two, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial, which are all in \\(c\\). So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is indeed the coefficient from the first part (6) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients from the second part (64), giving 384.\n\nWait, but let me think differently. Suppose I want to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some \\(k\\), then it would be the product of the coefficients from each part. But in this problem, we're only asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\). So, that would mean we're summing over all possible \\(k\\), effectively multiplying the coefficient from the first part by the sum of coefficients from the second part.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times 64, which is 384.\n\nWait, but let me check with another approach. Let's consider the multinomial theorem. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\), as we found. Now, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, when you multiply these, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Since the sum of the coefficients is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\(2^6 = 64\\), so 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of it as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6, and since the second part doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms, the coefficient remains 6. But that doesn't seem right because when you multiply by the second polynomial, you're effectively scaling each term by the entire second polynomial. So, the coefficient should be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 64, giving 384.\n\nWait, but let me think of it another way. Suppose I have two polynomials: P(a, b) = (a + b)^4 and Q(c) = (c + 1/c)^6. Then, the product is P(a, b) * Q(c). So, when you multiply them, each term in P is multiplied by each term in Q. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in P is multiplied by each term in Q, which are in \\(c\\). So, in the product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will have a coefficient that is 6 times each coefficient in Q. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in Q, which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but I think I'm overcomplicating it. The key point is that when you have two polynomials multiplied together, the coefficient of a specific term in one set of variables is the product of the coefficients from each polynomial, provided the variables are independent. In this case, \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are in one polynomial, and \\(c\\) is in the other. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is just the coefficient from the first polynomial times the entire second polynomial. But since we're only interested in the coefficient, not the variables, it's 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 64, giving 384.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of the product as a single polynomial in variables \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\), and the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would have a coefficient that is the product of the coefficients from each part. But since the second part doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), the coefficient is just 6 times the entire expansion of the second polynomial. But since we're only interested in the coefficient, it's 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 64, giving 384.\n\nWait, but let me check once more. Let me compute \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) and find the sum of its coefficients. When \\(c = 1\\), it's \\(2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of the coefficients is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, the final answer is 384.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\) as 6, and when you multiply by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), so the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, it's 6 times the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but another way to think about it is that when you have two polynomials multiplied together, the coefficient of a term in one set of variables is the product of the coefficients from each polynomial. So, since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are in one polynomial, and \\(c\\) is in the other, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just the product of the coefficients from each part. But the second part doesn't have any \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), so it's effectively 6 times the entire second polynomial. But since we're only interested in the coefficient, it's 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 64, so 384.\n\nYes, that seems consistent. So, I think the answer is 384.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{384}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem and properties of polynomial multiplication.\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\):\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\n   \\]\n   So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\n2. **Consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   The sum of the coefficients in this expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\):\n   \\[\n   \\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\n   \\]\n\n3. **Combine the results:**\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is the product of the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) and the sum of the coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 64 = 384\n   \\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{384}\\)."

Wait, but that might not be quite right. Let me think again. When we multiply two expressions, each term in the first expression is multiplied by each term in the second expression. So, in this case, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from \\((a + b)^4\\) would be multiplied by every term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be \\(6\\) multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, no, that's not correct. Because the sum of the coefficients in a polynomial is found by setting all variables to 1. So, if I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). Wait, but that seems too straightforward. Let me check if I'm missing something. Alternatively, maybe I'm supposed to consider that the \\(c\\) terms could affect the \\(a^2b^2\\) term, but I don't think so because \\(a^2b^2\\) is independent of \\(c\\). So, when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each of those terms will have a \\(c\\) component, but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), we can just sum all the coefficients from the second part and multiply by 6. So, that would be 6 times 64, which is 384. Let me verify this another way. Alternatively, I can expand both parts separately and then multiply the specific terms. So, first, as before, \\((a + b)^4\\) gives \\(a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6. Now, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) can be expanded using the binomial theorem as \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). The sum of all the coefficients would be when \\(c = 1\\), which is 2^6 = 64, as I found earlier. Therefore, when I multiply the two expressions, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times 64, which is 384. Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term in \\((a + b)^4\\), and when multiplied by any term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the resulting term will have \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by some power of \\(c\\). But since the problem only asks for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), I think I'm correct in multiplying the coefficient from the first part by the sum of all coefficients from the second part.

But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not considering the \\(c\\) terms. Wait, that seems conflicting. Maybe I'm misunderstanding. Let me read the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, in the entire product, we need the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\).

But the problem is asking for a coefficient, which is a number, so maybe I'm missing something here.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is actually to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable, but the question is only about \\(a^2b^2\\), so the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all terms in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but that doesn't make sense because that sum would be a number, but actually, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is a polynomial in \\(c\\), so when you multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which would mean that the coefficient is a polynomial, not a single number. That can't be right because the problem is asking for a coefficient, implying a single number. Therefore, I must have misunderstood the problem. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that also doesn't make sense because the sum of coefficients in a polynomial is obtained by setting all variables to 1. So, if I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = (1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 * 64 = 384. But wait, is that correct? Let me think again. If I have \\((a + b)^4\\) times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), and I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), then in the product, each term from \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\), and it's multiplied by every term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term without \\(c\\), perhaps the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is indeed obtained by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\(2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient would be 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Since \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) are multiplied together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is simply the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and that term is present in the product as \\(6a^2b^2 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the coefficient would be 6 times the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, not a single number. However, the problem is asking for a coefficient, which is a number, so perhaps the question is actually to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable, but only considering the terms where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out, i.e., \\(c^0\\). That is, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). That would make sense because then the coefficient would be a single number. So, let me re-express the problem as: Find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). If that's the case, then I need to find the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\). So, first, from \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, as I found earlier. Now, from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), I need the coefficient of \\(c^0\\), which is the constant term. So, let me find that. Using the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(1/c\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We want the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 20. Now, since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product, we multiply the coefficients from each part: 6 (from \\(a^2b^2\\)) and 20 (from \\(c^0\\)), giving 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120. Wait, but earlier I thought the problem was just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), without considering \\(c\\). So, perhaps the answer is 120, considering the constant term in the \\(c\\) expansion. Alternatively, if the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), then it would be 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which would make the coefficient a polynomial in \\(c\\), but since the problem is asking for a coefficient, it's more likely that it's asking for the coefficient when considering all variables, which would be 120. I think that's the correct approach. So, to summarize: The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product is 6 * 20 = 120.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break down the problem as follows:\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term with \\(a^2b^2\\) occurs when \\(k = 2\\), so its coefficient is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\n   \\]\n\n2. **Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n   \\]\n   We are interested in the constant term (\\(c^0\\)), which occurs when \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), i.e., \\(k = 3\\).

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), that term is only present in \\((a + b)^4\\), and in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), any term will be a power of \\(c\\). So, when we multiply, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for various \\(k\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would only be the case if the power of \\(c\\) is zero, because otherwise, the term would involve \\(c\\) and wouldn't just be \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, but that's not possible because \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) doesn't have a constant term (i.e., a term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero). Hmm, let me check that. Let me expand \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem. So, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(1/c\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m} = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the exponents of \\(c\\) are \\(6 - 2m\\) where \\(m\\) ranges from 0 to 6. So, possible exponents are 6, 4, 2, 0, -2, -4, -6. Wait, when \\(m = 3\\), the exponent is \\(6 - 6 = 0\\). So, there is a constant term when \\(m = 3\\). So, the term where \\(m = 3\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} c^{0} = 20 \\times 1 = 20\\). So, in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the constant term is 20. Therefore, when we multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by 20, resulting in \\(20a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 20 times the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\), which was 6. Wait, no, that's not quite right. Let me clarify. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) has a coefficient of 6. Then, when we multiply by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which has a constant term of 20, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by 20, giving a coefficient of \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 120. Wait, but let me make sure I'm not missing anything. So, the product is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). When we expand this, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6a\u00b2b\u00b2. Then, when multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which includes a term 20 (when \\(m=3\\)), so 6a\u00b2b\u00b2 \u00d7 20 = 120a\u00b2b\u00b2. But wait, are there any other terms in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) that could contribute to a term without \\(c\\)? No, because the only term without \\(c\\) is the constant term, which is 20. So, all other terms in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) have positive or negative exponents of \\(c\\), so when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), they would result in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) where \\(k\\) is non-zero. Therefore, the only term contributing to \\(a^2b^2\\) is from the constant term in the second expansion, which is 20. So, the coefficient is 6 \u00d7 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120. Wait, let me double-check my calculations. The binomial coefficient for \\((a + b)^4\\) at \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). For \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the constant term occurs when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, which happens when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), so \\(m = 3\\). The coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, yes, 6 \u00d7 20 = 120.

Alternatively, another way to think about it is that when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in one polynomial is multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the other polynomial. So, since we're only interested in the \\(a^2b^2\\) term, which has a coefficient of 6, and the other polynomial's sum of coefficients is 64, the total coefficient is 6*64=384.

Thus, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n\\boxed{384}"

Wait, no, that might not be accurate because the second part isn't just a constant; it's a sum of terms with different powers of \\(c\\). So, when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the expansion will have a combination of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) from the first part and \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) from the second part. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), that term would be the coefficient from the first part times the entire expansion of the second part. Wait, no, that can't be right because when you multiply, each term is a product of a term from the first expansion and a term from the second expansion. So, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the product would come from the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first expansion multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, the coefficient would be the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Wait, no, that's not correct either because each term in the second expansion has different powers of \\(c\\), but when you multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), each term would be \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2c^{-k}\\) for some \\(k\\), but since the problem only asks for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), we need to consider all possible terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any power of \\(c\\). But that seems like the entire expansion would have multiple terms involving \\(a^2b^2\\) with different powers of \\(c\\). Wait, but maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, considering all possible powers of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient would be the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all coefficients from the second part because each term in the second part is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). But wait, the second part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which expands to terms like \\(c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15c^{-2} + 6c^{-4} + c^{-6}\\). So, the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion is \\(1 + 6 + 15 + 20 + 15 + 6 + 1 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, multiplied by 64, giving 384. Wait, but I'm not sure if that's correct because I'm not sure if I'm allowed to just sum all the coefficients in the second expansion and multiply by the coefficient from the first. Let me think again. When you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum of the products of the coefficients of terms whose variables multiply to give that specific term. But in this case, the specific term is \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\). So, in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the product of \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion and each term from the second expansion. So, each term in the second expansion is a coefficient times some power of \\(c\\), and when you multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), you get terms like \\(6a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(6a^2b^2c^4\\), etc. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in other words, it's the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for any \\(k\\). But since the problem doesn't specify a particular power of \\(c\\), just \\(a^2b^2\\), I think the coefficient would be the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all coefficients from the second part. Because each term in the second part contributes a coefficient that, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), gives a term with \\(a^2b^2\\) and some power of \\(c\\). So, the total coefficient for all terms involving \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\) would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion. As I calculated earlier, the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion is 64, so 6 times 64 is 384. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 384. Wait, but let me double-check this because I might be confusing the way the coefficients combine. Another way to think about it is: when you have two polynomials, say P(a, b) and Q(c), their product is P(a, b) * Q(c). So, any term in the product will be a term from P times a term from Q. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is equal to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in P(a, b) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in Q(c). Because for each term in Q(c), which is a coefficient times some power of c, when you multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), you get \\(a^2b^2\\) times that coefficient times c^k. So, if you collect all such terms, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of c would be the coefficient from P times the sum of coefficients from Q. So, that makes sense. Therefore, the coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384. Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, if the problem had asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for a specific k, then we would have to multiply the coefficients from each expansion corresponding to that k. But since it's just \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of c, we sum all coefficients from the second expansion and multiply by 6. So, I think 384 is the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(64\\). Multiplying these gives \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\boxed{384}."

Because if you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by any term involving \\(c\\), it would introduce \\(c\\) terms, which we don't want. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I already found that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. Now, I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). To find the constant term, I can again use the binomial theorem. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying each term, that becomes \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m} = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the exponent of \\(c\\) in each term is \\(6 - 2m\\). We need the term where the exponent is 0, because that's the constant term. So, set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20. Now, going back to the original expression, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the product of the two coefficients we found. That is, 6 (from \\((a + b)^4\\)) multiplied by 20 (from the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)). So, 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120. Wait, let me make sure I didn't miss anything.

But that doesn't seem right because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\). So, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. Wait, maybe I need to consider that when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).

Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When you expand this, each term from \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second part. But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a specific term in the product, but \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), so in the product, \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Wait, that makes sense because when you multiply a term by a polynomial, the coefficient of that term in the product is the original coefficient times the sum of the coefficients of the other polynomial. So, the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) can be found by plugging in \\(c = 1\\), because that gives the sum of the coefficients. Let me check that. If \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = (2)^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of the coefficients in the second part is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 (from the first part) times 64 (from the second part), which is 6 * 64 = 384. So, the coefficient is 384. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't miss anything. Is there a possibility that when I multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by terms in the second polynomial, I might get other terms involving \\(c\\), but the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term without \\(c\\). So, actually, in the product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in the second polynomial, but since the second polynomial has terms with different powers of \\(c\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) itself will have coefficients multiplied by each of those terms. But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term without any \\(c\\), that means we're only interested in the part where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by the constant term in the second polynomial. Wait, that's different from what I thought earlier. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part. Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by \\(c^k\\) from the second part, you get \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), but the only term where \\(c^k\\) is \\(c^0\\) is the constant term, which is the term where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out. So, actually, I think I made a mistake earlier by considering the sum of all coefficients. Instead, I should find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because that's the only term that, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), will result in a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\). So, let me correct that. First, find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, as I calculated before. Then, find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). To do that, I can use the binomial theorem again. Let me expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem, this is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so we set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\), which is \\(\\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the second part), which is 6 * 20 = 120. So, the coefficient is 120. Wait, but earlier I thought it was 384, but now I'm getting 120. Which one is correct? Let me double-check. The key point is whether the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms or only the coefficient when multiplied by \\(c^0\\). Since the problem is written as \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), and it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term without \\(c\\), that means we're looking for the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\), because any other power of \\(c\\) would make the term have \\(c\\) in it, which isn't part of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, yes, the correct approach is to multiply the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part. Therefore, 6 * 20 = 120 is the correct coefficient. So, I think I made a mistake earlier by considering the sum of all coefficients, which would have given me 384, but that's incorrect because the problem specifically wants the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is only affected by the constant term in the second polynomial. So, the correct answer is 120.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break down the problem into two parts:\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\), so its coefficient is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\n   \\]\n\n2. **Find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n   \\]\n   The constant term occurs when \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\).

So, from \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient is 6, and from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the constant term is 20. Therefore, the total coefficient is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Wait, but let me double-check that. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first part, which is 6, and when multiplied by the constant term in the second part, which is 20, so 6 times 20 is indeed 120. So, I think that's the answer. But just to make sure I didn't make a mistake, let me recap. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 20. So, when you multiply the two expressions, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by 20, resulting in 6*20 = 120. Yeah, that seems right. I don't think I made any calculation errors here. So, the coefficient is 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem.\n\nFirst, consider the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n\\]\nWe need the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2.

Because if you take any other term from the second polynomial, which has \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), then when you multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), it would result in a term that includes \\(c\\), which isn't part of \\(a^2b^2\\).

That makes sense because when you multiply two polynomials, the constant term in each contributes to the constant term in the product. So, I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me figure that out. Using the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying each term, that becomes \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m} = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the exponent on \\(c\\) is \\(6 - 2m\\). We need the term where the exponent is zero because that's the constant term. So, set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\) so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is when \\(m = 3\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20.

So, that would be 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the second part). Calculating that, 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120. Let me just double-check that I didn't make any mistakes. For \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). For \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the constant term is when the exponent on \\(c\\) is zero, which happens at \\(m = 3\\), and \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying them together, 6 * 20 = 120.

Wait, that seems a bit confusing. Let me think again. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when you expand this, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).

That makes sense because \\(a^2b^2\\) times the constant term in the second polynomial would be the only term contributing to \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. So, now I need to find two things: 1. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which I already found as 6. 2. The coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me work on the second part.

I need the term where the exponent is 0, so set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is when \\(m = 3\\), and the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20.

But since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), that would mean that the coefficient is just the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, is that correct? Let me think. When you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each polynomial. But in this case, since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term from the first polynomial, and we're looking for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, the \\(c\\) terms can be anything because they don't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) exponents. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but is that accurate? Let me check. Alternatively, maybe I should consider that each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part would be multiplied by every term in the second part. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second polynomial, the coefficient gets multiplied by each term's coefficient, and then you sum them all. So, the total coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Now, to find the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), I can substitute \\(c = 1\\). Because substituting 1 into the polynomial gives the sum of its coefficients. So, let me compute that. Substituting \\(c = 1\\) into \\(\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = (1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 64. So, going back, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 * 64 = 384. Wait, but let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. Because when I expand \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, each of which has some power of \\(c\\). But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\), then yes, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, giving 384. Alternatively, maybe I can think of it as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for any \\(k\\), but since the problem doesn't specify any constraint on \\(c\\), it's just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\). So, that would mean the answer is 384. Wait, but let me check my steps again to make sure I didn't skip anything or make a miscalculation. So, step by step: 1. Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using binomial theorem. The term with \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient is 6. 2. Now, the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). The expansion of this is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(1/c\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, each term in this expansion has a coefficient \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\) and a power of \\(c^{6 - 2m}\\). 3. Now, when we multiply the two polynomials together, each term from the first (like \\(a^2b^2\\)) is multiplied by each term from the second (like \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\)). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first polynomial will be multiplied by each term in the second, resulting in terms like \\(6a^2b^2 \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\). 4. Since we're interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), we need to sum all the coefficients from the second polynomial, because each term will contribute a multiple of \\(a^2b^2\\) with different powers of \\(c\\). Therefore, the total coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial. 5. The sum of coefficients in the second polynomial is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), as I did earlier: \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). 6. So, the total coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384. Wait, but another way to think about it is: when you have two polynomials multiplied together, the coefficient of a specific term (like \\(a^2b^2\\)) is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each polynomial, but in this case, since the second polynomial doesn't have \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is just the coefficient from the first polynomial times the sum of all coefficients from the second polynomial. That makes sense because each term in the second polynomial contributes a multiple to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, yes, I think 384 is correct. Let me just confirm the calculation: 6 * 64. 6 times 60 is 360, and 6 times 4 is 24, so 360 + 24 = 384. Yep, that's correct. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplying it by the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 64. Thus, the total coefficient is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n\\(\\boxed{384}\\)"

But that would make the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) equal to \\(6 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't seem right because coefficients are numerical, not expressions involving variables. Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, treating \\(c\\) as a variable, so the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would have a coefficient that is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem doesn't specify; it just asks for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Alternatively, maybe the problem is considering the product as a single expression and wants the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms.

So, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, considering all possible \\(c\\) exponents. But that would mean the coefficient is the product of the coefficients from each part, as the \\(a^2b^2\\) term is multiplied by each term in the \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) expansion. But that would mean the coefficient is \\(6 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial in \\(c\\).

But that would make the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) equal to \\(6 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial, not a single number. So, that can't be right. Maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, considering that \\(c\\) is another variable, so the coefficient would be a sum over all possible \\(c\\) terms.

But in this case, since \\((a + b)^4\\) only has terms up to \\(a^4\\) and \\(b^4\\), and the other part is in terms of \\(c\\), maybe the \\(a^2b^2\\) term is only present once, multiplied by the entire \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) expansion.

But that doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a single coefficient.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me think again. The problem is: What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the expression is the product of two expansions: one in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the other in \\(c\\). So, when you multiply them, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion comes with a coefficient of 6, as we found earlier. Then, when you multiply this by each term in the second expansion, which is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in that expansion has a coefficient, say \\(k\\), and a power of \\(c\\). So, when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each of these terms, you get terms like \\(6k a^2b^2c^n\\), where \\(n\\) is the exponent of \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would include all the terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present, regardless of the \\(c\\) exponent. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the sum of all the coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by 6. But that would mean the coefficient is \\(6 \\times\\) the sum of the coefficients of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But the sum of the coefficients of a polynomial is found by setting all variables to 1. So, if we set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of the coefficients is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). But wait, is that correct? Because the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times each coefficient from the second expansion, but actually, each term in the second expansion is a coefficient times \\(c^k\\), so when you multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), each term becomes \\(6k a^2b^2c^k\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the sum of all \\(6k\\) where \\(k\\) is the coefficient from the second expansion. But that sum is 6 times the sum of the coefficients of the second expansion, which is 6 \u00d7 64 = 384. So, is that the answer? Let me check.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 6 \u00d7 (c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15/c^2 + 6/c^4 + 1/c^6). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times that polynomial, which would give 6c^6 + 36c^4 + 90c^2 + 120 + 90/c^2 + 36/c^4 + 6/c^6. But that seems too involved, and the problem probably expects a numerical coefficient, not a polynomial. So, perhaps the correct approach is to realize that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the sum of the coefficients of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 6 \u00d7 64 = 384. Therefore, the coefficient is 384.\n\nWait, but let me verify that. The sum of the coefficients of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is indeed found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\(2^6 = 64\\). So, 6 \u00d7 64 = 384.

So, I think that's the answer.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplying it by the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The sum of the coefficients in the second expression is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), giving \\(2^6 = 64\\). Thus, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n\\boxed{384}"

So, I think I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me try to find that. Using the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\).

So, in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from multiplying the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part by the entire second part.

That would make sense. So, perhaps I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) and then multiply it by 6 to get the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Let me check that logic. If I have \\((a + b)^4\\) which gives me \\(a^2b^2\\) with coefficient 6, and then I multiply it by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), then the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times \\(a^2b^2\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).

But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make much sense because the problem is likely expecting a numerical coefficient.

Therefore, I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, as I found earlier. Now, I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me expand that using the binomial theorem. So, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). Now, I need to find the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, because that's the constant term. So, set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\) so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, which includes all possible terms with \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by any combination of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\).

So, perhaps I'm misinterpreting the question. Maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where the exponents of \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are 2, 2, and 0 respectively. That would make more sense because then we're looking for a specific term. Alternatively, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. But that would mean that the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which seems unusual. Let me try to clarify. The problem says: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), treating \\(c\\) as another variable.

Maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, which would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). As I thought earlier, the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\(2^6 = 64\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 * 64 = 384. But I'm not entirely sure if that's correct because the problem might be expecting a different approach. Alternatively, maybe I should consider that the entire expression is a product of two polynomials, and the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient from the first polynomial times the entire second polynomial. So, that would mean the coefficient is 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would make the coefficient a polynomial, not a constant. So, perhaps the problem is expecting just the numerical coefficient, ignoring the \\(c\\) terms, which would be 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, maybe I should consider that the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial, so the coefficient would be 6 times the entire second polynomial. But that seems too broad. Let me try to think of it another way. Let's consider the entire product:\n\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\left(\\sum_{i=0}^4 \\dbinom{4}{i} a^{4 - i}b^i\\right) \\left(\\sum_{j=0}^6 \\dbinom{6}{j} c^{6 - j} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^j\\right)\n\\]\n\nSimplifying the second sum:\n\n\\[\n\\sum_{j=0}^6 \\dbinom{6}{j} c^{6 - 2j}\n\\]\n\nSo, the product becomes:\n\n\\[\n\\sum_{i=0}^4 \\sum_{j=0}^6 \\dbinom{4}{i}\\dbinom{6}{j} a^{4 - i}b^i c^{6 - 2j}\n\\]\n\nWe are interested in the term where \\(a^{4 - i}b^i\\) is \\(a^2b^2\\), which implies \\(4 - i = 2\\) and \\(i = 2\\). So, \\(i = 2\\). Now, for each such term, we have \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by \\(c^{6 - 2j}\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, that would mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the sum over all \\(j\\) of the coefficients from the second polynomial multiplied by \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). So, the coefficient would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) times the sum over \\(j\\) of \\(\\dbinom{6}{j}\\). But the sum over \\(j\\) of \\(\\dbinom{6}{j}\\) is \\(2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 384. Alternatively, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then we would need to find the term where \\(6 - 2j = 0\\), so \\(j = 3\\). In that case, the coefficient would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Let me calculate that: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\), \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\), so 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is 120. But the problem didn't specify the \\(c\\) term, so I'm not sure which interpretation is correct. However, given that the problem is written as \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), and it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I think the intended answer is 384, considering that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient from the first polynomial times the entire expansion of the second polynomial. But I'm not entirely confident. Alternatively, maybe the problem is expecting the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without considering the \\(c\\) terms, which would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 6 * 64 = 384. So, I think that's the answer.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) has a sum of coefficients equal to \\(2^6 = 64\\).

Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me think again. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, if I expand both parts separately, each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is only present in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\), and it will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of the second part. But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term in the product, it would be the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all coefficients from the second part. Wait, no, because each term in the second part is a separate term involving \\(c\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would actually be the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, each of those will contribute to different terms in the final product, but since we're only interested in \\(a^2b^2\\), we need to consider how it's multiplied by the entire second expansion.

Wait, but that doesn't sound right because the second part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me think differently. Let me consider that the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when you multiply these two expressions, each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\) with coefficient 6, as I found earlier. Now, when I multiply this term by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each of those will contribute to different terms in the final product. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term without \\(c\\), that would only happen if the term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(c^0\\), i.e., the constant term. Because if we multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by \\(c^k\\) or \\(c^{-k}\\), the result will have a \\(c\\) term, which is not what we want.

We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Let me compute that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Now, going back to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) and the constant term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, that would be \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Wait, is that correct? Let me double-check. So, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. In \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the constant term is 20. Therefore, when you multiply these two expressions, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part, but only the constant term in the second part will result in a term that is \\(a^2b^2 \\times 1\\), which is \\(a^2b^2\\). All other terms will have a \\(c\\) component, which we don't want. Therefore, the coefficient is indeed \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is 120.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break down the problem as follows:\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\):\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} a^{2}b^{2} = 6a^2b^2\n   \\]\n   So, the coefficient is 6.\n\n2. **Find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n   \\]\n   The constant term occurs when the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0:\n   \\[\n   6 - 2k = 0 \\implies k = 3\n   \\]\n   The coefficient is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\n   \\]\n\n3. **Multiply the coefficients:**\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is:\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 20 = 120\n   \\]\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}."

    "text": " So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will come from multiplying the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in \\((a + b)^4\\) by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be \\(6\\) times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that can't be right because the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) would be when \\(c = 1\\), which would be \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). But that would make the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) equal to \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\), which seems too high. Maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)\". So, perhaps the question is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). That is, when you expand the entire expression, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) times any power of \\(c\\) is just the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 64. So, the coefficient would be \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). But I'm not sure if that's correct because the problem might be implying that we need to consider the entire expansion, including the \\(c\\) terms, but the question is only about \\(a^2b^2\\), so maybe it's just the product of the coefficients. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only considering the terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\), i.e., the constant term in the \\(c\\) part. That would make more sense because otherwise, the coefficient would depend on the power of \\(c\\), but the question is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some \\(k\\). So, maybe I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). That would make the coefficient \\(6\\) times the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, let me find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). The constant term occurs when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which implies \\(m = 3\\). So, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Wait, that makes sense. So, the coefficient is 120. Let me check that again. The expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) gives \\(a^2b^2\\) with coefficient 6. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) has a constant term when \\(m = 3\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, when you multiply the two expansions, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by each term of the second expansion. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, or specifically, the term where the \\(c\\) part is constant, then the coefficient would be 6 times 20, which is 120. Alternatively, if we were to consider all possible powers of \\(c\\), the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 times 64, which is 384. But I think the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, so it's 120. Let me see if that's correct. Another way to think about it is that when you expand the entire product, each term will be of the form \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}a^{4 - k}b^k \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, for the term \\(a^2b^2\\), we need \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\), as before. Then, the coefficient for that term in the product would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}\\), but only when the \\(c\\) term is such that it doesn't affect the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. Wait, no, actually, the \\(c\\) terms are separate. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the sum over all \\(m\\) of \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}\\), but that would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} \\times \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m}\\), which is 6 times 64, giving 384. But that seems contradictory. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), i.e., the term where the \\(c\\) part is constant. In that case, the coefficient would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} \\times \\dbinom{6}{3} = 6 \\times 20 = 120\\). So, I think that's the correct interpretation. Therefore, the coefficient is 120.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break down the problem as follows:\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term containing \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\):\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\n   \\]\n   So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in this part is 6.\n\n2. **Find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   Using the binomial theorem:\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n   \\]\n   The constant term occurs when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero:\n   \\[\n   6 - 2m = 0 \\implies m = 3\n   \\]\n   The constant term is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\n   \\]\n\n3. **Combine the coefficients:**\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficients from each part:\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 20 = 120\n   \\]\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

    "text": " But since we're only looking for \\(a^2b^2\\), which has no \\(c\\) terms, that would mean we need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by the constant term in the second polynomial, you get \\(a^2b^2\\) times that constant, which is the term we're interested in. So, perhaps the overall coefficient is 6 times the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me check that. So, first, I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Again, using the binomial theorem: \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). The constant term is where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which gives \\(m = 3\\). So, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (the constant term from the second part). So, 6 times 20 is 120. Wait, is that correct? Let me make sure I'm not missing anything. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the first part, and the constant term comes only from the second part, so when multiplied together, it's 6 * 20 = 120. That seems right. Alternatively, maybe I can think of it as the entire expression being the product of two separate expansions, so each term in the first expansion multiplies each term in the second. But since we're only interested in the term with \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), we can just take the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and multiply it by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part, which is the constant term. So, that would be 6 * 20 = 120. Hmm, that makes sense. Let me see if there's another way to approach it, just to be thorough. Alternatively, maybe I can expand both expressions fully and then look for the \\(a^2b^2\\) term, but that would be more work. But perhaps doing it that way can confirm my answer. So, expanding \\((a + b)^4\\), we have terms from \\(a^4\\) down to \\(b^4\\). The term with \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\\). Then, expanding \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we have terms from \\(c^6\\) down to \\(c^{-6}\\) with various coefficients. The constant term is when the exponent is zero, which, as I found earlier, is when \\(m = 3\\), giving \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), the only term that contributes is the constant term from the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120. So, that seems consistent. Wait, but let me think again: when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the product will have terms that are products of terms from each expansion. So, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is of the form \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}a^{4 - k}b^k\\) and each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is of the form \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, when you multiply these together, each term in the product is \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}\\dbinom{6}{m}a^{4 - k}b^k c^{6 - 2m}\\). Now, we're looking for the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2, which implies \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\), so that's correct. So, the term is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\dbinom{6}{m}a^2b^2c^{6 - 2m}\\). But we want the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the exponent of \\(c\\). Wait, no, that's not correct. Wait, no, because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\) at all. So, that would mean that the exponent of \\(c\\) must be zero, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which gives \\(m = 3\\). So, the only term that contributes to \\(a^2b^2\\) is when \\(m = 3\\), so the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\dbinom{6}{3}\\), which is 6 * 20 = 120. So, that's correct. I think that's thorough enough.
