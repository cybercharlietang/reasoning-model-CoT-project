So, I'm expanding two separate expressions and then multiplying them together. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the product of the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first expansion and the constant term in the second expansion, right? Because any other term in the second expansion would have a power of \\(c\\), which would make the product have a term involving \\(c\\), but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), we can ignore all other terms in the second expansion except the constant term. That makes sense because when you multiply two polynomials, each term in one polynomial multiplies each term in the other, and only when the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out (i.e., \\(c^0\\)) will the product term not have any \\(c\\) in it.

When we multiply these two expressions, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial will be multiplied by every term in the second polynomial. However, since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), we need to find the term in the second polynomial that doesn't involve \\(c\\) either, i.e., the constant term. That's what I did earlier, finding the coefficient of \\(c^0\\), which is 20. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by 20, giving 6 * 20 = 120. That seems right. Alternatively, if I were to expand the entire expression, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term would only come from that specific combination, so I don't think there are any other contributions to the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. So, I think 120 is the correct coefficient.\n\nJust to be thorough, let me consider if there's another way to approach this problem. Maybe by expanding both parts separately and then looking for the coefficient. But that seems more complicated because the second part has terms with \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), which would require more steps. Alternatively, perhaps using multinomial coefficients?

So, multiplying them together: 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120.\n\nWait, let me double-check that I didn't make a mistake.

I don't think I made any errors here.\n\nJust to make sure, let me think about it another way. If I were to expand \\((a + b)^4\\), the expansion would be \\(a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6. Now, the other part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), when expanded, will have terms from \\(c^6\\) down to \\(c^{-6}\\) in steps of 2. The middle term, where the exponent is 0, is the 4th term (since m goes from 0 to 6). The coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\), so that's correct. Therefore, when I multiply the two expansions together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will only multiply the constant term from the second part to give a term that's just \\(a^2b^2\\). All other terms from the second expansion would introduce a \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\) term, so they wouldn't contribute to the \\(a^2b^2\\) term.

That seems correct.\n\nI think I might have confused myself a bit when considering whether the \\(c\\) terms affect the coefficient, but I realized that since we're only interested in the \\(a^2b^2\\) term, any other terms involving \\(c\\) would just multiply it, but we're only asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so those other factors must be constants or have exponents that cancel out to \\(c^0\\). So, yeah, I think I did it right.\n\nAnother way to think about it is that the entire expression is a product of two independent expansions. So, when you multiply them, each term in the first expansion multiplies each term in the second. But since we're only interested in the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2, we can ignore all other terms except the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first expansion and the \\(c^0\\) term from the second expansion.

Let me just verify the binomial coefficients again. \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) is 6 because 4 choose 2 is 6. \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\) is 20 because 6 choose 3 is 20. So, 6 times 20 is indeed 120. So, I think that's the correct answer.\n\nWait, just to make sure, let me consider an alternative approach. Let's say I expand both expressions fully and then look for the term \\(a^2b^2\\). But that seems more complicated because expanding both would take a lot of time. Alternatively, I can think of the entire expression as \\((a + b)^4\\) times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). When I expand this, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion will be multiplied by all terms in the second expansion. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), we need to find the term in the second expansion that doesn't involve \\(c\\), which is the constant term, as we found earlier. So, that term is 20, and so the coefficient becomes 6 * 20 = 120. Yeah, that still makes sense.\n\nI guess another way to think about it is that the entire expression is a product of two polynomials, and when you multiply them, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum of the products of the coefficients of terms whose exponents add up to the desired term. But in this case, since we're looking for \\(a^2b^2\\) and it's only present in the first polynomial, and we need the constant term from the second polynomial, there's only one such product, which is 6 * 20.

The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Since these two terms are multiplied together in the product, the overall coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Let me double-check to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. So, first part: \\((a + b)^4\\), coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). That seems right. Second part: \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), looking for \\(c^0\\), so exponent is 0, which occurs when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying 6 and 20 gives 120. Hmm, that seems correct. I don't think I missed anything here. So, the final coefficient should be 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break down the problem into two parts using the binomial theorem.\n\nFirst, consider the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\). Using the binomial theorem, we have:\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n\\]\nWe need the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which corresponds to \\(k = 2\\). This coefficient is:\n\\[\n\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\n\\]\n\nNext, consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem, we have:\n\\[\n\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n\\]\nWe need the coefficient of \\(c^0\\), which occurs when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(m = 3\\). This coefficient is:\n\\[\n\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\n\\]\n\nThe overall coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the two coefficients found:\n\\[\n6 \\times 20 = 120\n\\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."
