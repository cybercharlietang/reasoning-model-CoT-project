    "text": " So, the coefficient from the second part is 20. Now, putting it all together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the two coefficients we found: 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the second part). So, 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120.\n\nWait, let me double-check that. So, I found that in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, and in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Multiplying them gives 6*20=120. That seems correct. Alternatively, maybe I can think of the entire expression as \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). When I multiply these two, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part comes from \\(k=2\\) as I found, and to get a term without \\(c\\), I need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero in the second part, which is when \\(m=3\\). So, the product of these two terms is indeed 6*20=120. So, I think that's the right answer.\n\nWait, another way to think about it is: the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), we can treat the second part as a constant when considering the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. But actually, that's not exactly correct because the second part is a polynomial in \\(c\\), but when multiplied by the first part, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will be multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, we need to consider all the terms in the second polynomial, but only the one that doesn't introduce any \\(c\\) terms. So, that's why we need the constant term from the second polynomial, which is 20. So, again, 6*20=120.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can consider the entire expansion. Let me write out the expansion of both parts and see if I can find the term. So, \\((a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6. Now, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) expands to \\(c^6 + 6c^5 \\times (1/c) + 15c^4 \\times (1/c)^2 + 20c^3 \\times (1/c)^3 + 15c^2 \\times (1/c)^4 + 6c \\times (1/c)^5 + (1/c)^6\\). Simplifying each term: \\(c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15/c^2 + 6/c^4 + 1/c^6\\). So, the constant term is 20, as I found earlier. So, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second part. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), we only need to consider the term where the second part contributes a constant term. That is, 20. So, 6 * 20 = 120. So, that seems to confirm my earlier result.\n\nWait, but another thought: when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term is the product of the coefficients of the terms that multiply together to form that term. So, in this case, to get \\(a^2b^2\\), we need to take the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from \\((a + b)^4\\) and multiply it by the term that doesn't involve \\(c\\) from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, yes, that's exactly what I did. So, I think I'm confident that the coefficient is 120.\n\nWait, just to make sure I didn't make a mistake in calculating the binomial coefficients. So, \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) is 6, correct? Yes, because 4! / (2!2!) = (24)/(2*2) = 6. And \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\) is 20, because 6! / (3!3!) = (720)/(6*6) = 720/36 = 20. So, that's correct. So, 6*20=120. Yep, that's right.\n\nWait, another way to think about it: suppose I consider the entire expression as a product of two polynomials. So, the first is in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), the second in \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). When you multiply them, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first part will be multiplied by every term in the second part, but only the constant term will result in a term that's \\(a^2b^2\\) times 1, which is just \\(a^2b^2\\). All other terms will have \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\) factors, which would make the term have \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) where \\(k \\neq 0\\), which we don't want. So, only the constant term from the second polynomial contributes to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient is indeed 6*20=120.\n\nI think that's solid. So, the final answer is 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem.\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\):\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\n   \\]\n   So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\n2. **Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n   \\]\n   We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0:\n   \\[\n   6 - 2m = 0 \\implies m = 3\n   \\]\n   The coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\n   \\]\n\n3. **Combine the coefficients:**\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficients from both expansions:\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 20 = 120\n   \\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}."

So, 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120. Let me just double-check my reasoning to make sure I didn't make a mistake. First, I correctly identified that the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\(k=2\\) in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\), giving a coefficient of 6. Then, for the second part, I correctly identified that the term \\(c^0\\) comes from \\(m=3\\), giving a coefficient of 20. Multiplying these together gives 120, which seems correct. I don't think I made any calculation errors here. So, yeah, I think 120 is the right answer.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression is found by considering the binomial expansions of each part separately and then multiplying the relevant coefficients.\n\n1. **Expanding \\((a + b)^4\\):**\n   - The term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\) in the binomial expansion.\n   - Coefficient: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n\n2. **Expanding \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   - We look for the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0.\n   - This occurs when \\(m = 3\\), giving the coefficient \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n\n3. **Combining the coefficients:**\n   - Multiply the coefficients from both expansions: \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

Now, going back to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the two coefficients we found: 6 (from \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\)) and 20 (from \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)). So, 6 multiplied by 20 is 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is 120. Wait, let me double-check that. I found that the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) it's 20, so 6 * 20 is indeed 120. Yeah, that seems right.

    "text": " So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Now, putting it all together: the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part is 20. Since we're multiplying these two expressions together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by the constant term from the second expression, which is 20. So, the overall coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120. Wait, but let me double-check that. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first part with coefficient 6, and the term \\(c^0\\) comes from the second part with coefficient 20. When we multiply these two terms together, we get \\(6 * 20 = 120\\) as the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\). That seems right. I don't think I made any mistakes in the calculations. Let me just recap to make sure: 1. Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using binomial theorem, find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is 6. 2.
