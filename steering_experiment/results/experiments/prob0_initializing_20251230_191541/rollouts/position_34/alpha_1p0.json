Let me double-check that calculation. Wait, 6! is 720, 3! is 6, so 6!/(3!3!) is 720/(6*6) = 720/36, which is indeed 20. So, the coefficient is 20.\n\nSo, now, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the two coefficients we found: 6 (from \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\)) and 20 (from \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\)). So, 6 multiplied by 20 is 120.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\) with coefficient 6, and when we multiply by the term from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) that has \\(c^0\\), which is 20, so 6*20=120. That seems right.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of the entire expression as the product of two polynomials, and when we multiply them, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will only be affected by the constant term in the second polynomial, because any other term would introduce a \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), which would make the term not purely \\(a^2b^2\\). So, yes, that makes sense.\n\nWait, but just to be thorough, let me consider if there's any other term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) that could contribute to \\(a^2b^2\\) when multiplied by a term from \\((a + b)^4\\). For example, if I take a term from \\((a + b)^4\\) with \\(a^k b^{4 - k}\\) and a term from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) with \\(c^m\\), then the product would have \\(a^k b^{4 - k} c^m\\). But since we're looking for the term with \\(a^2b^2\\), that would require \\(k = 2\\) and \\(4 - k = 2\\), so \\(k = 2\\), and \\(m = 0\\), because \\(c^m\\) has to be \\(c^0\\) to not affect the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). So, yes, only the constant term from the second polynomial contributes to the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the product. So, the coefficient is indeed 6*20=120.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't miss anything else. Let me check the binomial coefficients again.\n\nFor \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Correct.\n\nFor \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term with \\(c^0\\) is when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), so \\(m = 3\\), and the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Correct.\n\nMultiplying 6 and 20 gives 120. So, I think that's the correct coefficient.\n\nWait, but let me think again. The problem is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, when we expand this product, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, but only the term with \\(c^0\\) will result in a term that's purely \\(a^2b^2\\). All other terms will have \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\) factors, which would make the term not \\(a^2b^2\\). So, yes, only the constant term from the second expansion contributes. Therefore, the coefficient is 6*20=120.\n\nAlternatively, if I consider the entire expansion, the coefficient would be 6*20=120. So, I think that's correct.\n\nWait, but maybe I should write out the expansion to make sure. Let me try that.\n\nFirst, expand \\((a + b)^4\\):\n\n\\((a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\).\n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6.\n\nNow, expand \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\):\n\nUsing the binomial theorem, as before, the expansion is:\n\n\\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\times \\left(1/c\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\).\n\nSo, the terms are:\n\n- \\(m=0\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{0}c^6 = 1 \\times c^6\\)\n- \\(m=1\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{1}c^4 = 6c^4\\)\n- \\(m=2\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{2}c^2 = 15c^2\\)\n- \\(m=3\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}c^0 = 20\\)\n- \\(m=4\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{4}c^{-2} = 15c^{-2}\\)\n- \\(m=5\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{5}c^{-4} = 6c^{-4}\\)\n- \\(m=6\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{6}c^{-6} = 1c^{-6}\\)\n\nSo, the constant term is 20, as we found earlier.\n\nNow, when we multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. So, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first polynomial (which is \\(6a^2b^2\\)) will be multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. But we're only interested in the terms that result in \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms. So, that would only happen when we multiply \\(6a^2b^2\\) by the constant term 20 in the second polynomial. So, \\(6a^2b^2 \\times 20 = 120a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient is indeed 120.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me think if there's any other term that could contribute. For example, if I take \\(a^4\\) from the first polynomial and multiply it by \\(c^{-4}\\) from the second polynomial, that would give \\(a^4c^{-4}\\), which doesn't affect the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. Similarly, taking \\(a^3b\\) and multiplying by \\(c^{-2}\\) would give \\(a^3bc^{-2}\\), which again isn't \\(a^2b^2\\). So, no, only the \\(a^2b^2\\) term multiplied by the constant term in the second polynomial contributes to \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product.
