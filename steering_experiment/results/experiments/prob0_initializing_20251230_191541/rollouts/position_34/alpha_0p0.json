So, 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120. Wait, let me just make sure I didn't make a mistake.

So, I think the coefficient is 120.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me go through it again. So, the first part: \\((a + b)^4\\). The term \\(a^2b^2\\) is when we choose 2 a's and 2 b's. The number of ways is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) which is 6. Correct. Then, the second part: \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). We need the term where the exponents of c cancel out, so \\(c^{6 - 2m}\\) equals \\(c^0\\). So, 6 - 2m = 0, so m = 3. The coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\) which is 20. Correct. So, when you multiply the two, 6 * 20 = 120. So, yeah, 120 is the coefficient. I think that's right.\n\nAnother way to think about it: The entire expression is a product of two expansions. When you multiply them, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term can only come from multiplying the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first expansion by the constant term in the second expansion. Since the second expansion doesn't have any a or b terms, all other terms would introduce c or 1/c, which would change the variables involved. So, only the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part and the constant term from the second part contribute to the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the product.

So, I considered that the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from multiplying the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first part by the constant term in the second part. That makes sense because any other term in the second part would introduce a \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\) term, which would make the entire product have a \\(c\\) component, but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), those other terms wouldn't contribute to that specific term. Therefore, I only needed to consider the constant term from the second polynomial. So, my calculation seems correct. The coefficient is indeed 120.\n\nAlternatively, another way to think about it is that when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from \\((a + b)^4\\) will multiply each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but only the term with \\(c^0\\) will result in a term that doesn't have any \\(c\\) in it, thus contributing to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, that's why we only needed the constant term from the second part.\n\nLet me also verify the binomial coefficients I used. For \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\), which is correct. For \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term where the exponent is 0 occurs when \\(m = 3\\), so \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\), which is correct as well.
