    "text": " So, maybe the \\(c\\) terms don't affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, let me think. When I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since I'm only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term from \\((a + b)^4\\), and the other part is multiplied by terms involving \\(c\\), which don't affect the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would just be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but wait, that doesn't make sense because when you multiply by the entire expansion, the coefficient would actually be multiplied by the sum of all terms in the second expansion. But that can't be right because the second expansion is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which when expanded, has terms involving different powers of \\(c\\). But since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), maybe the only way that happens is if we take the term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) that has \\(c^0\\), which is the constant term. Because then, when we multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by that constant term, we get a term with \\(a^2b^2\\). If we took any other term with a positive or negative power of \\(c\\), the resulting term would have \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) where \\(k\\) is some integer, but since we're only interested in \\(a^2b^2\\), the coefficient would only come from the constant term in the second expansion. So, first, let me find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(1/c\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the exponent on \\(c\\) is \\(6 - 2m\\). We want the term where the exponent is 0 because that's the constant term. So, set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which gives \\(m = 3\\). So, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} c^{0} = \\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, the constant term is 20. So, going back to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 20. Since these two are multiplied together in the product, the overall coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Let me just double-check that I didn't make a mistake. First, I found the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) correctly using the binomial coefficient, which is 6. Then, I realized that to get a term without any \\(c\\) in the product, I needed the constant term from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is when \\(m = 3\\), giving \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying these together gives 120. Yeah, that seems right. I don't think I missed anything here. So, the coefficient should be 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem.\n\nFirst, we expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n\\]\nWe are interested in the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2, which corresponds to \\(k = 2\\). The coefficient for this term is:\n\\[\n\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\n\\]\n\nNext, we consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem:\n\\[\n\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n\\]\nWe need the constant term, which occurs when the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0. Setting \\(6 - 2m = 0\\) gives \\(m = 3\\). The constant term is:\n\\[\n\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\n\\]\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficients from the two expansions:\n\\[\n6 \\times 20 = 120\n\\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

    "text": " So, maybe the terms involving \\(c\\) don't affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)? Wait, let me think. When you multiply two expressions together, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression. But since the second expression is in terms of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), and the first expression is in terms of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), the coefficients from each part will multiply together. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the coefficient of the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, is that right? Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by any term from the second expression, the exponents of \\(c\\) would affect the overall term, but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), we need to consider the terms where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out, i.e., where the power of \\(c\\) is zero. So, in other words, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) (the constant term) in the second part. So, let me check that. So, first, I have 6 as the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\). Now, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let's expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem. So, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying that, each term becomes \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m} = \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\) so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake here. So, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6. Then, in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the constant term is when \\(m = 3\\), which gives \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, when you multiply these two parts together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by 20 from the second part, giving 6 * 20 = 120. So, I think that's correct. Therefore, the coefficient is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is found by expanding each part separately and then multiplying the relevant coefficients.\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\):**\n   Using the binomial theorem, the term with \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\\).\n\n2. **Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   We look for the constant term (where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0).

Wait, no, that doesn't make sense because the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so maybe it's just the coefficient from the first part, since the second part doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. Let me think again. When you multiply two polynomials, the coefficients multiply. So, if I have \\((a + b)^4 = 6a^2b^2 + \\text{other terms}\\), and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\text{some expansion}\\), then when I multiply them, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in the second expansion. Wait, but that can't be right because the second expansion has terms with different powers of \\(c\\), so they wouldn't combine with \\(a^2b^2\\) in a way that affects the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, actually, no. When you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by any term in the second expansion, it's just \\(a^2b^2\\) times that term. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion. But wait, the second expansion is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me compute that. Using the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). Now, the sum of the coefficients in this expansion is when \\(c = 1\\), because substituting \\(c = 1\\) gives the sum of the coefficients. So, substituting \\(c = 1\\), we get \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 64 (sum of coefficients from the second part), which is 6 * 64 = 384. Wait, but that seems too straightforward. Let me check again. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and the second part is multiplied by that term, but since the second part doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), the coefficient would just be the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the entire second expansion. But that doesn't make sense because the second expansion is not a single term but a sum of terms. Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. Let me think differently. The product \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is equal to the sum over all terms of the product of terms from each expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the first expansion, and it's multiplied by every term in the second expansion. So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion multiplied by the entire second expansion. But that would mean the coefficient is 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial, not a number. But that can't be right because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. So, perhaps I'm making a mistake here. Wait, maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, in other words, it's the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by any power of \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and since it's multiplied by the entire second expansion, the coefficient is 6 times the sum of the coefficients of the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. Hmm, that seems plausible. Let me check with a simpler example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1)^1\\). The expansion of \\((a + b)^2\\) is \\(a^2 + 2ab + b^2\\). The expansion of \\((c + 1)\\) is \\(c + 1\\). So, the product is \\(a^2(c + 1) + 2ab(c + 1) + b^2(c + 1)\\). The coefficient of \\(a^2\\) would be 1 (from \\(a^2\\)) times the sum of coefficients in \\((c + 1)\\), which is 1 + 1 = 2. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) in the product is 1 * 2 = 2. Similarly, the coefficient of \\(ab\\) would be 2 * 2 = 4. So, yes, in that case, the coefficient of a specific term in the first polynomial is multiplied by the sum of coefficients in the second polynomial. So, applying that logic here, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 64, so the total coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplying it by the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 64. Thus, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{384}\n\\]"

So, perhaps I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me proceed under that assumption.\n\nSo, to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), I need to consider the expansion of both \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), and find the terms where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2 and 2 respectively, and the exponents of \\(c\\) sum to zero.\n\nFirst, from \\((a + b)^4\\), as I did earlier, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6.\n\nNext, from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\), which is the constant term.

But that would mean that the coefficient is a polynomial, which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. Therefore, I must have misinterpreted the problem. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, but that would still require considering all possible powers of \\(c\\), which isn't feasible. Alternatively, maybe the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating \\(c\\) as a constant, but that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which again is a polynomial, not a single number.

In that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 times \\(2^6 = 6*64=384\\). But that seems more complicated, and I'm not sure if that's the intended meaning.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable, so the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which would be a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, so that can't be right.\n\nTherefore, I think the correct interpretation is that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. So, I'll go with that.\n\nWait, but to make sure, let me consider an example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^1 (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, expanding, we get \\((a + b)(c + 1/c)\\). The coefficient of \\(a^1b^0\\) would be 1 times the entire expansion of \\(c + 1/c\\), which is 1*(c + 1/c). But if we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^1b^0c^0\\), that would be 1*1=1, because in the expansion, the term \\(a \\times 1/c\\) would have \\(a c^{-1}\\), which isn't \\(c^0\\). Wait, no, in that case, the term \\(a \\times c\\) would be \\(a c\\), and \\(a \\times 1/c\\) would be \\(a c^{-1}\\). Similarly, \\(b \\times c\\) and \\(b \\times 1/c\\). So, the term \\(a^1b^0c^0\\) would only come from \\(a \\times c^0\\), but \\(c^0\\) is 1, so the coefficient would be 1*1=1. Similarly, the term \\(a^1b^0c^0\\) is just \\(a\\), so the coefficient is 1. So, in that case, the coefficient of \\(a^1b^0c^0\\) is 1. So, in the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is 6*20=120.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So, I think that's the correct approach.\n\nSo, to summarize:\n\n1. Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}=6\\).\n\n2. Expand \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem. The constant term (where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0) occurs when \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), so \\(k=3\\). The coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}=20\\).\n\n3. Multiply the two coefficients together to get the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is \\(6*20=120\\).\n\nTherefore, the coefficient is 120.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we proceed as follows:\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term with \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\), so the coefficient is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\n   \\]\n\n2. **Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n   \\]\n   To find the constant term (\\(c^0\\)), set the exponent equal to zero:\n   \\[\n   6 - 2k = 0 \\implies k = 3\n   \\]\n   The coefficient is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\n   \\]\n\n3. **Multiply the coefficients from both expansions:**\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 20 = 120\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

    "text": " So, perhaps the other terms involving \\(c\\) don't affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)? Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Let me think again. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, so perhaps I need to consider that when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the \\(c\\) terms might combine in such a way that they don't affect the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. Alternatively, maybe the \\(c\\) terms are separate, and so the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be the same as in \\((a + b)^4\\), multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, no, that doesn't make sense because the product would involve all possible combinations of terms from both expansions. Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me try to write out the product. So, \\((a + b)^4\\) expands to \\(a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). And \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) would expand to, using the binomial theorem again, \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying that, each term becomes \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). Now, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion gets multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the product will have terms like \\(a^4 \\times \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\), and similarly for the other terms in \\((a + b)^4\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which comes from the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion. So, when this term is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, the resulting terms will be \\(6a^2b^2 \\times \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\) for each \\(m\\) from 0 to 6. However, the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would mean that we're considering the terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by some power of \\(c\\). But wait, in the product, each term from \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), so the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will appear in the product with coefficients from each term in the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the sum of the coefficients from each term in the second expansion multiplied by 6. Wait, no, that's not quite right. Actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is being multiplied by \\(6a^2b^2\\). But wait, that can't be right because the coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) aren't all 1; they vary depending on \\(m\\). Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Maybe the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would just be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that doesn't make sense because then the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\), not a constant. Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, the problem is asking for the coefficient of the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion of the entire product, which includes all the \\(c\\) terms. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), so the coefficient would be the sum over all the coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by 6. Wait, no, that's not correct. Let me think again. When you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum of the products of the coefficients of terms that multiply together to give that specific term. But in this case, since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will only come from multiplying \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first polynomial by each term from the second polynomial. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. But that can't be right because the coefficient would then include terms with \\(c\\). Wait, maybe the problem is considering the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, perhaps the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in the second expansion. Because each term in the second expansion is a coefficient times some power of \\(c\\), so when you multiply \\(6a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, you get terms like \\(6 \\times \\dbinom{6}{m} a^2b^2 c^{6 - 2m}\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the sum of all the coefficients from the second expansion, each multiplied by 6. So, the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). Wait, that seems high. Let me check that again. Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. The problem might just be asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, considering all possible terms, including the \\(c\\) terms. But since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), the coefficient would just be 6 times the entire expansion of the second part. But that doesn't make sense because the coefficient can't have \\(c\\) terms. Alternatively, maybe the problem is considering the coefficient in the sense of treating \\(c\\) as another variable, so the coefficient would include terms with \\(c\\). But that seems unlikely because the problem specifies the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), implying that it's a constant coefficient, not a polynomial in \\(c\\). Therefore, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when considering all terms, regardless of \\(c\\), which would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, as I thought before. So, the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is when \\(c = 1\\), which is 64. Therefore, the coefficient would be 6 * 64 = 384. But let me check that another way. Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, so the coefficient would be 6 times each coefficient from the second expansion, but that would mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense. So, I think the correct interpretation is that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when considering the entire product, but as a constant term, meaning that it's the sum of all coefficients that multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) times some power of \\(c\\). But that's a bit unclear. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which would mean that we're looking for the sum of all coefficients that come from multiplying \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion. So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. But let me think again. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which would be the product of the coefficients from each part. So, from \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. From \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) (since we want the term that doesn't affect the \\(a^2b^2\\) term's coefficient) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\), because when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), \\(m = 3\\). So, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 * 20 = 120. Wait, that makes more sense. Because if we're looking for the term where the power of \\(c\\) is zero, meaning that it's a constant term, then we only consider the term from the second expansion where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, which is when \\(m = 3\\), giving us 20. So, the coefficient would be 6 * 20 = 120. Hmm, so which is it? 120 or 384? I think I need to clarify the problem. The problem says, \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, it's asking for the coefficient of the term that has \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, that would mean that each term in the product that has \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by any power of \\(c\\) would contribute to the coefficient. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the sum of all the coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by 6. So, that would be 6 * (sum of coefficients in the second expansion). The sum of coefficients in the second expansion is when \\(c = 1\\), so \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient would be 6 * 64 = 384. But that seems high. Alternatively, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it's 6 * 20 = 120. So, I need to figure out which interpretation is correct. Let me look at the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" It doesn't specify any power of \\(c\\), so perhaps it's considering the coefficient as a polynomial in \\(c\\). So, the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of the second polynomial, which would mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(6 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because coefficients are constants. Therefore, perhaps the correct interpretation is that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when considering the entire product as a polynomial in \\(a, b, c\\). So, each term in the product is of the form \\(a^kb^{4 - k} \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would have \\(k = 2\\), so the coefficient would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\), but since \\(m\\) can vary, the coefficient is actually a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would include all the terms from the second expansion multiplied by 6. So, the coefficient would be \\(6 \\times \\left(c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15\\dfrac{1}{c^2} + 6\\dfrac{1}{c^4} + \\dfrac{1}{c^6}\\right)\\). But that seems complicated, and I don't think that's what the problem is asking. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, so the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\). But that seems unlikely because the problem didn't specify that. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which would mean that we're looking for the sum of all coefficients that come from multiplying \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion. So, that would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. But I'm not entirely sure. Let me check with a simpler example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^2 (c + 1/c)^1\\). The expansion would be \\((a^2 + 2ab + b^2)(c + 1/c)\\). The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be... Wait, in this case, there is no \\(a^2b^2\\) term because the first expansion only goes up to \\(a^2\\) and \\(b^2\\), but when multiplied by \\(c + 1/c\\), the terms become \\(a^2c\\), \\(2abc\\), \\(2ab/c\\), \\(b^2c\\), etc. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't exist in the product. Therefore, the coefficient would be zero. But if I were to compute it as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), it would still be zero because there's no \\(a^2b^2\\) term. Alternatively, if I consider the coefficient as a polynomial in \\(c\\), then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be zero because there's no such term. Therefore, perhaps in the original problem, the coefficient is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. But wait, in my simpler example, if I have \\((a + b)^2 (c + 1/c)^1\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would indeed be zero because there's no \\(a^2b^2\\) term. So, in the original problem, we have \\((a + b)^4 (c + 1/c)^6\\). The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it's 6 * 20 = 120. I think the correct interpretation is that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), which would mean that it's 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, giving 384. But I'm not entirely sure. Let me try another approach. The entire product is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\) with coefficient 6. When this term is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each of those products will have a term with \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by some power of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times \\left(c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15\\dfrac{1}{c^2} + 6\\dfrac{1}{c^4} + \\dfrac{1}{c^6}\\right)\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would be this entire expression. However, if the problem is asking for the coefficient as a constant term (i.e., the term where the power of \\(c\\) is zero), then it's 6 * 20 = 120. Alternatively, if it's asking for the coefficient regardless of \\(c\\), then it's 6 times the entire expansion, which is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But since the problem didn't specify, I think the intended answer is 120, considering only the constant term with respect to \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break down the problem as follows:\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\), so its coefficient is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\n   \\]\n\n2. **Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n   \\]\n   We are interested in the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero (i.e., the constant term), which occurs when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), so \\(m = 3\\).

So, I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). How do I find that? Well, again, using the binomial theorem. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\).

Wait, but actually, the entire expression is a product of two expansions, so when I multiply them, I have to consider how the terms combine. But since I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), perhaps the \\(c\\) terms can be treated separately or maybe they don't affect the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. Wait, let me think. When I expand \\((a + b)^4\\), I get terms like \\(a^4\\), \\(4a^3b\\), \\(6a^2b^2\\), \\(4ab^3\\), and \\(b^4\\).

Because in the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) is a standalone term. When I multiply it by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), I'll get terms like \\(6a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(6a^2b^2c^5\\), and so on, down to \\(6a^2b^2 \\times 1\\).

But wait, no, that can't be right because each term in the second expansion has different powers of \\(c\\), so when I multiply \\(6a^2b^2\\) by each term, the resulting terms will have different powers of \\(c\\), but the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) specifically would only be present in the term where the second factor is 1, because that's the only term that doesn't add any powers of \\(c\\).

Using the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the constant term occurs when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which is when \\(m = 3\\). So, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, when I multiply \\(6a^2b^2\\) by 20, I get \\(120a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 120. Wait, that makes more sense. So, I think I made a mistake earlier by not considering that the second expansion's constant term affects the coefficient. So, the correct approach is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiply it by the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20, giving 120. Let me verify this again. So, \\((a + b)^4\\) gives \\(6a^2b^2\\), and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) gives a constant term of 20. Therefore, when multiplied together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by 20, so the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120. Yeah, that seems right. So, the final answer should be 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6. Then, we find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20. Multiplying these together gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{120}"

    "text": " So, maybe the other part doesn't affect the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\). Let me think. When I multiply two expressions together, each term in the first expression multiplies each term in the second expression. But since I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and the second part doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), perhaps I can consider that when I multiply the terms, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part will multiply each term from the second part. But since I'm only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and the second part doesn't have any \\(a\\) or \\(b\\) terms, then the coefficient from the second part will just be 1, because when you multiply by 1, it doesn't change the coefficient. Wait, is that right? Let me check. So, the first part gives me 6 as the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\), and the second part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of what happens with \\(c\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will just get multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. But since the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and not any specific term involving \\(c\\), I think the coefficient is just 6 times whatever the coefficient is in the second part when it's multiplied by 1. Wait, that might not make sense. Alternatively, maybe the second part's expansion doesn't affect the \\(a^2b^2\\) term at all because it's only in terms of \\(c\\). So, perhaps the coefficient remains 6. But that seems too simple. Let me think again. The problem is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, when I expand this, each term from the first expansion is multiplied by each term from the second expansion. So, for example, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part would be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which would give terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) where \\(k\\) varies. But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would imply that we're looking for terms where the powers of \\(c\\) cancel out, or perhaps that the term is \\(a^2b^2\\) times some constant, but I'm not sure. Wait, actually, no. The problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). But that can't be right because the entire expression would have terms involving both \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\). So, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Perhaps it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, considering all possible powers of \\(c\\). But that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which would give a coefficient of \\(6 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't make sense because the coefficient is a number, not an expression involving \\(c\\). So, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Let me try another approach. Since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and the other part of the expression is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), then when I multiply, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second part. But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, I think that the coefficient is just 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but that can't be right because the coefficient should be a number, not a polynomial. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, considering all possible terms. But that would mean that the coefficient is 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which would give a coefficient that's a polynomial in \\(c\\). But that seems odd because the problem is phrased as \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", which usually refers to a numerical coefficient. Wait, perhaps I'm misinterpreting the problem. Maybe it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, but since the other part is in terms of \\(c\\), maybe the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would be 6 times \\(2^6\\) because each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) has coefficients that are either 1 or something else. Wait, no, that's not right. The sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) would be found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of the coefficients is 64. But I'm not sure if that's what's being asked here. Alternatively, maybe the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, not a number. So, perhaps the problem is miswritten, or I'm misunderstanding it. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating \\(c\\) as a variable, which would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that seems odd. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, considering that the second part doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms, so the coefficient remains 6. But that seems too simplistic. Let me try to clarify: the expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). When I expand this, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part, which would give terms like \\(6a^2b^2c^k\\) where \\(k\\) varies. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients of all the terms in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but that's not quite right because each term is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), so the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^k\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would include all the terms where the exponent of \\(a\\) is 2 and \\(b\\) is 2, regardless of the exponent of \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but that can't be right because the coefficient should be a number. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, but considering only the terms where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out, i.e., where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. That is, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). That makes more sense. So, perhaps I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) and then multiply it by 6. Let me try that approach. So, first, I found that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. Now, I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). The constant term is the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. Using the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(1/c\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We want the exponent of \\(c\\) to be zero, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 times 20, which is 120. So, the final answer should be 120. Let me just double-check my steps. First, I expanded \\((a + b)^4\\) and found the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) to be 6. Then, I considered the second part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), and found the constant term, which is 20. Multiplying these together gives 6 * 20 = 120. That seems correct. I don't think I made any mistakes in the calculations. So, I'm confident that the coefficient is 120.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we proceed as follows:\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term with \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\):\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\n   \\]\n   So, the coefficient is 6.\n\n2. **Find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n   \\]\n   The constant term occurs when the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0:\n   \\[\n   6 - 2k = 0 \\implies k = 3\n   \\]\n   The constant term is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\n   \\]\n\n3. **Multiply the coefficients:**\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is:\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 20 = 120\n   \\]\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\\[\n\\boxed{120}\n\\]"

    "text": " So, does that mean I don't need to consider the \\(c\\) terms when looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)? Hmm, let me think. Wait, no, because when you multiply two expressions, each term in the first expression is multiplied by each term in the second expression. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) don't appear in the second part \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), maybe the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just the same as in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).

Wait, no, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), maybe the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are independent of the terms involving \\(c\\). So, when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which only involves \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), the coefficient would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all terms in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that can't be right because the sum of all terms in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is a polynomial in \\(c\\), and when you multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), it would result in a term that's \\(a^2b^2\\) times a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). Wait, no, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Let me check the problem again: it says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)\". So, I think it's asking for the coefficient of the term \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by any term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean that the coefficient is the same as in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which would be a sum of terms. But that doesn't make sense because the coefficient would then be a sum of coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, no, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Maybe the question is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable, so the coefficient would be the same as in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), meaning that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems a bit off because the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) would be when \\(c = 1\\), which is \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 * 64 = 384. But wait, that seems too high. Let me think again. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would indeed be 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384. But let me confirm that. Wait, let me think differently. When you have two separate variables, \\(a, b\\) and \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, in other words, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Since the sum of coefficients in a polynomial is found by setting all variables to 1, so here, setting \\(c = 1\\), we get \\(\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the coefficient would be 6 * 64 = 384. But wait, let me check if that's correct. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), meaning the term where \\(c\\) cancels out, i.e., the constant term. So, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me try to approach this differently. Let me first expand \\((a + b)^4\\) and find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is 6 as I found earlier. Now, the second part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me expand that using the binomial theorem as well. So, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). Now, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) times each power of \\(c\\) would be 6 times each coefficient in the second expansion. So, the total coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. The sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by substituting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, 6 times 64 is 384. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 384. Wait, but let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), which would indeed be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, if the problem had specified a particular power of \\(c\\), say \\(c^0\\), then we would have to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) and multiply it by 6. But since it's just asking for \\(a^2b^2\\), without any restriction on \\(c\\), I think the answer is 384. Wait, but let me check again. Let me think about how the multiplication works. So, \\((a + b)^4\\) is a polynomial in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is a Laurent polynomial in \\(c\\). When you multiply them, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is indeed 6 * 64 = 384. So, I think that's the correct approach. Therefore, the coefficient is 384.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break down the problem as follows:\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\), so its coefficient is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\n   \\]\n\n2. **Consider the second part \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   The entire expansion of this term will be multiplied by each term in \\((a + b)^4\\).

Wait, no, that might not be correct. Let me think again. Actually, when you multiply two expressions, each term in the first expression is multiplied by each term in the second expression. So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term in the first part, then in the second part, I need to consider the term that doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\). Because if I multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by a term involving \\(c\\), I would get a term like \\(a^2b^2c\\) or \\(a^2b^2/c\\), but not just \\(a^2b^2\\). So, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because that's the term that would multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) to give \\(a^2b^2\\). So, let me find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Again, using the binomial theorem, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying that, it's \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m - m} = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be 0, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\).

    "text": " So, does that mean that the terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) don't affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)? Hmm, maybe. Because when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), perhaps we can treat \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) as a constant with respect to \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). Wait, that might not be accurate. Let me think again. When you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by every term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), it seems like we just need to find how many times \\(a^2b^2\\) appears when multiplied by all the terms from the other expansion. But wait, no, actually, when you multiply two expressions, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by every term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that doesn't make sense because the entire expansion would add more terms. Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), the terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) don't affect the powers of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). So, when you multiply, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, no, that's not right. Because when you multiply, each term is a product of terms from each expansion. So, for example, \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), so the coefficient would be 6 times each coefficient in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that can't be right because the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) would be when \\(c = 1\\), so substituting \\(c = 1\\), \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). So, the coefficient would be 6 * 64 = 384? Hmm, that seems high. Let me check. Alternatively, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question. Maybe it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the powers of \\(c\\), meaning that in the entire expansion, how many times does \\(a^2b^2\\) appear multiplied by any power of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384. But let me think again. Alternatively, perhaps the question is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which would be the product of the coefficients from each part. So, since in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, and in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the entire expression is a sum of terms, but when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), each term in the second expansion would just scale the \\(a^2b^2\\) term by that coefficient. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, as I thought earlier, 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me try a different approach. Let's consider the entire product: \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). We can expand each part separately and then look for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, first, \\((a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) here is 6. Now, the other part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let's expand that using the binomial theorem as well. So, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). Now, when we multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) with coefficient 6 in the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). So, 6 * 64 = 384. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 384. But let me double-check to make sure I'm not making a mistake. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, considering all possible terms. So, each term in the product is of the form (coefficient from first expansion) * (coefficient from second expansion) * a^2b^2 * c^{something}. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by the coefficient 6 from the first expansion. So, yes, that would be 6 * (sum of coefficients in second expansion) = 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, perhaps I'm misinterpreting the problem. Maybe it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, considering that \\(c\\) is another variable. So, perhaps the coefficient would be 6 times each term from the second expansion, but since \\(c\\) is separate, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\) would indeed be 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64. So, 6 * 64 = 384. Hmm, that seems correct. Let me try another approach to confirm. Let's consider that when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each polynomial. But in this case, \\((a + b)^4\\) only has terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), while \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) only has terms involving \\(c\\). Therefore, when you multiply them, the coefficients of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. So, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. Since the sum of coefficients in the second expansion is 64, the coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384. Therefore, the final answer should be 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\(2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n\\boxed{384}"

The entire expression is the product of two binomial expansions. So, when I multiply them, each term in the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. However, since I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which comes from \\((a + b)^4\\), and doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), maybe the second part doesn't affect it? Wait, no, that doesn't make sense because when you multiply two expressions, each term from the first is multiplied by each term from the second. But if I'm looking for a term that only has \\(a^2b^2\\), then the other part must be a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\). Because if it does, then the term would have \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or something, which is not what we want. So, we need to find the term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) that is a constant term, i.e., the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. Because then, when we multiply that term by \\(a^2b^2\\), we get \\(a^2b^2\\) times that constant, which is what we're interested in. So, first, let me find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Again, I can use the binomial theorem for this. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying that, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m} = \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be zero for the term to be constant. So, set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which gives \\(m = 3\\). So, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\), which is \\(\\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20. Therefore, when I multiply the two expansions, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion is multiplied by the constant term 20 from the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Wait, let me double-check. So, the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the constant term from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 20. So, when you multiply these together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by 20, so the coefficient becomes 6 * 20 = 120. Hmm, that seems right. I don't think I made a mistake there. So, the coefficient is 120.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we first determine the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem. This coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Next, we find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which occurs when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. This term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying these results together gives the coefficient as \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

Wait, no, that can't be right. Because when you multiply two expressions, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, for example, if I have \\((a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^4 \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^6 \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^6 \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\).

Now, since the second part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a separate expansion, but when we're multiplying, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second. But since we're looking for \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually be the coefficient from the first part, multiplied by the entire sum of the second part, because every term in the second part is multiplied by the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. Wait, no, that doesn't make sense because when you multiply, you have to consider how each term interacts. Wait, no, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think again. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When expanded, it's the product of two separate polynomials.

But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), then any term in the second expansion would just contribute a factor that is multiplied by the coefficient from the first part. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, that can't be right because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, not an expression. So, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Wait, let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, perhaps I'm supposed to consider that when you multiply the two expressions, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term is multiplied by every term in the second expansion, so the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. But that doesn't make sense because the second expansion is in terms of \\(c\\), and the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Perhaps the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating \\(c\\) as another variable. So, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all terms in the second expansion, but that would make the coefficient a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. Maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, meaning that the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, not a single number. That doesn't make sense. So, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable, so the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which would be 6 multiplied by each term in the second expansion.

Wait, that might be the case. Let me think again. When you have two separate polynomials multiplied together, like \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the product is a polynomial where each term is a product of a term from the first polynomial and a term from the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would come from the first polynomial, and it would be multiplied by every term from the second polynomial. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial multiplied by the entire second polynomial. But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. So, perhaps I'm misinterpreting the problem. Maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some \\(k\\), but it's not. It's just asking for \\(a^2b^2\\), so perhaps the answer is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that seems odd. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to have the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) as a constant, which would mean that the second expansion must not affect it, but that doesn't make sense because the second expansion is part of the product. Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me try a different approach. Let's consider that \\((a + b)^4\\) has the term \\(a^2b^2\\) with coefficient 6, as we found. The other part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), when expanded, will have terms like \\(c^6, c^4, c^2, 1, c^{-2}, c^{-4}, c^{-6}\\). So, when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. So, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable, meaning that the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which would be \\(6 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems odd because the problem is likely expecting a numerical coefficient, not a polynomial. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to have the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) as a constant, which would mean that the second expansion must not affect it, but that doesn't make sense because the second expansion is part of the product. Wait, maybe I'm missing something. Let me think again. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. So, when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each polynomial. But in this case, \\(a^2b^2\\) is only present in the first polynomial, \\((a + b)^4\\), and not in the second, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial. Wait, no, that's not correct. When you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial multiplied by the entire second polynomial. But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, which doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only considering the terms where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out, meaning that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). That might make sense because then the coefficient would be a number. Let me check that. So, if I consider that, then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, first, let me find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^6 \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^6 \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, we need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0. So, \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which implies \\(m = 3\\). So, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times 20, which is 120. So, the answer is 120. Wait, that seems plausible. Let me recap to make sure I didn't make a mistake. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Therefore, when you multiply the two expressions, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by the constant term (i.e., \\(c^0\\)) from the second expansion, resulting in a coefficient of 6 * 20 = 120. That makes sense because the other terms in the second expansion would involve positive or negative exponents of \\(c\\), which wouldn't contribute to the \\(a^2b^2\\) term if we're only considering the coefficient as a numerical value, not a polynomial. So, I think that's the correct approach. Therefore, the coefficient is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplying it by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20. Therefore, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\boxed{120}"

Now, in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\), because when I multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), the term \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) will be the one I'm interested in. So, how do I find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)? Again, using the binomial theorem: \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, we need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be 0, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Now, since the entire expression is the product of \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) would be the product of the coefficients from each part. So, 6 (from \\(a^2b^2\\)) multiplied by 20 (from \\(c^0\\)) gives 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120. Wait, but let me double-check that. So, in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) has a coefficient of 6. In the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term where \\(c^0\\) is when \\(m = 3\\), which gives a coefficient of 20. So, when we multiply these two expansions together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by every term from the second part. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and the second part doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will indeed be 6 multiplied by 20, which is 120. So, I think that's the correct answer. I don't think I made any mistakes here, but let me just recap to be sure. The problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product of two expansions. The first expansion, \\((a + b)^4\\), gives a coefficient of 6 for \\(a^2b^2\\). The second expansion, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), when expanded, has a term where \\(c^0\\) with coefficient 20. Since these two expansions are multiplied together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is 6 * 20 = 120. So, the answer should be 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Multiplying these gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\boxed{120}"

    "text": " So, I think the terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) won't affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Let me think. When I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the expansion will be a product of a term from \\((a + b)^4\\) and a term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since the problem is only concerned with the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I don't need to worry about the \\(c\\) terms. The coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) will just be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but since the question is only about the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I can treat the other part as a constant multiplier. Wait, no, that's not quite right. Actually, when you multiply two polynomials, each term in one is multiplied by each term in the other. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term in the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) variables, the \\(c\\) terms would just contribute a factor that doesn't affect the \\(a^2b^2\\) term's coefficient. Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me clarify. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from \\((a + b)^4\\), and when we multiply by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), that means we're looking for the product of the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from \\((a + b)^4\\) and the constant term (the term with \\(c^0\\)) from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because any term involving \\(c\\) would result in a term that includes \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), which wouldn't be part of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, to find the coefficient, I need to compute two things: 1. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which I already found as 6. 2. The constant term (the term with \\(c^0\\)) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Then, multiply these two results together to get the final coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression. So, let me work on finding the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Again, I can use the binomial theorem here. The expansion is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k\\). Simplifying the exponents: \\(c^{6 - k} \\times c^{-k} = c^{6 - 2k}\\). We want the term where the exponent is 0, so set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\): \\(6 - 2k = 0\\) => \\(2k = 6\\) => \\(k = 3\\). So, the constant term is when \\(k = 3\\). The coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20. Now, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Therefore, when we multiply the two expressions, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) will be 6 multiplied by 20, which is 120. Wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake here. So, \\((a + b)^4\\) has a term \\(6a^2b^2\\), and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) has a term \\(20c^0\\), which is just 20. So, when you multiply them, \\(6a^2b^2 \\times 20 = 120a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient is indeed 120. I think that makes sense. Let me just recap to make sure I didn't skip any steps. First, I found the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which was 6. Then, I found the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which was 20. Multiplying these together gives 120, which is the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations. So, I think the answer is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is found using the binomial coefficient \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). The constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying these gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\boxed{120}."

    "text": " So, maybe I don't need to consider the terms from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) when looking for \\(a^2b^2\\), because \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\). Let me think about that. If I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), then I'm only concerned with the terms that come from \\((a + b)^4\\), right? Because the other part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), so when multiplied, any term from that part would multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), but since we're just looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, maybe the coefficient is just 6 times whatever the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, because if I have \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by \\(c^k\\) and \\(c^{-k}\\), but since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, maybe the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't seem right because each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) would contribute to different powers of \\(c\\). Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Maybe the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just 6, because when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the \\(a^2b^2\\) term is just 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, that would mean the coefficient is 6 multiplied by the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But the sum of the coefficients in a binomial expansion is found by setting the variable to 1. So, if I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 64. So, then, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 * 64 = 384. Wait, but that seems too high. Let me check that again. Alternatively, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, it's a product of two expressions, one in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the other in \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, when you multiply them, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But when looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), you only consider the terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any term from the second expansion. So, the coefficient would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part, because \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), so any term from the second expansion will just multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) without affecting the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384. But let me confirm this by another approach. Alternatively, maybe I can think of the entire expression as a product, and the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because the \\(c\\) terms don't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. So, indeed, the coefficient would be 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it, and the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and that's it, regardless of the other terms. But that can't be right because the problem includes the other part. Wait, maybe the problem is that \\(a^2b^2\\) is present in \\((a + b)^4\\), and when you multiply by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), you're just adding more terms, but \\(a^2b^2\\) remains as a term multiplied by any combination of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is a coefficient times \\(c^k\\), and when you multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), you get \\(a^2b^2\\) times that coefficient times \\(c^k\\). So, if you want the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), it's 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The sum of coefficients is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), so \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, 6 * 64 = 384. So, the coefficient is 384. Wait, but I'm a bit confused because sometimes when you have multiple variables, the coefficients can interfere. But in this case, since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), their exponents don't affect each other. So, I think 384 is correct. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, meaning that it's 6 times the expansion of the second part, but maybe I need to consider that the second part could have terms that affect the coefficient. Wait, no, because \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), so their coefficients are independent. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion. So, 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, maybe the problem is simpler. Let me think again. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). When you expand this, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, which are various powers of \\(c\\). So, in the product, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part (which is 6) multiplied by each coefficient from the second part. But wait, that would mean the coefficient is 6 times each coefficient from the second expansion, but since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), we need to sum all those contributions. So, the total coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. The sum of coefficients in the second expansion is when \\(c = 1\\), which is \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the total coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384. So, I think that's the answer. But let me check again. Alternatively, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, without considering the \\(c\\) terms. So, perhaps it's just 6, because the \\(c\\) terms don't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. But that doesn't seem right because when you multiply, each term from the first expansion is multiplied by each term from the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, so the coefficient would be 6 times each coefficient from the second expansion. But since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), we need to add up all those contributions, which is 6 times the sum of coefficients in the second expansion. So, 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, maybe I should think of it as the product of the two expansions. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, because each term in the second expansion contributes a coefficient that multiplies \\(a^2b^2\\). So, yeah, that would be 6 * 64 = 384. I think that's correct. So, the coefficient is 384.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. Let me think differently. Suppose I consider the entire expression as \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). When I expand this, each term will be of the form \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}a^{4 - k}b^k \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - m}(1/c)^m\\). Simplifying the second part: \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the term would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}\\dbinom{6}{m}a^{4 - k}b^k c^{6 - 2m}\\). Now, I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, I need \\(4 - k = 2\\), which implies \\(k = 2\\), and \\(b^k = b^2\\), so that's correct. So, the coefficient from the first part is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Now, for each \\(m\\) from 0 to 6, the second part contributes \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 multiplied by the sum over \\(m\\) from 0 to 6 of \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\). Because each term in the second expansion is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\), and when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), the coefficient is 6 * \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\). So, the total coefficient is 6 * sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} = 6 * 2^6 = 6 * 64 = 384. So, yes, that confirms it. The coefficient is 384.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of it as the product of the two expansions, and the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the product of the coefficients of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and the sum of coefficients in the second part. So, 6 * 64 = 384. Yeah, that seems right.\n\nWait, but let me check if I'm not overcomplicating. Let me think of a simpler case. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, expanding, we have \\((a^2 + 2ab + b^2) \\times (c + 1/c)\\). The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be zero because in the first expansion, \\(a^2b^2\\) isn't present. Wait, but that's not helpful. Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me take another example: \\((a + b)^1 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, expanding, we have \\((a + b)(c + 1/c)\\). The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is zero because \\(a^2b^2\\) isn't present. So, in that case, the coefficient is zero. But in our problem, the first part is \\((a + b)^4\\), which does have an \\(a^2b^2\\) term. So, when multiplied by the second part, each term in the second part will multiply \\(a^2b^2\\), so the coefficient will be 6 times the sum of coefficients in the second part. So, 6 * 64 = 384. I think that's correct.\n\nWait, but let me think again. The problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. So, in the product, each term is a product of a term from \\((a + b)^4\\) and a term from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term from the second part, which are \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, each such term will contribute \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\dbinom{6}{m}a^2b^2c^{6 - 2m}\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} \\times \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m}\\). Since \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} = 2^6 = 64\\), the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). So, yes, that's correct.\n\nWait, but another way to think about it is that when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in one polynomial is multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the other polynomial. So, in this case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 64, so the total coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384. That makes sense.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use generating functions. The generating function for \\((a + b)^4\\) is a polynomial where the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. The generating function for \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is another polynomial, and when you multiply them, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second generating function, which is 64. So, 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. Let me think about the multiplication. Each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial, which are various powers of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient from the first polynomial times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial because each term in the second polynomial contributes a coefficient that multiplies \\(a^2b^2\\). So, yes, that would be 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of it as the product of the two polynomials. The first polynomial has a term \\(6a^2b^2\\), and the second polynomial has terms like \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, when you multiply \\(6a^2b^2\\) by each of these terms, you get \\(6\\dbinom{6}{m}a^2b^2c^{6 - 2m}\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is \\(6 \\times \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m}\\). Since \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} = 2^6 = 64\\), the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\nWait, but let me check if that's correct by considering a simpler case. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, \\((a^2 + 2ab + b^2)(c + 1/c)\\). The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be zero because \\(a^2b^2\\) isn't present. So, in that case, the coefficient is zero, which makes sense because the first polynomial doesn't have an \\(a^2b^2\\) term. But in our problem, the first polynomial does have an \\(a^2b^2\\) term, so the coefficient would be non-zero.\n\nWait, but in our problem, the first polynomial is \\((a + b)^4\\), which does have an \\(a^2b^2\\) term with coefficient 6, and the second polynomial is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which when expanded has various terms with coefficients. So, when we multiply, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first polynomial is multiplied by each term from the second polynomial, so the coefficient becomes 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial. Since the sum of coefficients in the second polynomial is 64, the total coefficient is 384.\n\nWait, but let me think about the exponents of \\(c\\). When I multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by \\(c^k\\), it becomes \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), but the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient would be the sum of all contributions to \\(a^2b^2\\) from each term in the second polynomial. So, that's 6 times each coefficient in the second polynomial, summed together, which is 6 times the sum of coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of it as the product of two generating functions. The first generating function is \\((a + b)^4\\), and the second is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first function multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second function, because each term in the second function contributes a coefficient that multiplies \\(a^2b^2\\). So, 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Let me try a different approach. Let me consider that when you have two polynomials multiplied together, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum of the products of the coefficients of terms whose variables multiply to give that specific term. In this case, the specific term is \\(a^2b^2\\). So, in the first polynomial, \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. In the second polynomial, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), every term is of the form \\(c^k\\) or \\(c^{-k}\\), but since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), any term in the second polynomial will just multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by a coefficient, without affecting the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) exponents. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial. The sum of coefficients in the second polynomial is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. Let me think about the variables involved. The first polynomial is in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the second is in \\(c\\). So, when you multiply them, the variables are separate. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial multiplied by the entire second polynomial. But actually, that's not quite accurate because when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second, but the variables are separate. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial. Because each term in the second polynomial contributes a coefficient that multiplies \\(a^2b^2\\). So, yes, that would be 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of the problem as finding the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and then considering that this term is multiplied by every term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me check if this approach is correct. Let me take a simpler example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^1 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, expanding, we get \\((a + b)(c + 1/c)\\). The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is zero because \\(a^2b^2\\) isn't present. So, in that case, the coefficient is zero, which makes sense. But in our problem, the first polynomial has an \\(a^2b^2\\) term, so the coefficient would be non-zero.\n\nAlternatively, let's take another example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^2\\). Then, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is \\(\\dbinom{2}{1} = 2\\), and the sum of coefficients in the second part is \\((1 + 1)^2 = 4\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 2 * 4 = 8. Let me check by expanding. The product is \\((a^2 + 2ab + b^2)(c^2 + 2 + 1/c^2)\\). The term \\(2ab\\) would be multiplied by each term in the second polynomial, so \\(2ab \\times c^2\\), \\(2ab \\times 2\\), \\(2ab \\times 1/c^2\\). Similarly, \\(a^2\\) and \\(b^2\\) would be multiplied, but we're looking for \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, but in this product, \\(a^2b^2\\) isn't present because you can't get \\(a^2b^2\\) by multiplying terms from the first and second polynomials. Wait, that contradicts my earlier approach. So, perhaps my approach is wrong.\n\nWait, that's a problem. In this example, \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^2\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) should be zero because you can't get \\(a^2b^2\\) by multiplying terms from the two polynomials. But according to my earlier approach, it would be 2 * 4 = 8, which is incorrect. So, that means my approach is wrong. Therefore, I must have made a mistake.\n\nWait, so that means my earlier conclusion that the coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384 is wrong. So, I need to figure out where I went wrong.\n\nWait, in the example I just considered, \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^2\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is zero because you can't get \\(a^2b^2\\) by multiplying terms from the two polynomials. But according to my earlier approach, I would have said it's 2 * 4 = 8, which is wrong. So, that means my approach is incorrect.\n\nTherefore, I need to rethink this.\n\nWait, so perhaps I was wrong in assuming that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial and the sum of coefficients in the second polynomial. That can't be right because in the example, it gave an incorrect result.\n\nSo, perhaps the correct approach is different.\n\nWait, let me think again. When you have two polynomials multiplied together, the coefficient of a term like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) would be the product of the coefficients from each polynomial for the respective terms that multiply to give that term. But in our problem, we're only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, that would mean we need to sum over all possible \\(k\\) the product of the coefficients of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial and the coefficients of \\(c^k\\) in the second polynomial. But since the first polynomial doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial is 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^k\\) in the second polynomial is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\) where \\(k = 6 - 2m\\). So, to get the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of \\(c^k\\), we need to sum over all \\(m\\) from 0 to 6 the product 6 * \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\). Therefore, the total coefficient is 6 * sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} = 6 * 2^6 = 6 * 64 = 384. But in my earlier example, that approach gave an incorrect result. So, perhaps the problem is that in the example, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) isn't present in the product, but according to the approach, it would give a non-zero coefficient, which is wrong.\n\nWait, so perhaps the mistake is that in the example, the first polynomial is \\((a + b)^2\\), which doesn't have an \\(a^2b^2\\) term, so the coefficient should be zero. But according to the approach, it would be 2 * 4 = 8, which is wrong. So, that suggests that the approach is incorrect.\n\nWait, so perhaps the correct approach is that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second polynomial. Because \\(c^0\\) is the only term that doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. So, in the example, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\((c + 1/c)^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{2}{1} = 2\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 2 * 2 = 4. But in reality, in the product \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^2\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) isn't present because you can't get \\(a^2b^2\\) by multiplying terms from the two polynomials. So, that approach also gives an incorrect result.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me clarify: When you have a product of two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum of the products of the coefficients of terms from each polynomial that multiply together to give that specific term. So, for example, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) in the product is the sum over all possible ways to write \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) as a product of terms from each polynomial.\n\nBut in our problem, we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, that would mean we need to consider all terms in the product where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2, and the exponent of \\(c\\) can be anything. So, in other words, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the sum over all possible \\(k\\) of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) in the product.\n\nBut in the product, each term is of the form \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}a^{4 - k}b^k \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, to get \\(a^2b^2\\), we need \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\), so that's fixed. Then, the exponent of \\(c\\) would be \\(6 - 2m\\), but since we're considering all possible \\(m\\), the exponent of \\(c\\) can vary. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the sum over all \\(m\\) of \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\dbinom{6}{m}\\), which is 6 times the sum over all \\(m\\) of \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384. But in the earlier example, that approach gave a wrong result, so perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nWait, in the example where \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^2\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) should be zero because you can't get \\(a^2b^2\\) by multiplying terms from the two polynomials. But according to the approach, it's 2 * 4 = 8, which is wrong. So, that suggests that the approach is incorrect.\n\nWait, perhaps the mistake is that in the example, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't exist in the product because you can't get both \\(a^2\\) and \\(b^2\\) from \\((a + b)^2\\) without also involving \\(c\\) terms, which would require the second polynomial to contribute a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), but in reality, the second polynomial can only contribute terms involving \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), so the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) is if the second polynomial contributes a constant term, i.e., \\(c^0\\). So, in that case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second polynomial.\n\nIn the example, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\((c + 1/c)^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{2}{1} = 2\\), and the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^2\\) is zero because \\((a + b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2\\), which doesn't have an \\(a^2b^2\\) term. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be zero, which is correct. So, in that case, the approach would be to take the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second polynomial. Therefore, in our original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\).\n\nSo, let's recast the problem. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second polynomial.\n\nSo, in our problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is the middle term when \\(m = 3\\), because \\(6 - 2m = 0\\) implies \\(m = 3\\). So, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, that's different from my earlier conclusion of 384. So, which one is correct?\n\nWait, let me check with the example. In the example, \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^2\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is zero, which is correct because there's no \\(a^2b^2\\) term. So, according to this new approach, the coefficient is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second polynomial. In the example, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial is zero, so the product is zero, which is correct.\n\nIn our original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial is 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second polynomial is 20, so the product is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nBut earlier, I thought it was 384, which was based on the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial, but that approach gave an incorrect result in the example, so that approach must be wrong.\n\nTherefore, the correct approach is to take the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second polynomial, which gives 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but let me think again. When you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the sum over all possible products of coefficients from each polynomial where the variables multiply to give \\(a^2b^2\\). But since the second polynomial only involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), which are separate from \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) is if the second polynomial contributes a term with \\(c^0\\), because any other term would introduce a \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\) factor, which would make the term \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) instead of \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second polynomial.\n\nSo, in our problem, that's 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, that makes sense. So, in the example, \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^2\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is zero because the first polynomial doesn't have an \\(a^2b^2\\) term, regardless of the second polynomial.\n\nIn our original problem, the first polynomial has an \\(a^2b^2\\) term with coefficient 6, and the second polynomial has a \\(c^0\\) term with coefficient"

    "text": " So, perhaps the terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) don't affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, let me think. When I multiply two expressions, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part would get multiplied by each term in the second part, which is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), maybe I don't need to worry about the \\(c\\) terms because they won't affect the \\(a^2b^2\\) term's coefficient. Wait, that doesn't make sense because when you multiply, each term in the first expression is multiplied by each term in the second, so the \\(a^2b^2\\) term would actually be multiplied by every term in the second expression, but the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not any specific term involving \\(c\\). Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, maybe I just need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and then multiply it by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), perhaps it's just 6 times the entire expansion, but that doesn't seem right because the problem is likely expecting a numerical coefficient. Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Let me think again. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when you expand this, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would imply that regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just 6, because the other terms involve \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) and would create terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2 \\times 1/c^k\\), but not just \\(a^2b^2\\) by itself unless \\(k = 0\\). Wait, so maybe I need to consider whether there's a term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) that is a constant term (i.e., where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero), because that would be the only term that when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\) would give a pure \\(a^2b^2\\) term. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me calculate that. Using the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We want the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), \\(6 = 2m\\) so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 (from \\((a + b)^4\\)) multiplied by 20 (from the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)), which is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Wait, so that means the coefficient is 120? Let me double-check. So, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. In \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the constant term is 20. So, when you multiply these two parts together, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term gets multiplied by 20, giving 6 * 20 = 120 as the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\). That seems right. Alternatively, if I didn't consider the constant term, I might have thought the coefficient was just 6, but that's not considering the multiplication by the entire second expression. Wait, but actually, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, in the product, each term from \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part will be multiplied by every term in the second part, but the only term that doesn't introduce any \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\) is the constant term. So, only when \\(m = 3\\) in the second expansion do we get a term that's just a constant, so \\(a^2b^2\\) times that constant would give a term that's \\(a^2b^2\\) times 20, so the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120. That makes sense. So, I think the answer is 120. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't miss anything. Alternatively, maybe the problem is expecting the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some \\(k\\), but the problem just says \\(a^2b^2\\), so I think it's only considering the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms, regardless of \\(c\\). But in reality, in the product, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term is multiplied by all terms from the second expansion, so unless the second expansion has a constant term, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term would have coefficients multiplied by different powers of \\(c\\). But the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would only be present if there's a constant term in the second expansion. So, yes, 120 is the correct coefficient. So, I think I'm confident that the coefficient is 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break down the problem into two parts using the binomial theorem.\n\n1. **Expanding \\((a + b)^4\\):**\n   Using the binomial theorem, we have:\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\), so the coefficient is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\n   \\]\n\n2. **Expanding \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   Using the binomial theorem, we have:\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n   \\]\n   We need the constant term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, meaning the product, so we need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and then, since \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is multiplied by it, the coefficient would just be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try to clarify: The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When you expand this, each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).

But the problem is asking for the coefficient, which would include all those terms, so the coefficient is 6 multiplied by the expansion, meaning the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem might be asking for the coefficient in the sense of the entire product, so perhaps it's 6 times the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems too broad. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, without considering the \\(c\\) terms, meaning that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 64, as I thought earlier. So, 6 times 64 is 384. But I'm not entirely sure if that's the correct approach. Let me try to approach it differently. Maybe the problem is considering the entire expansion, and it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then, since it's multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the coefficient remains 6, but that seems incorrect because when you multiply by another expression, the coefficients get multiplied. Wait, no, because in the product, each term from \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a sum of terms with different powers of \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so maybe it's 6 times the sum of the coefficients of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 64, so 6 times 64 is 384. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, without considering the \\(c\\) terms, so the coefficient is 6. But that doesn't seem right because the entire expression is a product of two expressions, so the coefficients would be multiplied. Wait, no, because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would involve terms from both expressions, but since \\(c\\) is another variable, the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems too involved, and the problem probably expects a numerical coefficient. Maybe I should think differently. Let me consider that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which would involve only the terms where \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are squared, and \\(c\\) can be any power. So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and the rest is separate. But that seems unlikely because the entire expression is a product. Wait, perhaps I should consider that when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each polynomial. But in this case, \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) are separate, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. I'm getting confused here. Let me try to think of it another way. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. Now, when I multiply this by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) gets multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), resulting in terms like \\(6a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(6a^2b^2c^4\\), etc., up to \\(6a^2b^2c^{-6}\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a sum of terms with different powers of \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so perhaps it's 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The sum of coefficients in a polynomial is found by setting all variables to 1. So, if I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = (2)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 64. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 * 64 = 384. Therefore, the answer is 384.\n\nWait, but let me double-check that. If I have \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), and I want the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then yes, it would be 6 times the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. That seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, including all powers of \\(c\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a sum of terms, each multiplied by a power of \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a coefficient, which is a number. Therefore, the only way to interpret it is that the problem wants the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, considering all possible powers of \\(c\\), which would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. Therefore, the correct interpretation must be that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, so the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a sum of terms with different powers of \\(c\\). But since the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, perhaps it's only considering the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and the rest is part of the other variables. But that doesn't seem right because the entire expression is a product, so the coefficients should be multiplied. Wait, no, because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would involve all terms from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that's a polynomial, not a number. Therefore, perhaps the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and the rest is separate. But that seems unlikely because the entire expression is a product. I'm getting stuck here, so maybe I should look for another approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms.

But that's a polynomial, not a number. Therefore, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and that's it. But that seems too simple, and I think the problem is more likely expecting me to consider the entire product, so I should go with the earlier conclusion that the coefficient is 6 times 64, which is 384.\n\nWait, but let me think again. If I have \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), and I want the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), then in the product, each term is of the form \\((a^kb^{4 - k}) \\times (c^m c^{-(6 - m)})\\), but that's not quite right. Wait, no, in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{n}c^{6 - n} \\times \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^n = \\dbinom{6}{n}c^{6 - 2n}\\). So, each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{n}c^{6 - 2n}\\) for \\(n\\) from 0 to 6.\n\nTherefore, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), resulting in terms like \\(6a^2b^2 \\times \\dbinom{6}{n}c^{6 - 2n}\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 64, as calculated earlier. So, 6 * 64 = 384. Therefore, the coefficient is 384.\n\nWait, but let me confirm that the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is indeed 64. To find the sum of coefficients, we set \\(c = 1\\), so \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). Yes, that's correct. So, the sum of coefficients is 64, and multiplying by 6 gives 384. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 384.\n\nWait, but another way to think about it is that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, it's 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial. But the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, so perhaps it's 6 times the sum of the coefficients, which is 64, giving 384.\n\nYes, I think that makes sense. So, the final answer is 384.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{384}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem.\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\):\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\n   \\]\n   So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\n2. **Consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   The sum of the coefficients in this expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\):\n   \\[\n   \\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\n   \\]\n\n3. **Combine the results:**\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is the product of the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) and the sum of the coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 64 = 384\n   \\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{384}\\)."

    "text": " So, maybe I don't need to consider the \\(c\\) terms at all? Or do I? Wait, no, because when you multiply two polynomials, each term from the first polynomial is multiplied by each term from the second. But since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), that means we only need the constant term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), right? Because when we multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by a term from the second polynomial, we only want the part where \\(c\\) cancels out, so that the result is a term without \\(c\\), hence contributing to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, let me check: \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Again, using the binomial theorem, this would be \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying the exponents: \\(c^{6 - m} \\times c^{-m} = c^{6 - 2m}\\). We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero because that's the constant term. So, set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\): \\(6 = 2m\\) so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Let me compute that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Now, since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, which is the product of \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we need to multiply the coefficients from each part. The coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the constant term from the other part is 20. So, the total coefficient would be \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Wait, let me make sure I'm not missing anything. So, when you multiply two expressions, each term from the first is multiplied by each term from the second. But since we're only interested in the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present, and the other part has to contribute a constant term (since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\)), so we're correct in taking the constant term from the second expression. Therefore, the coefficient is indeed 6 times 20, which is 120. So, I think that's the answer. Let me just recap to make sure I didn't skip any steps. First, expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is 6. Then, find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20. Multiply these two coefficients together to get 120. Yep, that seems right. I don't think I made any mistakes here. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem.\n\nFirst, we expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n\\]\nWe need the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2, which corresponds to \\(k = 2\\). The coefficient for this term is:\n\\[\n\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\n\\]\n\nNext, we consider the expression \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).

So, when you multiply them together, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) will multiply each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), perhaps the \\(c\\) terms can be treated separately. Wait, but the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from \\((a + b)^4\\), so when we multiply by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by every term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).

Wait, no, that's not quite right. Because when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficients add up in a way that depends on how the terms combine. But in this case, since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are independent of those involving \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).

But wait, that might not be correct because each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but the variables are different, so the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) is to take the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from \\((a + b)^4\\) and multiply it by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that seems like a lot. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are different variables, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would only come from the product of the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in \\((a + b)^4\\) and the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but how do I find the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)? That's equivalent to evaluating the expression at \\(c = 1\\), because substituting \\(c = 1\\) into \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) gives the sum of all coefficients. So, let's compute that. When \\(c = 1\\), \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times 64. Earlier, we found that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. So, 6 multiplied by 64 is 384. Wait, but that seems high. Let me check again. Alternatively, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. The problem asks for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the variables \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are all independent, so when you expand the product, the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from those involving \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean that each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would indeed be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 64. So, 6 * 64 = 384. Therefore, the coefficient is 384. But wait, let me think again. Alternatively, maybe I'm supposed to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) because the problem just says \\(a^2b^2\\). But in the product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by some power of \\(c\\). So, if the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then my previous reasoning is correct. But if it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then I need to find the term where \\(c^0\\) is present in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Hmm, the problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", without specifying any power of \\(c\\). So, I think it's safe to assume that it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), meaning we're summing over all possible powers of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient would be 6 * 64 = 384. But let me verify this by another approach. Alternatively, I can consider that when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficients multiply. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, as we found. The entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is a polynomial in \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). When you multiply 6 by this entire polynomial, every term in it will have a coefficient multiplied by 6. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), resulting in terms like \\(6 \\times \\text{term}\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would indeed be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 64, giving 384. Alternatively, if the problem had asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some specific \\(k\\), we would have to find the coefficient of \\(c^k\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) and then multiply it by 6. But since it's just \\(a^2b^2\\), I think it's safe to assume that all powers of \\(c\\) are included, so we sum all coefficients. Therefore, the final coefficient is 384. But wait, let me check my calculation of the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). To find the sum of coefficients, we set \\(c = 1\\), so \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So that's correct. Therefore, 6 * 64 = 384. So, I think that's the answer.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplying it by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 64.

Wait, but that might not be correct because each term in the second expansion has its own coefficient, so when you multiply, the overall coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all coefficients from the second part. Hmm, but wait, no. Let me think again. When you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms from each polynomial. But in this case, the first polynomial is \\((a + b)^4\\), which only has terms with \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the second polynomial is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which only has terms with \\(c\\). So, when you multiply them, each term in the first will be multiplied by each term in the second, but since the variables are different, the terms don't interfere with each other. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the entire expansion of the second part, because the second part doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. Wait, but that seems a bit confusing. Let me try to clarify. Suppose I have \\( (a + b)^4 \\times (c + 1/c)^6 \\). When I expand this, each term from \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term from \\((c + 1/c)^6\\). So, for example, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second part. But since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), the coefficient would be the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all coefficients from the second part. But wait, no, that's not quite right. Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, each of those will have a different power of \\(c\\), but the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would just be \\(6 \\times\\) the entire expansion of \\((c + 1/c)^6\\), but that doesn't make sense because the expansion of \\((c + 1/c)^6\\) is a polynomial in \\(c\\), not a constant. Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think differently. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression. So, in other words, when you multiply out \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\((c + 1/c)^6\\), what is the coefficient for the term that has \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, since the second part doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by every term from the second part, each with their own coefficients. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all coefficients from the second part. Wait, but that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of the coefficients of \\((c + 1/c)^6\\). But wait, the sum of the coefficients of a polynomial is found by plugging in \\(c = 1\\). So, if I evaluate \\(\\left(1 + 1/1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of the coefficients of \\((c + 1/c)^6\\) is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times 64, which is 384. Wait, but that seems too straightforward. Let me check that again. Alternatively, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question. Maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, without considering the \\(c\\) terms. So, in other words, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by any power of \\(c\\). But when you multiply two polynomials, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in the second polynomial, so the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will indeed be the coefficient from the first part times the entire second polynomial. But that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times \\((c + 1/c)^6\\), which is a polynomial, not a constant. But the question is asking for the coefficient, which is a number, so perhaps I'm missing something here. Wait, maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), i.e., the constant term in the entire product. Because otherwise, the coefficient would involve terms with different powers of \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense as a single coefficient. So, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where the exponents of \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are 2, 2, and 0, respectively. That would make more sense. So, let me re-examine the problem: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" Hmm, the way it's written, it's just \\(a^2b^2\\), without any \\(c\\) terms. So, perhaps the question is indeed asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). But in that case, as I thought earlier, the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\((c + 1/c)^6\\), which is a polynomial, not a single coefficient. That doesn't make sense because a coefficient should be a number, not an expression. Therefore, maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where the exponents of \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are 2, 2, and 0, respectively. That would make more sense. So, perhaps I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\). Let me proceed under that assumption. So, to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), I need to consider the product of the coefficients from each part. So, from \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, as I found earlier. From \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), I need the coefficient of \\(c^0\\), because I want the overall exponent of \\(c\\) to be 0. So, let's find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). To do that, I can use the binomial theorem again. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(1/c\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, we want the exponent of \\(c\\) to be 0, which means \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part is 20. Now, since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is the product of the coefficients from each part, we multiply 6 (from the first part) by 20 (from the second part). So, 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is 120. But wait, let me make sure I'm interpreting the problem correctly. The original problem says, \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\" without specifying anything about \\(c\\). So, perhaps the question is indeed asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). But in that case, as I thought earlier, the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial, not a single number. That doesn't make sense because a coefficient should be a scalar. Therefore, it's more logical that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where \\(a\\) is squared, \\(b\\) is squared, and \\(c\\) is to the zero power. So, under that interpretation, the coefficient is 120. Alternatively, if the problem is indeed asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which would mean the coefficient is \\(6 \\times (c + 1/c)^6\\), but that's a polynomial, not a number. Since the problem asks for a coefficient, which is a number, I think the correct interpretation is that it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. Therefore, the final answer is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by considering the terms from each part of the product that contribute to \\(a^2b^2c^0\\).\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\):**  \n   Using the binomial theorem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n\n2. **Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**  \n   Using the binomial theorem, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n\n3. **Multiply the coefficients:**  \n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer:**  \nThe coefficient is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by every term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). However, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would just be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but since we're only interested in the coefficient, and the problem doesn't specify any particular power of \\(c\\), I think the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) is just 6 times the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, that doesn't sound right. Actually, no, because when you multiply two expressions, each term's coefficient is the product of the coefficients from each part. But since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\), the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that's not correct because each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) has its own coefficient, and when multiplied by 6, each would contribute to different terms in the overall expansion. But since the problem doesn't specify any particular power of \\(c\\), perhaps it's just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by all possible terms in the \\(c\\) part. But that seems a bit confusing. Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think again. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), and when multiplied by any term from the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), it will produce terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2c^{-k}\\), where \\(k\\) is some integer. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in other words, we're looking for all terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) appears, multiplied by any power of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, the coefficient would be 6 * 64 = 384. But that seems high. Let me check. Alternatively, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\), so the constant term in the \\(c\\) part. That would make more sense because otherwise, the coefficient would be a sum over all possible \\(c\\) terms, which might not be what the problem is asking. Let me reread the problem: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, it's just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, that would mean that I need to consider all possible terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present, which would involve multiplying \\(a^2b^2\\) by every term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). As I thought earlier, the sum of coefficients in a polynomial is found by plugging in 1 for all variables. So, setting \\(c = 1\\), \\(\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = (2)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the total coefficient would be 6 * 64 = 384. But wait, that seems too straightforward. Let me think again. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\), which is the constant term. That would make sense because otherwise, the coefficient would be a combination of multiple terms with different powers of \\(c\\). Let me try that approach. So, if I need the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), that would require finding the term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) that has \\(c^0\\), which is the constant term, and then multiplying it by the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6. So, first, let me find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We want the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), \\(6 = 2k\\) implies \\(k = 3\\). So, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\), which is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire expression is 6 * 20 = 120. But wait, the problem didn't specify \\(c^0\\), it just said the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, perhaps I was right the first time, that it's 384. But I'm confused now because the problem could be interpreted in two ways: either the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), or the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). Let me check the problem statement again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" It doesn't specify anything about \\(c\\), so it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, which would include all possible powers of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 64, giving 384. But wait, that seems too large. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering only the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by the constant term in the \\(c\\) part, so 20, giving 6*20=120. Hmm, I'm not sure. Let me think about how the problem is structured. The expression is a product of two polynomials: one in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the other in \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). When you multiply them, each term from the first polynomial is multiplied by each term from the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by every term in the second part, which has different powers of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial, because each term in the second polynomial contributes its coefficient to the product. So, the sum of coefficients in the second polynomial is indeed 64, so 6*64=384. But let me verify that. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the sense that it's multiplied by \\(c^0\\), which would be 120. I think I need to clarify this. Let me consider the entire expression: \\((a + b)^4\\) gives terms up to \\(a^4b^0\\) and \\(a^0b^4\\), and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) gives terms with various powers of \\(c\\). When you multiply them, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term from the second part, each with their own power of \\(c\\). So, in the entire product, the term \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) will have a coefficient of 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^k\\) in the second polynomial. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is not a single number but a combination of coefficients multiplied by different powers of \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", which is a bit ambiguous. However, in algebra, when you're asked for the coefficient of a specific term without specifying other variables, it usually refers to the coefficient regardless of the other variables. So, in this case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the entire second polynomial, meaning that the coefficient is 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that can't be right because the coefficient should be a numerical value, not a polynomial. Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. Let me think again. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. So, in the product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by every term from the second polynomial. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the entire second polynomial. But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. Therefore, I think the problem must be asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by the constant term in the second polynomial. That would make sense because then the coefficient would be a number. So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 20, so 6*20=120. Therefore, the answer is 120. But I'm still a bit confused because the problem didn't specify the \\(c^0\\) part. Let me try to think of it another way. If I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = (2)^6 = 64\\), and \\((a + b)^4\\) evaluated at \\(a = 1\\), \\(b = 1\\) is 16. So, the total expression evaluated at \\(a=1\\), \\(b=1\\), \\(c=1\\) is 16*64=1024. But the sum of all coefficients in the entire expression would be 1024. However, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the sum of coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 6*64=384, as I thought earlier. But when I set \\(c=1\\), the entire expression becomes 16*64=1024, which is the sum of all coefficients. But if I want just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\), it's 6*64=384. Alternatively, if I want the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), it's 6*20=120. I think the problem is more likely asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), so 120. Let me check that again. The problem says: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" It doesn't mention \\(c\\), so perhaps it's considering all possible powers of \\(c\\). But in that case, the coefficient would be a polynomial, which doesn't make sense. Therefore, I think the intended interpretation is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. So, to confirm, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part is 20, so 6*20=120. Therefore, the final answer is 120.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break down the problem into two parts:\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\)**:\n   Using the binomial theorem, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\) in the expansion:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2}a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\n   \\]\n   So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\n2. **Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)**:\n   We need the constant term (where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0).

But wait, the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is obtained by setting \\(c = 1\\), so that would be \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times 64, which is 384. But wait, that seems too big. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, but since \\(c\\) is separate, the coefficient would just be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), not a single number. So, maybe I'm misinterpreting the problem. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, considering all possible terms. So, in other words, when you multiply out \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by all the terms from the \\(c\\) expansion, so the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the \\(c\\) expansion. But that would again give 6 times 64, which is 384. But I'm not sure if that's the case. Alternatively, maybe the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without considering the \\(c\\) terms, which would just be 6. But that seems unlikely because the entire expression includes the \\(c\\) terms. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), meaning the constant term in \\(c\\). So, that would require me to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by the constant term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, in that case, I would need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is the middle term when the exponent is even. Let me calculate that. The general term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). The exponent of \\(c\\) is \\(6 - 2k\\), so to find the constant term, we set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\). So, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\) would be 6 times 20, which is 120. So, maybe that's the answer. But let me check again. The problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", without specifying any power of \\(c\\), which is a bit confusing. But in the context of such problems, sometimes they ask for the coefficient of a specific term, considering all other variables, so perhaps they mean the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times any power of \\(c\\), which would be 6 times the entire expansion, but that seems too broad. Alternatively, if they are treating \\(c\\) as another variable, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that's a polynomial, not a single coefficient. So, perhaps the intended interpretation is that they want the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by the constant term in \\(c\\), which is 20, so 6 times 20 is 120. Alternatively, maybe they just want the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and not considering the \\(c\\) terms. But that seems unlikely because the entire expression includes the \\(c\\) terms. Wait, perhaps the problem is written as \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), and they are asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial, but if we're just considering the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), it's 6 times each term in the \\(c\\) expansion. But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, which doesn't make sense because the question is asking for a single coefficient. Therefore, perhaps the correct interpretation is that they want the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), which is 120. Alternatively, maybe the problem is written incorrectly, and they meant \\((a + b + c + 1/c)^{10}\\) or something, but that's not the case here. So, to summarize, I think the intended answer is 120, which is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times the constant term in the \\(c\\) expansion. So, I'll go with that.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplying it by the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20. Therefore, the final coefficient is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\boxed{120}"

    "text": " So, maybe the terms involving \\(c\\) don't affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)? Wait, no, that doesn't make sense because the entire expression is a product of two polynomials, so the coefficients would multiply. Wait, no, actually, no. Wait, because when you multiply two expressions, each term in the first expression is multiplied by each term in the second expression. But in this case, the first part is \\((a + b)^4\\) and the second part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the variables involved are \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\), but the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is only in terms of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and doesn't involve \\(c\\). So, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by every term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), or maybe it's only considering the coefficient in front of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\)? Wait, no, that can't be right because the entire expression is a product, so each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), that would be the coefficient in \\((a + b)^4\\) times each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but since \\(a^2b^2\\) is independent of \\(c\\), maybe the coefficient is just the product of the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) and the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)? Wait, no, that doesn't make sense because each term in the product would involve both \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms multiplied by \\(c\\) terms. Wait, perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, that would mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that might not be correct because when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficients multiply. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^k\\) would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^k\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), without any restriction on \\(c\\). Hmm, maybe the problem is considering \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, so the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me read the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, perhaps the problem is just looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that doesn't make sense because each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is a different power of \\(c\\), so when you multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), you'd have terms like \\(6a^2b^2c^k\\) for various \\(k\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But the sum of all coefficients in a polynomial is found by plugging in 1 for all variables. So, in this case, the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) would be \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times 64, which is 384. But wait, that seems high. Let me think again. Alternatively, maybe the problem is only considering terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, so the coefficient would be 6 times each coefficient from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that would mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the entire expansion, which is not a single number. So, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Alternatively, maybe the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2 and the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0. That would make sense because then we're looking for a specific term. So, in that case, the coefficient would be the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me check that approach. So, first, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, as I found earlier. Now, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) would be the middle term, since the exponents go from 6 to -6 in steps of 2. Wait, no, let me think. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, the exponent of \\(c\\) in each term is \\(6 - 2k\\). We want the term where the exponent is 0, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire expression would be 6 times 20, which is 120. So, the answer is 120. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let me go through it again. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is indeed 6. The coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\) which is 20. Multiplying them together gives 6 * 20 = 120. So, that seems correct. Alternatively, if the problem was asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without considering \\(c\\), then it would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384. But that interpretation doesn't make much sense because the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would then be multiplied by various powers of \\(c\\), so the coefficient would actually be a polynomial, not a single number. So, the more reasonable interpretation is that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. Therefore, I think the correct answer is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). The coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying these gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\boxed{120}"

So, when we expand the entire expression, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by every term from the other expansion. But the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would then be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make much sense because the question is asking for a coefficient, which is typically a constant. So, maybe I'm misinterpreting the question. Alternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), which is the constant term. That would make sense because otherwise, the coefficient would involve \\(c\\). So, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is the term where \\(a\\) is squared, \\(b\\) is squared, and \\(c\\) is to the zero power. That would mean we need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times the constant term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me check that. So, first, as before, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. Now, the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. So, let's find that. Using the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be zero, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which implies \\(m = 3\\). So, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire expression is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) (assuming it's multiplied by \\(c^0\\)) is 120. Alternatively, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, then it would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which would make the coefficient a polynomial. But since the problem just says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", it's more likely that it's asking for the coefficient when considering the entire expression as a polynomial in \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\), and specifically looking for the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present, which would require the \\(c\\) terms to cancel out, i.e., the constant term in the \\(c\\) expansion.

Wait, but that doesn't make sense because when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first polynomial gets multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. But in this case, since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and that term doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), maybe the coefficient remains 6 regardless of the other terms.

But actually, the \\(c\\) expansion is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which can be expanded using the binomial theorem as well. Let me do that. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). Now, when I multiply this by \\(6a^2b^2\\), each term becomes \\(6 \\times \\dbinom{6}{k} a^2b^2 c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, in the entire product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by various powers of \\(c\\), each with their own coefficients. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). Wait, that can't be, because each term would have a different power of \\(c\\). So, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when considering all possible terms, meaning the sum of all coefficients where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. But that would mean adding up all the coefficients from the \\(c\\) expansion and multiplying by 6. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, considering that the \\(c\\) terms can be anything, so the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the \\(c\\) expansion. Wait, but the sum of all coefficients in the \\(c\\) expansion would be when we set \\(c = 1\\). So, let me compute that. If I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of all coefficients in the \\(c\\) expansion is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). Wait, but that seems too straightforward. Let me check again. Alternatively, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. But in that case, every term in the expansion would have \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by some power of \\(c\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the \\(c\\) expansion, which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. But wait, another thought: perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some specific \\(k\\), but the problem doesn't specify \\(k\\), so maybe it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) irrespective of \\(c\\), which would mean summing over all possible \\(k\\), so yes, 6 * 64 = 384. But let me think again. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, without considering the \\(c\\) terms, which would mean that the coefficient is 6, but that seems unlikely because the \\(c\\) terms are part of the product. Wait, no, actually, when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficients can be combined. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 * 64 = 384. Hmm, but I'm not entirely sure. Let me try a different approach. Maybe I can consider the entire product as a product of two independent expansions. So, \\((a + b)^4\\) has terms up to \\(a^4\\) and \\(b^4\\), and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) has terms involving \\(c^6\\) down to \\(c^{-6}\\). When you multiply them together, each term from \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term from the \\(c\\) expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in the \\(c\\) expansion, which gives \\(6a^2b^2 \\times \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be \\(6 \\times \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k}\\), because each term in the \\(c\\) expansion has a coefficient \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}\\), and when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), the coefficient becomes \\(6 \\times \\dbinom{6}{k}\\). Therefore, the total coefficient would be \\(6 \\times \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k}\\). But the sum of the binomial coefficients for \\(n = 6\\) is \\(2^6 = 64\\), as I calculated earlier. So, \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 384. Wait, but let me confirm this by considering specific terms. Alternatively, perhaps I can think of the entire expression as a product, and the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the product of the coefficients from each part, but only when the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) match. But in this case, since \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) doesn't affect the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients from the \\(c\\) expansion. So, that would be 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, maybe the problem is simpler: perhaps it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then the \\(c\\) part is irrelevant because it's multiplied by something else. But that doesn't make sense because the entire product is being considered. Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think differently. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when you expand the product, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in the \\(c\\) expansion, which would give terms like \\(6a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(6a^2b^2c^4\\), ..., down to \\(6a^2b^2c^{-6}\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the \\(c\\) expansion, which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. Therefore, the coefficient is 384. But let me check this another way. Suppose I set \\(c = 1\\). Then, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the product becomes \\((a + b)^4 * 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 64 * 6 = 384, which matches my previous result. So, that seems to confirm it. Therefore, I think the coefficient is 384.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break down the problem as follows:\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\), so its coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n\n2. **Consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n   \\]\n   The sum of all coefficients in this expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), resulting in \\(2^6 = 64\\).\n\n3. **Multiply the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) by the sum of coefficients from the \\(c\\) expansion:**\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 64 = 384\n   \\]\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{384}\\)."

Since the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just a scalar multiple, and the rest of the terms are multiplied by the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 multiplied by whatever the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because \\(c^0\\) is the constant term. Wait, is that right? Because if I multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by any term from the other expansion that has \\(c\\) raised to some power, then the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by that term, but the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not considering any \\(c\\) terms. So, maybe I'm overcomplicating it.

Hmm, maybe I should clarify what the problem is asking. It says, \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, perhaps it's considering the entire expression as a product, and we're looking for the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present, regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). But that seems a bit strange because the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by various powers of \\(c\\), so the coefficient would be a function of \\(c\\). Alternatively, maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where \\(a\\) is squared, \\(b\\) is squared, and \\(c\\) is to the zero power. That would make sense because then it's a single coefficient. So, perhaps the problem is implicitly considering the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\), so the coefficient would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, let me check that. So, first, the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) for \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. Then, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me expand that. Again, using the binomial theorem, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the exponent of \\(c\\) in each term is \\(6 - 2m\\). I need the term where the exponent is 0, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire expression is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). So, the answer should be 120. Let me just double-check to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. First, expanding \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Then, expanding \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is when \\(m = 3\\), so \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying those together gives 120. Yeah, that seems correct.

But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term in the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) variables, and the other part is in \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), perhaps the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just the same as the coefficient in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, no, that doesn't make sense because when you multiply, each term from the first expansion is multiplied by every term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part would be multiplied by every term in the second part. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 (from \\(a^2b^2\\)) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, is that correct? Let me think again. No, actually, when you multiply two expressions, the coefficients of specific terms in the product are obtained by multiplying the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each factor. But in this case, the first factor is \\((a + b)^4\\) and the second is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\), and \\(1/c\\) are all different variables, the only way a term like \\(a^2b^2\\) can appear in the product is if it's multiplied by a term that doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), right? Because otherwise, the term would have \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or something, which isn't what we're looking for. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) (i.e., the constant term) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by \\(c^0\\), you get \\(a^2b^2\\), which is the term we're interested in. So, that makes sense. So, I need to find two things: 1) the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which I already found as 6, and 2) the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Then, I multiply these two coefficients together to get the final coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product. So, let's work on finding the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Again, I can use the binomial theorem here. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying each term, that becomes \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m}\\) which is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, each term has an exponent of \\(6 - 2m\\). We need the term where the exponent is 0, because that's the constant term. So, set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the term with \\(c^0\\) is when \\(m = 3\\). The coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Now, going back to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the product of the two coefficients we found: 6 (from \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\)) and 20 (from \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)). So, 6 multiplied by 20 is 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is 120. Wait, let me double-check to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. So, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). In \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the constant term is when the exponent is 0, which occurs at \\(m = 3\\), and \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying them gives 6 * 20 = 120. Yeah, that seems right.

    "text": " So, perhaps I don't need to consider the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), unless it affects the \\(a^2b^2\\) term.

So, if I have \\((a + b)^4\\) times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first part will be multiplied by every term in the second part.

Wait, but that doesn't seem right because the second part is being multiplied, so every term in the first part is multiplied by every term in the second part. But since I'm only interested in the \\(a^2b^2\\) term, the coefficient will be 6 multiplied by the entire sum of the second expansion.

When you expand this, each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).

But the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), without any restriction on \\(c\\). So, does that mean that the coefficient is \\(6\\) times the entire expansion of the second part? That doesn't seem right because the problem expects a numerical coefficient, not an expression involving \\(c\\). Hmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding the question. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, it's possible that the question is considering \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\), and \\(1/c\\) as variables, and it's asking for the coefficient of the term where \\(a\\) is squared, \\(b\\) is squared, and \\(c\\) is raised to some power, but the problem doesn't specify any particular power for \\(c\\). So, perhaps the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(6\\) times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. Wait, but the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion is when \\(c = 1\\). So, if I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). But wait, let me check that again. Alternatively, maybe I'm supposed to consider that the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\) and is multiplied by every term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), so the coefficient would be \\(6\\) times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). But I'm not entirely sure if that's the correct approach. Let me think differently. Maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some \\(k\\), but since it's not specified, perhaps it's just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would indeed be \\(6 \\times\\) the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only considering terms where \\(c\\) is raised to the zero power, meaning \\(c^0\\), so that the term is a pure \\(a^2b^2\\). But in that case, I would need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\), because to get \\(c^0\\), you need to choose 3 terms of \\(c\\) and 3 terms of \\(1/c\\). So, then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Hmm, now I'm confused because I'm getting two different answers depending on the interpretation. Let me try to clarify the problem statement again. The problem says: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, it's possible that the problem is treating \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\), and \\(1/c\\) as separate variables, and it's looking for the coefficient of the term where \\(a\\) is squared, \\(b\\) is squared, and \\(c\\) is raised to any power. But that would mean that the coefficient is the sum over all possible \\(c\\) exponents of the product of the coefficients. But that seems a bit odd because the problem is likely expecting a single numerical coefficient. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the entire expression as a polynomial in \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\), and \\(1/c\\), and it's asking for the coefficient of the term \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some \\(k\\), but since it's not specified, maybe it's just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\). But that would mean that the coefficient is \\(6\\) times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). Alternatively, if the problem is only interested in the term where \\(c\\) is also squared, then perhaps I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^2\\) in the second expansion and multiply that by 6. Wait, but the problem doesn't specify any power for \\(c\\), so I think the first interpretation is correct. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be \\(6\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). But let me verify this by expanding the expressions step by step.\n\nFirst, expand \\((a + b)^4\\). As we did earlier, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6.\n\nNow, expand \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem, this is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(1/c\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\).\n\nSo, each term in this expansion is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\) for \\(k = 0\\) to \\(6\\).\n\nNow, when we multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, resulting in terms like \\(6a^2b^2 \\times \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\).\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^{6 - 2k}\\) is \\(6 \\times \\dbinom{6}{k}\\) for each \\(k\\). But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), we need to sum all these coefficients for all possible \\(k\\). That is, the total coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) across all powers of \\(c\\) is \\(6 \\times \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k}\\).\n\nBut the sum \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k}\\) is equal to \\(2^6 = 64\\), since the sum of binomial coefficients for a given \\(n\\) is \\(2^n\\). Therefore, the total coefficient is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\nWait, but earlier I thought maybe the problem wanted the coefficient where \\(c\\) is also squared, but now I think that's not the case because the problem doesn't specify any power for \\(c\\). So, the answer should be 384.\n\nBut let me check again. Suppose the problem had specified a particular power for \\(c\\), say \\(c^0\\), then the coefficient would be \\(6 \\times \\dbinom{6}{3} = 6 \\times 20 = 120\\). But since it's not specified, I think the correct interpretation is that it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), which would be 384.\n\nWait, but let me think again. If the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then yes, it's the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion multiplied by 6. So, 6 times 64 is 384.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem had said \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\)\", then it would be 120. But as it stands, I think the answer is 384.\n\nWait, but let me check by another method. Let's consider that when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each polynomial. So, in this case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial is 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^k\\) in the second polynomial is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}\\) for some \\(k\\). But since the problem isn't specifying any \\(k\\), the total coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) across all \\(k\\) is indeed the sum over all \\(k\\) of \\(6 \\times \\dbinom{6}{k}\\), which is 6 times 64, so 384.\n\nWait, but perhaps the problem is expecting just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), without considering the \\(c\\) terms. That is, maybe it's treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable and wants the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. In that case, the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of the second polynomial, but that would result in a polynomial where each term has \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by some power of \\(c\\). But since the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), perhaps it's considering that coefficient as 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 times 64, which is 384.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem is only interested in the term where \\(c\\) is raised to the zero power, then the coefficient would be 6 times \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\), which is 6 times 20, which is 120.\n\nWait, but the problem statement is: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, it's not specifying any condition on \\(c\\), which suggests that it's considering all possible powers of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the sum over all \\(k\\) of \\(6 \\times \\dbinom{6}{k}\\), which is 6 times 64, so 384.\n\nBut let me think again: when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a term in the product is the sum of the products of the coefficients of the terms in each polynomial that multiply together to give that term. So, in this case, to get \\(a^2b^2\\), you take the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) from the first polynomial and multiply it by every term in the second polynomial. So, each term in the product will be \\(6a^2b^2 \\times \\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the sum of all coefficients from the second polynomial multiplied by 6. Since the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial is when \\(c = 1\\), which is \\(2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\nWait, but let me confirm this by considering specific values. Suppose I set \\(c = 1\\), then the second polynomial becomes \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, the product becomes \\((a + b)^4 \\times 64\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). That makes sense.\n\nAlternatively, if I set \\(c = t\\), then the second polynomial is \\((t + 1/t)^6\\), and when I multiply by \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(6\\) times the sum of the coefficients of all terms in \\((t + 1/t)^6\\), which is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\nTherefore, I think the correct answer is 384.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit uncertain because sometimes in such problems, they might be asking for the coefficient of a specific term, like \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be 120. But since the problem doesn't specify, I think the answer is 384.\n\nWait, but let me check one more time. The problem is: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, it's only specifying \\(a^2b^2\\), without any mention of \\(c\\). So, in the product, \\(a^2b^2\\) can be multiplied by any power of \\(c\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would include all those possibilities. Therefore, the coefficient is the sum over all \\(k\\) of \\(6 \\times \\dbinom{6}{k}\\), which is 6 times 64, which is 384.\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, the final answer is 384.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{384}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem for both parts of the expression.\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\):\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\n   \\]\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in this part is 6.\n\n2. **Consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n   \\]\n   The sum of all coefficients in this expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\):\n   \\[\n   (1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\n   \\]\n\n3. **Combine the results:**\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the product of the coefficient from the first expansion and the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion:\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 64 = 384\n   \\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{384}."

But in this case, the \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) part will contribute a term that might affect the overall coefficient. Wait, no, actually, the \\(c\\) terms are separate from \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), so when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are independent of those involving \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, does that mean that the coefficient is just 6, or do I need to consider something else? Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think again. The expression is \\((a + b)^4\\) times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When you multiply two polynomials, each term from the first polynomial is multiplied by each term from the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from \\((a + b)^4\\), and it's multiplied by every term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, it's just the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, no, that doesn't make sense because the coefficient would then be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which isn't correct. Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, they're treating the entire product as a single expression, and they want the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. That is, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) can be multiplied by any power of \\(c\\), but we're just looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) irrespective of the \\(c\\) part. So, in other words, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is equal to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that can't be right because the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) has multiple terms, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, no, that's not correct. Let me think differently. When you multiply two expressions, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is not what we want. Wait, maybe I'm approaching this wrong. Let me consider that the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from \\((a + b)^4\\), and when multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), it's just multiplied by each term in that expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) will multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term, contributing to the overall coefficient. So, the coefficient we're looking for is 6 multiplied by the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, the sum of the coefficients in a polynomial is found by setting all variables to 1. So, in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), if we set \\(c = 1\\), we get \\((1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of the coefficients is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times 64, which is 384. Wait, but that seems too large. Let me check again. Alternatively, maybe I'm supposed to consider that the \\(c\\) terms don't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just 6, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. But that doesn't seem right because when you multiply, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually be 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me try a different approach. Let's consider that when we multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each polynomial. But in this case, the two polynomials are in different variables: one is in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the other is in \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, the variables are independent. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is simply the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial in \\(c\\), not a numerical coefficient. Wait, but the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not considering \\(c\\). So, perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. In other words, the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 6 times 64, as I thought earlier, which is 384. But let me verify this because I might be making a mistake. Alternatively, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the coefficient from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) for each term, but since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that can't be, because the coefficient should be a number, not a polynomial. So, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, maybe the problem is considering the entire expression as a polynomial in \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\), and \\(1/c\\), and it's asking for the coefficient of the term \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). That is, the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\), but the problem is just asking for the coefficient, so perhaps it's 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems unlikely because the problem probably expects a numerical answer. Alternatively, maybe I'm supposed to consider that the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by all possible terms from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would then be 6 times the entire expansion, which isn't a single number. I'm confused now. Let me try to think differently. Perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\). That would make sense because then the coefficient would be a number. So, maybe I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product. Let me assume that's the case. So, to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), I need to consider the product of the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from \\((a + b)^4\\) and the term \\(c^0\\) from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, first, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, as I found earlier. Now, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me expand that. Using the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, we need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, which means \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(m = 3\\). So, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Now, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product is the product of the coefficients from each part, which is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). So, the coefficient is 120. Wait, but the problem didn't specify \\(c^0\\), it just said \\(a^2b^2\\). So, perhaps I was correct earlier that the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion, but that doesn't make sense because it's not a single number. Alternatively, if the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, then the coefficient would indeed be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But since the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, I think it's more likely that they want the coefficient when considering \\(c^0\\), so 120. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and since the other terms involve \\(c\\), the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion, but that seems odd because the coefficient should be a number. Maybe I should check the problem again. It says: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, maybe they are treating the entire expression as a polynomial in \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\), and \\(1/c\\), and they want the coefficient of the term \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) part. So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 6 times 64, as I thought earlier, which is 384. But that seems high. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, without considering \\(c\\), which would be 6, but that seems too simple. Wait, perhaps I should think of it as the product of two independent polynomials. So, when you have two polynomials multiplied together, the coefficient of a specific term in one polynomial is multiplied by the entire other polynomial. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would make the coefficient a polynomial, not a number. So, perhaps the problem is misworded, and they actually want the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some \\(k\\), but since it's not specified, I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that's not a single number. I'm getting confused here. Let me try to think of it differently. Maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). As I calculated earlier, the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 64, so 6 times 64 is 384. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 384. But I'm not entirely sure if this is the correct interpretation. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, considering all possible terms involving \\(c\\), which would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion, but that can't be a single number. I think the intended interpretation is that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 6 times 64, so 384. Therefore, the coefficient is 384. But let me verify this with an example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^1 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, expanding, we get \\(a c + a \\cdot \\dfrac{1}{c} + b c + b \\cdot \\dfrac{1}{c}\\). The coefficient of \\(a^1b^0\\) would be \\(c + 1/c\\), but if we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^1b^0\\) regardless of \\(c\\), it's just 1 times \\((c + 1/c)\\). But if we set \\(c = 1\\), the sum of coefficients is 2, so the coefficient would be 1 times 2 = 2. But in reality, the coefficient is \\(c + 1/c\\), which isn't a number unless \\(c\\) is specified. So, perhaps the problem is expecting me to set \\(c = 1\\), which would make the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) equal to 6 times 64, which is 384. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which would mean the coefficient is 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but that's a polynomial, not a number. I think the most reasonable interpretation is that the problem wants the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, considering all possible \\(c\\) terms, which would be 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But since the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, I think they must have meant the coefficient when considering \\(c^0\\), which would be 6 times 20, which is 120. Let me check that again. In \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is 6 times 20, which is 120. Therefore, I think the correct answer is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is found by considering the contributions from both parts of the expression. \n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\)**: Using the binomial theorem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n\n2. **Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)**: We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0.

The coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n\n3. **Multiply the coefficients**: The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

So, if I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), that term in the product would be \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, maybe the coefficient is just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the entire expansion of the second part. Wait, but that would make the coefficient a polynomial in \\(c\\), but the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which I think is a numerical coefficient, so maybe I need to consider the part that doesn't involve \\(c\\). Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the entire expression, and we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, in that case, the coefficient would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all terms in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But I think that's not the case. Let me clarify: when you have two expressions multiplied together, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each expression. So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), it's the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part, because \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't have any \\(c\\) terms. Wait, that makes more sense. Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by a term from the second expansion, the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is if you multiply it by \\(c^0\\), which is 1. So, the coefficient would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part. So, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me work that out. Using the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, we need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, which means \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), \\(6 = 2m\\) so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the coefficient from the second part, which is 20. So, 6 times 20 is 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120. Wait, let me double-check that. So, in the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. In the second part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. So, when you multiply these two, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by 20, so the coefficient becomes 6 * 20 = 120. Yeah, that seems right. Alternatively, if I think about the entire product, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) would be 6 * 20 = 120, and since we're only interested in \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, the coefficient is 120. Wait, but actually, the problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", which might imply that we're considering the entire expression as a polynomial in \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\), and \\(1/c\\), and we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). But in that case, the coefficient would actually be the sum over all possible exponents of \\(c\\) multiplied by the corresponding terms. Wait, no, that's not correct. Because when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in one polynomial is independent of the other. So, if I'm looking for \\(a^2b^2\\), it's only the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient would actually be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that can't be right because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, not an expression. So, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, considering all possible terms from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which would be 6 times \\(2^6 = 64\\), so 6 * 64 = 384. But that doesn't seem right because the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20, not 64. Wait, no, the sum of the coefficients in a polynomial is found by setting all variables to 1. So, in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), setting \\(c = 1\\) gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of all coefficients is 64. Therefore, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, it would be 6 times 64, which is 384. But that contradicts my earlier calculation where I got 120. Hmm, so which one is correct? Let me think carefully. When you have \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the expansion would be a product of two polynomials. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part would be multiplied by every term in the second part. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Because each term in the second part contributes a coefficient that multiplies \\(a^2b^2\\). So, that would be 6 * 64 = 384. But earlier, I thought it was 6 * 20 = 120 because I was considering only the \\(c^0\\) term. So, which approach is correct? Let me clarify: If the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then it's 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 6 * 64 = 384. However, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it's 6 * 20 = 120. But the problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", without specifying anything about \\(c\\), so it's ambiguous. However, typically, when a problem asks for the coefficient of a term without specifying other variables, it might be implying that the term should have zero exponent for the other variables. But in this case, since \\(c\\) is another variable, it's unclear. Wait, but in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the variables are \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\). So, when the problem asks for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), it's probably considering all possible exponents of \\(c\\), so the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 6 * 64 = 384. But wait, that doesn't seem right because in the product, each term is a product of terms from each polynomial. So, \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would indeed be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second polynomial. So, 6 * 64 = 384. But earlier, I thought it was 120 because I was only considering the \\(c^0\\) term. Hmm, I'm confused now. Let me check with an example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^1 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, expanding, we get \\(ac + a/c + bc + b/c\\). The coefficient of \\(a^1b^0\\) would be \\(c + 1/c\\), but if we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^1b^0\\) regardless of \\(c\\), it's the sum of coefficients, which would be 2. So, in that case, the coefficient of \\(a^1\\) would be 2. Similarly, in our problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 6 * 64 = 384. But wait, that seems too high. Alternatively, if I'm only interested in the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\), then it's 6 * 20 = 120. So, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), in which case it's 120. But the problem didn't specify \\(c^0\\), so it's ambiguous. Wait, but in the original problem statement, it's written as \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\)\". So, in the context of the entire expression, which includes \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would have coefficients that are multiplied by various powers of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the sum of all coefficients from the second polynomial, because each term in the second polynomial contributes to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384. Wait, but that doesn't feel right because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second polynomial, each term would have a different power of \\(c\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial. So, the sum of coefficients in the second polynomial is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 * 64 = 384. But I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the entire expression as a product, and the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just 6, because the other part is multiplied by \\(c\\) terms, but that seems incorrect because when you multiply, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second, so the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion. Therefore, I think the correct answer is 384. Wait, but earlier I thought it was 120, so I'm confused. Let me try to resolve this. Suppose I have two polynomials, P(a, b) and Q(c). The product P(a, b) * Q(c) would have terms where each term from P is multiplied by each term from Q. So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of a specific term in P(a, b), say \\(a^2b^2\\), then in the product, this term would be multiplied by every term in Q(c). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in P(a, b) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in Q(c). So, in this case, the sum of all coefficients in Q(c) is 64, so the coefficient would be 6 * 64 = 384. Therefore, I think the correct answer is 384. But earlier, I thought it was 120 because I was considering only the \\(c^0\\) term. So, perhaps I was mistaken earlier. Let me confirm with a smaller example. Suppose P(a, b) = (a + b)^1 = a + b, and Q(c) = (c + 1/c)^1 = c + 1/c. Then, the product is (a + b)(c + 1/c) = ac + a/c + bc + b/c. Now, the coefficient of \\(a^1b^0\\) is c + 1/c, but if we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^1b^0\\) regardless of c, it's the sum of coefficients, which is 2. So, in this case, the coefficient of \\(a^1\\) is 2, which is the coefficient in P(a, b) (which is 1) multiplied by the sum of coefficients in Q(c) (which is 2). So, 1 * 2 = 2. Similarly, in our problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 * 64 = 384. Therefore, I think the correct answer is 384. But wait, the problem didn't specify anything about \\(c\\), so it's ambiguous. However, given the structure of the problem, I think it's more likely that they want the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be 120. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the entire product and wants the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) irrespective of \\(c\\), which would be 384. Hmm, I'm not sure. Let me think again. The problem is written as: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\)\". So, in the entire product, \\(a^2b^2\\) can be multiplied by any power of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually be the sum over all terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any power of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, that would be 6 * 64 = 384. Therefore, I think the correct answer is 384. Wait, but in my earlier example, the coefficient of \\(a^1\\) was 2, which is the coefficient in P times the sum of coefficients in Q. So, yes, that seems correct. Therefore, in this problem, it's 6 * 64 = 384. But wait, let me check another example to be sure. Suppose P(a, b) = (a + b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2, and Q(c) = (c + 1/c)^1 = c + 1/c. The product is (a^2 + 2ab + b^2)(c + 1/c) = a^2c + a^2/c + 2abc + 2ab/c + b^2c + b^2/c. Now, the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) in this product would be c + 1/c, but if we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) regardless of c, it's the sum of coefficients, which is 2. So, that's 1 (coefficient of \\(a^2\\) in P) times 2 (sum of coefficients in Q). Similarly, the coefficient of \\(ab\\) would be 2(c + 1/c), so the sum of coefficients would be 4. So, yes, in this case, the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) is 2, which is 1 * 2. Therefore, in our original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 * 64 = 384. Therefore, I think the correct answer is 384. But earlier, I thought it was 120, so I must have been confused. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only considering the term where \\(c^0\\) is present, so it's 6 * 20 = 120. But given the examples, I think the correct interpretation is that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 384. However, I'm not entirely sure, so I'll go with 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Next, we consider the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The sum of all coefficients in this expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), giving \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n\\boxed{384}"

    "text": " So, does that mean I don't need to consider the terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\)? Wait, maybe not. Let me think. The expression is \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, when I expand this product, each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I think that term is independent of \\(c\\). So, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first part will be multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. But wait, that can't be right because then the coefficient would depend on the entire expansion of the second part. Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me re-read it: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, maybe the problem is treating \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) as separate variables, so when we multiply, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. Wait, that seems a bit odd. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the product as a polynomial in \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\), and \\(1/c\\), and we're looking for the coefficient of the term \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't make much sense because then the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\), not a single number. Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again. Perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when considering all possible terms, but since the second part doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would just be 6 times the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, not a single number. Alternatively, maybe the problem is intended to have us consider the entire expansion and find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some \\(k\\), but since it's not specified, perhaps I'm missing something. Wait, no, the problem just says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", so maybe it's treating \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) as separate variables, and the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by all the terms from the second expansion, so the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that seems too involved. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating the second part as a constant. But that doesn't make much sense because the second part isn't a constant. Wait, maybe the problem is a product of two separate expansions, and we're to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, not a single number. Hmm, perhaps I'm misinterpreting the problem. Let me check again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, the expression is a product of two expansions. The first expansion has terms in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), the second in \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). When multiplied together, each term from the first expansion is multiplied by each term from the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion would be multiplied by every term in the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be \\(6 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. Wait, perhaps the problem is only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, but without any constraints on the power of \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but that seems unlikely because the problem expects a numerical answer. Alternatively, maybe I'm supposed to consider that the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by the constant term in the second expansion. Let me think: \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) can be expanded using the binomial theorem as \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(1/c\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, the constant term in this expansion occurs when \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which is when \\(k = 3\\). So, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, if I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times the constant term in the second expansion, then the coefficient would be 6 * 20 = 120. That seems plausible. So, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, considering only the constant term with respect to \\(c\\). That would make sense because otherwise, the coefficient would be a polynomial, which doesn't seem to fit the question. So, to summarize: The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 * 20 = 120. Let me double-check that. So, the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) gives \\(a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6. Then, the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) gives terms where the exponents of \\(c\\) vary. The constant term is when the exponent is zero, which is when \\(k = 3\\), as I found earlier, giving 20. So, multiplying 6 by 20 gives 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 120. I think that's the answer. But just to make sure, let me consider if there's another way to approach this. Alternatively, perhaps I can consider the entire product as a product of two polynomials and then look for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. But in that case, every term in the product would be a product of a term from the first polynomial and a term from the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by every term in the second polynomial. But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), it's likely that it's considering the coefficient as a polynomial in \\(c\\), but that seems unlikely because the problem expects a numerical answer. Therefore, the more reasonable interpretation is that we're to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, considering only the constant term with respect to \\(c\\), which would be 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is found using the binomial theorem, which gives 6. The constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Multiplying these together gives 6 * 20 = 120.\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\boxed{120}."

    "text": " So, maybe I don't need to consider the terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) because they don't affect the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. Wait, let me think again. When you multiply two expressions, each term from the first expression gets multiplied by each term from the second expression. So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I need to find all the terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first part and then, when multiplied by terms from the second part, it remains \\(a^2b^2\\). But the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), only has terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, when I multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by any term from the second expression, the resulting term will have \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by some power of \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\). However, the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, does that mean it's considering the entire expression, so we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\)? Or is it only the coefficient when \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by a specific term from the second expression? Hmm, maybe I misread the problem. Let me check again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, I think it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, that would mean that the coefficient would be the same as the coefficient in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, no, that doesn't make sense because when you multiply by the entire second expression, each term would be multiplied by every term in the second expression. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually be the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all coefficients from the second part. Wait, no, that's not quite right. Let me think again. When you have two expressions multiplied together, say \\(A \\times B\\), the coefficient of a specific term in \\(A\\) times the entire \\(B\\) would mean that term is multiplied by every term in \\(B\\). So, for example, if in \\(A\\) we have a term \\(a^2b^2\\) with coefficient 6, and in \\(B\\) we have terms like \\(c^6\\), \\(6c^4\\), etc., then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^6\\) would be 6, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^4\\) would be 6 times 15, and so on. But the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, does that mean regardless of the power of \\(c\\)? If so, then the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because each term in \\(B\\) would multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term, contributing to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^k\\) for some \\(k\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not considering the \\(c\\) terms. Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, that would be the case if we were considering the entire product and looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) irrespective of the \\(c\\) terms. Alternatively, maybe the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, so the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that doesn't make sense because the coefficient should be a number, not a polynomial in \\(c\\).\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, maybe it's asking for the coefficient of the term \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by any term from the second expression, so the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because each term in the second expression contributes to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when multiplied by the term \\(a^2b^2\\). But wait, the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 * 64 = 384. But that seems too large, and I'm not sure if that's the correct approach. Alternatively, maybe the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, considering that the second expression might contribute a term that is a constant, so that when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), it remains as \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, but \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) doesn't have a constant term unless there's a term where the exponent of \\(c\\) cancels out. Let me check that. The general term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is given by \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, the exponent of \\(c\\) is \\(6 - 2k\\). For this to be a constant term, the exponent must be zero, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\). So, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, the second expression has a constant term of 20. Therefore, when we multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by the constant term 20 from the second part, resulting in a term \\(20a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 20 times 6, which is 120. Wait, but earlier I thought the sum of all coefficients is 64, but that's different. So, which one is correct? Let me clarify. If the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then it would be the sum of all coefficients from the second expression multiplied by the coefficient from the first expression. But that's not correct because each term from the second expression contributes to different terms in the product. Alternatively, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times any power of \\(c\\), then it's just the coefficient from the first part times the entire second expression, but that's not possible because the coefficient should be a scalar, not a polynomial. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only considering the term \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by the constant term from the second expression, which would give the term \\(a^2b^2\\) with coefficient 20 * 6 = 120. That seems more plausible because otherwise, the coefficient would involve \\(c\\) terms, which isn't the case. So, I think the correct approach is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and then multiply it by the constant term from the second part, which is 20, giving 120. Let me verify this. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6a\u00b2b\u00b2. The term \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) has a constant term of 20. So, when you multiply 6a\u00b2b\u00b2 by 20, you get 120a\u00b2b\u00b2. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 120. Alternatively, if the problem had asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some specific \\(k\\), then we would need to consider the corresponding term from the second expression. But since it's just \\(a^2b^2\\), I think it's safe to assume that it's the coefficient when multiplied by the constant term, resulting in 120. So, I think the answer is 120. Let me just recap to make sure I didn't make a mistake. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Multiplying these together gives 120, which is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. Yeah, that makes sense.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is found using the binomial coefficient \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). The constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying these gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\boxed{120}"

    "text": " So, perhaps the \\(c\\) terms don't affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)? Wait, no, because when you multiply two polynomials, each term from the first polynomial gets multiplied by each term from the second. But in this case, since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which only comes from \\((a + b)^4\\), and the other part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which only involves \\(c\\), maybe the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just 6 times whatever the coefficient is in the second part when it's multiplied by 1? Wait, no, that doesn't make sense because when you multiply two expressions, each term from the first is multiplied by each term from the second. But since we're looking for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, and the second expression doesn't have \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), then actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would just be the coefficient from the first part, multiplied by the entire second expression, but since we're looking for the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present, the other factors (from the second expression) would just contribute a coefficient, but not affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again. So, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When you expand this, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which comes from the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\), and the other part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), when multiplied, will just contribute a coefficient for each term. Wait, but no, because the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the first part, so when you multiply by the second part, which is a series in \\(c\\), each term in the first part is multiplied by the entire second part. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the sum of all the coefficients in the second part. Wait, that can't be right because each term in the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, the sum of all the coefficients in a polynomial is found by setting all variables to 1. So, if I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = (2)^6 = 64\\). So, does that mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times 64? That would be 384. But wait, that seems too high. Alternatively, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me check again. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so perhaps I'm supposed to treat the entire expression as a product, and find the coefficient where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2 each, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. But wait, that feels correct, but let me think again. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is just to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, meaning that the coefficient would be 6, because the other part doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. Wait, that's not right because when you multiply two expressions, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, if I have \\((a + b)^4\\) times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), then each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part would be multiplied by each term in the second part. But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in the second part, because each term in the second part is a constant (with respect to \\(a\\) and \\(b\\)), so when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), it just scales the coefficient. So, the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is indeed 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. But wait, let me verify this. Alternatively, perhaps I can think of it as the product of two polynomials, and the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just 6 times the constant term of the second polynomial, but that doesn't seem right because the constant term would be the coefficient of \\(c^0\\). Let me check: \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem, the general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, the term where the exponent is 0 is when \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which is when \\(k = 3\\). So, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, does that mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 * 20 = 120? Wait, that contradicts my earlier conclusion of 384. Hmm, maybe I was wrong before. Let me think carefully. So, when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is multiplied by every term in the second part. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part (which is 6) multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. But wait, no, because the second part is multiplied as a whole, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in the second part, which is 64, as I thought earlier. But then why is the constant term 20? Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by the constant term 20, you get \\(20a^2b^2\\). But also, \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by all other terms in the second expansion, which have coefficients, but those would result in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2 \\times \\dfrac{1}{c^k}\\), so those terms wouldn't be just \\(a^2b^2\\), they'd have extra \\(c\\) terms. So, actually, the only term in the product that is exactly \\(a^2b^2\\) is when it's multiplied by the constant term (i.e., the term with \\(c^0\\)) in the second expansion. So, that would be \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by 20, giving a coefficient of 6 * 20 = 120. So, that makes sense. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 120. Wait, so my initial thought of 384 was wrong because I was considering the sum of all coefficients, which would include all the \\(c\\) terms, but in reality, only the constant term in the second expansion contributes to the term \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms. So, the correct coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120. Let me confirm this with another approach. So, the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), has \\(a^2b^2\\) with coefficient 6. The second part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), when expanded, will have terms involving various powers of \\(c\\). When we multiply the two expansions, each term from the first is multiplied by each term from the second. So, the only way to get a term with \\(a^2b^2\\) is to multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), i.e., the constant term in the second expansion. So, the constant term in the second expansion is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\), as I found earlier. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 * 20 = 120. So, that must be the answer. I think I confused myself earlier by considering the sum of all coefficients, which isn't necessary because only the constant term contributes to the \\(a^2b^2\\) term without any \\(c\\) terms. So, the correct coefficient is 120.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break down the problem as follows:\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\), so its coefficient is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\n   \\]\n\n2. **Consider the second part \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   Using the binomial theorem, the general term is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n   \\]\n   The constant term (where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0) occurs when \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), i.e., \\(k = 3\\).

But since I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), maybe the part with \\(c\\) just contributes a constant factor? Let me think.

But wait, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term doesn't involve \\(c\\), so when I multiply it by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), it's like multiplying by a constant.

Wait, no, that's not quite right. Because when you multiply two expressions, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, if I'm looking for a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), that would be when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, right? Because \\(c^0 = 1\\), so that term would just be a constant. So, maybe I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), and then multiply that by the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\). That makes sense because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by the constant term from the \\(c\\) expansion, you get a term with \\(a^2b^2\\) and no \\(c\\). So, let me calculate that. First, I already found that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. Now, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Hmm, how do I do that? Let me use the binomial theorem again. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying that, it becomes \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). I need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be zero, so I set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), I get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the two coefficients: 6 (from \\(a^2b^2\\)) and 20 (from \\(c^0\\)). So, 6 * 20 = 120. Wait, that seems high. Let me check my reasoning again. When I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second part. But since we're only interested in the terms where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, that is, the constant term, the only contribution comes from the term where \\(c^0\\) in the second part. So, yes, that would be 6 * 20 = 120. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in calculating the binomial coefficients. For \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).

Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Since we're only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\), it's just the coefficient from the first part times the entire second part, because each term in the second part, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), would contribute to the coefficient.

    "text": " So, I think that the terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) might not affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), because \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\). Wait, is that correct? Let me think. So, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the product will have terms that are products of terms from each expansion. But since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are in one part, and \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) are in the other, the only way \\(a^2b^2\\) can appear is if we take the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part and any term from the second part. But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, does that mean that the coefficient is just 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)? Wait, that doesn't seem right. Because if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), it would be 6 times the sum of all terms in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that can't be, because then the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\), but the problem is just asking for the coefficient, not considering \\(c\\). Maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" Hmm, so perhaps the problem is treating \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) as separate variables, and it's looking for the coefficient of the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) appears, regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in other words, in the entire expansion, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) can be multiplied by any power of \\(c\\), but the coefficient would be the sum of all the coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) multiplied by 6. But that would make the coefficient a polynomial in \\(c\\). However, the problem is just asking for the coefficient, so maybe it's expecting a numerical coefficient, considering all possible powers of \\(c\\). Wait, that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), so it's 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But the sum of coefficients in a polynomial is found by setting all variables to 1. So, if I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of coefficients is 64. Then, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 * 64 = 384. Wait, but that seems high. Let me check that again. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Perhaps the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable. So, the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, not a single number. But the problem is asking for the coefficient, which suggests a numerical value. Maybe I'm misinterpreting the problem. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\), which is 1. So, in that case, I would need to find the term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) that gives \\(c^0\\), because when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), that term would give \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). So, the coefficient would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). That makes more sense. So, first, find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), then multiply by 6. Let me compute that. So, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) can be expanded using the binomial theorem as \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the exponent of \\(c\\) is \\(6 - 2m\\). We want the exponent to be 0, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire product is 6 * 20 = 120. So, the final answer is 120. Wait, let me confirm this. Alternatively, perhaps I should consider the entire expansion and see if I missed anything. So, \\((a + b)^4\\) gives 6 for \\(a^2b^2\\), and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) gives 20 for \\(c^0\\). So, multiplying these gives 6 * 20 = 120. Yeah, that seems correct.

So, when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first polynomial gets multiplied by each term in the second.

Hmm, but that doesn't seem right because when you multiply, the \\(c\\) terms will affect the overall expression. Wait, perhaps I'm misinterpreting the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, it's possible that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. That is, when you expand the entire product, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by any power of \\(c\\). But that would be the case if the problem was written as a single expression, but here it's a product of two expressions. Alternatively, maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, considering all possible terms involving \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. But that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which would make the coefficient a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. So, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), that is, the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\). So, in that case, I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), and then multiply those two coefficients together. That makes sense because when you multiply the two expansions, the terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\) would be the product of the individual coefficients. So, let me proceed with that approach. First, as I found earlier, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. Now, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). To do that, I can use the binomial theorem again. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k\\). Simplifying that, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} c^{-k} = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We want the exponent of \\(c\\) to be 0, so we set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Now, the overall coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is the product of the two individual coefficients, which is 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is 120. Wait, but let me double-check that. So, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, and in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. When you multiply these two expansions together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by all terms from the second part, including \\(c^0\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) will have a coefficient of 6 * 20 = 120. So, that's the coefficient we're looking for. Alternatively, if the problem was just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, then the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the entire \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) expansion, which would make the coefficient a polynomial in \\(c\\). But since the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, I think it's safe to assume that it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. So, I think I've arrived at the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by considering the expansion of each part separately and then multiplying the relevant coefficients.\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\)**:\n   - The term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\) in the binomial expansion.\n   - Coefficient: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n\n2. **Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)**:\n   - We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, which occurs when \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), so \\(k = 3\\).\n   - Coefficient: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n\n3. **Combine the coefficients**:\n   - Multiply the coefficients from each expansion: \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer**: The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

Let me think again. When you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first polynomial multiplies each term in the second polynomial. So, if I'm looking for a term with \\(a^2b^2\\), that term comes only from the product of the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in \\((a + b)^4\\) and the constant term (if any) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because if I take any other term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), it will have a power of \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), which would mean that the resulting term in the product would have \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2 \\cdot \\dfrac{1}{c^k}\\), but the problem is only asking for \\(a^2b^2\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me calculate that.

Alternatively, maybe I should consider that when multiplying the two expressions, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are different variables, the only way to get a term with \\(a^2b^2\\) is to take the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part and the constant term from the second part.

    "text": " So, maybe the other part doesn't affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)? Let me think. When you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second. But since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) won't affect the coefficients of \\(a^2b^2\\) because they're independent. So, does that mean the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just 6 times whatever the coefficient is for the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)? Wait, no, because when you multiply, each term from \\((a + b)^4\\) gets multiplied by every term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), that means we're looking for the term where the product doesn't include any \\(c\\) terms. So, in other words, we need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because when we multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), the \\(c\\) terms would have to multiply to 1 to not affect the exponent of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). So, let me find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Again, using the binomial theorem: \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\).

So, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20. Therefore, when we multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by 20 from the second part. So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the second part), which is 6 * 20 = 120. Wait, but let me double-check that. Because when you multiply two polynomials, each term from the first is multiplied by each term in the second. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and that term doesn't involve \\(c\\), we need to find how many ways \\(a^2b^2\\) can come from the product. But actually, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and it gets multiplied by every term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, that would actually be the sum of all the products where the \\(a^2b^2\\) term is multiplied by any term in the second polynomial. But wait, that doesn't make sense because \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term in the first polynomial, and when you multiply it by any term in the second polynomial, you'd get \\(a^2b^2 \\times c^k\\) or something, but the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would mean the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, right? So, actually, the coefficient would be 6 times the constant term in the second polynomial, which is 20, giving 120. Alternatively, if the problem had asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), it would be 120. But since it's just \\(a^2b^2\\), does that mean we consider all possible terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present, regardless of the \\(c\\) exponents? Hmm, that's a good point. Let me think again. The original expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). When you expand this, each term will be of the form \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}a^{4 - k}b^k \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) occurs when \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\), so the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\), which is 6. But this term is then multiplied by every term in the second expansion, which includes various powers of \\(c\\). However, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would include all the terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present, regardless of the power of \\(c\\). But that can't be right because the problem is written as \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), and we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, actually, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term is part of the product, and it's multiplied by all the terms from the second polynomial. So, the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but that doesn't make sense because we're just looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not considering the \\(c\\) terms. Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think of it differently. The expression is a product of two polynomials: one in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and another in \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). Since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are independent variables, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't seem right because when you multiply, each term from the first polynomial is multiplied by each term from the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part would be multiplied by each term in the second part, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for various \\(k\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually be the sum of all the coefficients from the second polynomial, each multiplied by 6. But that can't be right because the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would include all the \\(c\\) terms. Wait, no, that's not correct. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would actually be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire second polynomial. But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), not a constant. But the problem is asking for a coefficient, which implies a constant. So, perhaps I misunderstood the problem. Maybe it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, meaning that we're looking for the sum of all coefficients where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present, irrespective of the \\(c\\) exponents. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, which would include all possible \\(c\\) terms, but that would make the coefficient a polynomial, not a single number. Hmm, this is confusing. Let me read the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, it's asking for the coefficient of the term \\(a^2b^2\\), which would have any power of \\(c\\) attached. But that doesn't make sense because the coefficient is typically a scalar, not a polynomial. So, maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the constant term with respect to \\(c\\). That would make sense because then the coefficient would be a number. So, assuming that, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) would be 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the second part), giving 120. Alternatively, if the problem is indeed asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), then the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial, not a scalar. But that seems unlikely because the problem is asking for a coefficient, which is usually a number. Therefore, I think the intended interpretation is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is written in a way that it's considering the entire expression as a polynomial in \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\), and it's asking for the coefficient of the monomial \\(a^2b^2\\), which would include all terms where \\(a\\) is squared and \\(b\\) is squared, regardless of the power of \\(c\\). But in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial.

    "text": " So, maybe the terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) don't affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, that doesn't seem right. Because when you multiply two expressions together, each term in the first expression multiplies each term in the second expression. So, if I have \\((a + b)^4\\) times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), then each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But the problem is asking specifically for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, perhaps I need to consider the product and find the term where the variables \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are squared, and then the terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) can be anything, but I'm only interested in the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of what's happening with \\(c\\). Alternatively, maybe I can consider that the terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) will contribute a factor that is multiplied by the \\(a^2b^2\\) term, but since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), perhaps I can just take the coefficient from the first part and multiply it by the entire expansion of the second part. Wait, that might not be correct. Let me think again. When you have two products, say \\(P(a, b) \\times Q(c)\\), then the coefficient of a specific term in \\(P\\) multiplied by the entire \\(Q\\) would just be the coefficient in \\(P\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(Q\\). But in this case, \\(Q\\) is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a Laurent polynomial. So, maybe I need to find the sum of the coefficients of all terms in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because when I multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), each term in \\(Q\\) will contribute a coefficient that gets multiplied by the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(P\\). Wait, but that might not be the right approach. Let me clarify: When you have two polynomials multiplied together, the coefficient of a specific term is the sum of the products of coefficients from each polynomial whose exponents add up to the desired term. But in this case, the first polynomial is in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the second is in \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). Since the variables are different, the exponents don't interfere. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term will contribute a multiple of \\(a^2b^2\\), and their coefficients will add up. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) times the sum of the coefficients of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, first, let me compute \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\), which is 6, as I found earlier. Now, I need to find the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The sum of the coefficients of a polynomial is found by substituting 1 for all variables. So, if I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = (1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 64. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). Wait, but let me double-check that logic. Because when I set \\(c = 1\\), I'm effectively summing all the coefficients in the second polynomial. Since the first polynomial's term \\(a^2b^2\\) is being multiplied by each term in the second polynomial, each with their own coefficients, the total coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) across all terms would indeed be the product of the coefficient from the first polynomial and the sum of coefficients from the second. So, yes, 6 times 64 is 384. Therefore, the coefficient is 384. Alternatively, maybe I can approach this differently. Let me try expanding both parts separately and then see how they multiply. So, \\((a + b)^4\\) expanded is \\(a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, as before. Now, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) can be expanded using the binomial theorem as well. Each term will be \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - k}\\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, the terms are from \\(k = 0\\) to \\(k = 6\\), with exponents \\(6, 4, 2, 0, -2, -4, -6\\). The coefficients are \\(\\dbinom{6}{0}=1\\), \\(\\dbinom{6}{1}=6\\), \\(\\dbinom{6}{2}=15\\), \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}=20\\), \\(\\dbinom{6}{4}=15\\), \\(\\dbinom{6}{5}=6\\), \\(\\dbinom{6}{6}=1\\). So, the sum of these coefficients is \\(1 + 6 + 15 + 20 + 15 + 6 + 1 = 64\\), which matches what I found earlier by substituting \\(c = 1\\). Therefore, the sum of the coefficients is indeed 64. So, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial will be multiplied by each term in the second polynomial, each contributing their own coefficient. Therefore, the total coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times 64, which is 384. Alternatively, if I think about the entire product, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is being multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 6 times 64, so 384. I think that makes sense. Let me see if there's another way to approach this, just to confirm. Suppose I consider the entire expansion of both polynomials. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), as the second part doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\). So, when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each of those terms will contribute a coefficient that gets multiplied by 6, and then all those contributions add up to give the total coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. So, yes, that would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 64, giving 384. I think that's correct. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 384.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{384}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem and properties of polynomial multiplication.\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\):\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\n   \\]\n   So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\n2. **Sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   The sum of the coefficients of a polynomial is found by substituting \\(c = 1\\):\n   \\[\n   \\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\n   \\]\n\n3. **Combine the results:**\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is the product of the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) and the sum of the coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 64 = 384\n   \\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{384}\\)."

Because \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are in one part, and \\(c\\) is in the other part, they don't interfere with each other. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that can't be right because then it would be an expression involving \\(c\\) terms. Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, I think it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in other words, when you multiply out the entire expression, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by various terms from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), and the coefficient would be the sum of all those products. But that seems complicated. Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Perhaps the question is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, so the coefficient would include terms from the \\(c\\) expansion. But that doesn't make much sense because the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), so maybe the coefficient is just the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But that seems odd. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\), which is 1. That would make sense because then the coefficient would be a constant, not involving \\(c\\). So, maybe that's what the problem is asking for. Let me try that approach. So, first, find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which we already found to be 6. Then, we need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because when we multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), we want the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so that the overall term is \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, now I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let's expand that using the binomial theorem as well. So, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). So, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Wait, does that make sense? Let me double-check. So, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. In \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. So, when you multiply these two expansions together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, we need to consider that \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by all the terms from the second expansion, but the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would include all the terms multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, no, actually, no. Wait, if you think of the entire product as a polynomial in \\(a, b, c\\), then \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be \\(6 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that's not a constant; it's a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), so perhaps it's expecting just the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that seems odd because the answer would then involve \\(c\\) terms. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be 6 multiplied by 20, giving 120. That seems more likely because then it's a constant coefficient.

Wait, but actually, the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, maybe the entire expression's expansion will have terms where each term is a product of a term from \\((a + b)^4\\) and a term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).

Wait, no, that's not correct. Let me think again. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When you expand this, each term will be of the form \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}a^{4 - k}b^k \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - m}\\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\), which simplifies to \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}\\dbinom{6}{m}a^{4 - k}b^k c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would come from when \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\), as we determined earlier, and for any \\(m\\) such that the exponent of \\(c\\) is whatever. But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the exponent of \\(c\\), we can sum over all possible \\(m\\). So, the coefficient would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) times the sum over all \\(m\\) of \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\). Wait, but that can't be right because the sum of \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\) for \\(m = 0\\) to \\(6\\) is \\(2^6 = 64\\). So, then the coefficient would be \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). But that seems high. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me try a different approach. Since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, perhaps we can treat \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) as a single term when considering the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, as we found earlier. Then, when we multiply by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial in \\(c\\), the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But the sum of the coefficients in a polynomial is found by substituting \\(c = 1\\). So, \\(\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 \u00d7 64 = 384. Wait, but that seems too straightforward, and I'm not sure if that's correct. Let me check again. Alternatively, maybe the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion of the entire expression, treating \\(c\\) as another variable. So, each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the term in \\((a + b)^4\\) which is \\(6a^2b^2\\) and is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).

So, when expanding, each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are different variables from \\(c\\), the only way \\(a^2b^2\\) can appear in the product is if we take the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from \\((a + b)^4\\) and multiply it by the constant term (i.e., \\(c^0\\)) from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Now, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me expand that using the binomial theorem as well. \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be 0, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Let me compute that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Therefore, going back to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake. So, \\((a + b)^4\\) gives 6 for \\(a^2b^2\\), and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) gives 20 for \\(c^0\\), so when we multiply them together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by 20, resulting in 6 * 20 = 120. That seems correct. Alternatively, maybe I should think of the entire expansion as a product, but since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are different variables, the only cross terms that contribute to \\(a^2b^2\\) are those where the \\(c\\) terms don't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) exponents. So yes, I think 120 is the right answer.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Multiplying these together gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\(\\boxed{120}\\)"

Wait, actually, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the terms involving \\(c\\) will multiply each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\). But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), maybe I can consider that term separately. So, in other words, when I multiply the two expressions, each term from \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I can take the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) which is 6 and then consider the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) as a single term, because I'm only looking for the \\(a^2b^2\\) term, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. Wait, but that might not be correct because when you multiply, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But since I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), maybe I can treat \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) as a constant with respect to \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, that doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would be a numerical coefficient, not involving \\(c\\). So, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Wait, perhaps the problem is actually in a product where \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are variables, and I'm supposed to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), because \\(c\\) is involved in the second part. Hmm, maybe I should consider that. Let me think again. So, the problem is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). But in the product, each term from \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be \\(6 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems to involve \\(c\\), which isn't present in \\(a^2b^2\\). So, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). That is, the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that doesn't make sense because the coefficient should be a number, not an expression involving \\(c\\). Alternatively, maybe the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, but that seems odd because \\(c\\) is in the second part. Wait, perhaps the problem is to consider the entire product and find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times any power of \\(c\\). But that would mean the coefficient is \\(6 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", so maybe it's expecting just the numerical coefficient, treating \\(c\\) as separate. Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try to break it down again.\n\nFirst, expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) has a coefficient of \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n\nNext, the expression \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) can also be expanded using the binomial theorem. Let me write that out: \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\).\n\nSo, each term in this expansion is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\).\n\nNow, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion (with coefficient 6) will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems odd because the problem is asking for a coefficient, which should be a number, not an expression involving \\(c\\). So, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is actually to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating \\(c\\) as another variable. That is, the entire product is a polynomial in \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\), and I need to find the coefficient of the term \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which would make the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) equal to \\(6 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that's a bit strange because it's not a numerical coefficient but a polynomial in \\(c\\). Alternatively, perhaps the problem is to consider the entire product and find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some specific \\(k\\), but the problem doesn't specify \\(k\\). So, maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable, so the coefficient would be \\(6 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems like an unusual way to phrase the problem. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, considering all possible powers of \\(c\\), but that would just be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which isn't a single number. So, maybe I'm missing something here.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. That is, the term where the power of \\(c\\) cancels out. So, in that case, I would need to find the term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. Let me check that. So, in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, to find where the exponent is zero, set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which gives \\(m = 3\\). So, the term where \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product would be \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). So, perhaps that's the answer the problem is looking for.\n\nWait, but the problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", not \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). So, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). In that case, the coefficient would be \\(6 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But that seems odd because the problem is asking for a coefficient, which is typically a number. So, perhaps the problem is intended to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, but that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, not a number. Alternatively, maybe the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when all the \\(c\\) terms are combined, but that's unclear.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider that the problem is simply to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, so the coefficient would be \\(6 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems unlikely because it's not a numerical coefficient. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be 120, as I calculated earlier.\n\nWait, maybe I should check the problem again. It says: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, it's possible that the problem is considering the entire product and wants the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, not a single number. That doesn't seem right. Alternatively, maybe the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable, so the coefficient is \\(6 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).

But that seems unusual because the problem is asking for a coefficient, which is typically a number. So, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it, and the problem is simply to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then recognize that the \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) part doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. But that doesn't seem right because when you multiply, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by each term in the \\(c\\) expansion, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But again, that's a polynomial in \\(c\\), not a number. So, maybe the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, meaning that the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion, but that seems odd.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, considering that \\(c\\) can take any value, so the coefficient is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't make sense because the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) would be when \\(c = 1\\), which is \\(2^6 = 64\\). So, 6 times 64 is 384. But that seems like a stretch because the problem isn't asking for the sum of coefficients.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it, and the problem is simply to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and the \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) part is just another factor, so the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But again, that's a polynomial, not a number. So, perhaps the problem is intended to have the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which would mean 6 times the entire expansion, but that's not a number.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, so the coefficient is \\(6 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).

So, perhaps the problem is actually to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is obtained by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\(2^6 = 64\\). So, 6 times 64 is 384. But that seems like a different question, and the problem isn't asking for that.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is simply to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and the rest is a distraction. But that seems unlikely because the problem includes the \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) term.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is to consider that the entire product is a single polynomial, and I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms.

But that seems like the coefficient is a polynomial, which doesn't make sense. So, perhaps the problem is intended to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product when expanded, and the answer is 6 times the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that's not a number.\n\nWait, maybe I should look at it differently. Let me consider that when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term from the second part.

But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), without specifying any power of \\(c\\).

The sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is obtained by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\(2^6 = 64\\). So, 6 times 64 is 384.

When expanding, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).

So, perhaps the problem is intended to have \\(c^0\\), and the answer is 120.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of \\(c\\), which would be 6 times the entire expansion, but that's a polynomial.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider that the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating \\(c\\) as a variable, so the coefficient is a polynomial, but the problem is asking for a number, so maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, considering that \\(c\\) is another variable, so the coefficient is \\(6 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).

    "text": " So, perhaps the terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) don't affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)? Wait, no, that doesn't make sense. Because when you multiply two expressions together, each term from the first expression gets multiplied by each term from the second expression. So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I need to consider how many times \\(a^2b^2\\) appears when multiplied by the terms from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, actually, \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term in \\((a + b)^4\\), and when multiplied by terms from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the expansion would be \\(a^2b^2 \\times \\left(\\text{something with }c\\right)\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, I think the coefficient would just be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, no, that's not quite right. Because when you multiply two expressions, the coefficients multiply as well. But in this case, since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) can only come from the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by any term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is multiplied by the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. So, first, let me find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which I already found to be 6. Now, I need to find the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). How do I find the sum of all coefficients in a polynomial? I think it's done by plugging in 1 for all variables. So, if I substitute \\(c = 1\\) into \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), I should get the sum of all coefficients. Let me compute that: \\(\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = (2)^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 (from \\((a + b)^4\\)) multiplied by 64 (from the sum of coefficients in the other part), which is 6 * 64 = 384. Wait, that seems too straightforward. Let me make sure I'm not missing anything. Alternatively, perhaps the question is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, without considering the \\(c\\) terms, which would mean that the \\(c\\) terms are just along for the ride, so to speak. So, when you multiply the two expressions, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is a monomial, say \\(c^k\\) or \\(c^{-k}\\), when you multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), you get terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2c^{-k}\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, in other words, if you were to collect like terms, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the sum of all coefficients from the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) multiplied by 6. So, that's why I calculated the sum of coefficients by plugging in \\(c = 1\\), which gave me 64, and then multiplied by 6 to get 384. Hmm, that seems correct, but let me double-check. Alternatively, maybe the question is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion of the entire expression, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, meaning that it's the product of the coefficients. Wait, but that's not quite right because the \\(c\\) terms are separate. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 (from \\((a + b)^4\\)) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, if the problem had asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some specific \\(k\\), then we would need to calculate it differently, but since it's just \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\), the coefficient would be 6 * 64 = 384. Let me check another way. Suppose I expand both expressions separately and then multiply. So, \\((a + b)^4\\) has terms from \\(a^4\\) down to \\(b^4\\), and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) has terms from \\(c^6\\) down to \\(c^{-6}\\). When you multiply them together, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion will be multiplied by every term in the second expansion, which includes \\(c^6, 6c^5, 15c^4, 20c^3, 15c^2, 6c, 1, 6/c, 15/c^2, 20/c^3, 15/c^4, 6/c^5, 1/c^6\\). The coefficients of these terms are 1, 6, 15, 20, 15, 6, 1, 6, 15, 20, 15, 6, 1 respectively. So, the sum of these coefficients is indeed 1 + 6 + 15 + 20 + 15 + 6 + 1 + 6 + 15 + 20 + 15 + 6 + 1. Let me add them up step by step: 1 + 6 = 7; 7 + 15 = 22; 22 + 20 = 42; 42 + 15 = 57; 57 + 6 = 63; 63 + 1 = 64; then 64 + 6 = 70; 70 + 15 = 85; 85 + 20 = 105; 105 + 15 = 120; 120 + 6 = 126; 126 + 1 = 127. Wait, that doesn't match my previous calculation of 64. Hmm, that's a problem. Wait, I think I made a mistake in adding. Let me try again. The coefficients are: 1, 6, 15, 20, 15, 6, 1, 6, 15, 20, 15, 6, 1. Let me group them to make adding easier. Let's pair them from the start and end:\n\n1 + 1 = 2\n\n6 + 6 = 12\n\n15 + 15 = 30\n\n20 + 20 = 40\n\n15 + 15 = 30\n\n6 + 6 = 12\n\n1 + 1 = 2\n\nWait, but that's only 7 pairs, but there are 13 terms. Wait, no, actually, the middle term is 1, so it's 1, 6, 15, 20, 15, 6, 1, 6, 15, 20, 15, 6, 1. Wait, actually, no, the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) should have terms from \\(c^6\\) down to \\(c^{-6}\\), so there are 13 terms. The coefficients are symmetric, so the coefficients are 1, 6, 15, 20, 15, 6, 1, 6, 15, 20, 15, 6, 1. Wait, that can't be right because the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem would have coefficients: \\(\\dbinom{6}{0}=1\\), \\(\\dbinom{6}{1}=6\\), \\(\\dbinom{6}{2}=15\\), \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}=20\\), then \\(\\dbinom{6}{4}=15\\), \\(\\dbinom{6}{5}=6\\), \\(\\dbinom{6}{6}=1\\). So, the coefficients are 1, 6, 15, 20, 15, 6, 1. That's 7 terms, from \\(c^6\\) to \\(c^{-6}\\). Wait, so I think I made a mistake earlier by listing 13 coefficients. Actually, it's 7 terms: \\(c^6\\), \\(6c^5\\), \\(15c^4\\), \\(20c^3\\), \\(15c^2\\), \\(6c\\), \\(1\\), and then the terms with negative exponents would be \\(6/c\\), \\(15/c^2\\), \\(20/c^3\\), \\(15/c^4\\), \\(6/c^5\\), \\(1/c^6\\). Wait, but no, that's not correct. Actually, the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, for k=0: c^6, coefficient 1.\n\nk=1: 6c^{4}, coefficient 6.\n\nk=2: 15c^{2}, coefficient 15.\n\nk=3: 20c^{0} = 20, coefficient 20.\n\nk=4: 15c^{-2}, coefficient 15.\n\nk=5: 6c^{-4}, coefficient 6.\n\nk=6: c^{-6}, coefficient 1.\n\nSo, the coefficients are 1, 6, 15, 20, 15, 6, 1. So, only 7 terms, not 13. So, when I sum them up, it's 1 + 6 + 15 + 20 + 15 + 6 + 1. Let me calculate that:\n\n1 + 6 = 7\n\n7 + 15 = 22\n\n22 + 20 = 42\n\n42 + 15 = 57\n\n57 + 6 = 63\n\n63 + 1 = 64\n\nSo, the sum of the coefficients is indeed 64. That matches my earlier calculation. So, the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 64, which is 384. So, I think that's the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is found by first determining the coefficient in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Then, the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by substituting \\(c = 1\\), resulting in \\(2^6 = 64\\). Multiplying these together gives \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n\\boxed{384}"

    "text": " So, maybe I don't need to consider the other parts of the expansion? Or do I? Wait, no, because when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second. But in this case, the first part is \\((a + b)^4\\) and the second is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the variables are different: \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) vs. \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, when I multiply them, the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) won't interact with those involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression will just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a specific term. Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me think again. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, when you expand both, you'll get terms like \\(a^kb^{4 - k}\\) from the first part and terms like \\(c^m (1/c)^{6 - m}\\) from the second part. But since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\), and \\(1/c\\) are different variables, their exponents won't affect each other. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that's not a numerical coefficient; it's a polynomial. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which suggests that we're treating \\(c\\) as another variable, and we need to consider the entire expression. Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\).\" So, perhaps they are treating \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) as separate terms, but since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are in the first part, and \\(c\\) is in the second, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the entire second part, which is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would make the coefficient a polynomial in \\(c\\), not a constant. But maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. Wait, no, that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, considering all variables. But that seems unlikely because \\(c\\) is a different variable. Alternatively, maybe the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating \\(c\\) as a variable, so the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\). But that seems more complicated. Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me think again. The problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 (c + 1/c)^6\\). So, in the product, each term from \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term from \\((c + 1/c)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\), and it's multiplied by every term from \\((c + 1/c)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\((c + 1/c)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is 6 times \\((c + 1/c)^6\\), which is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for a coefficient, which is usually a number. So, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable, so the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients of each term in \\((c + 1/c)^6\\). Wait, no, that's not right. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only considering the coefficients of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, but that seems unclear. Wait, maybe I'm misinterpreting the problem. Let me check the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 (c + 1/c)^6\\).\" So, in the product, \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term, and the coefficient would be the product of the coefficients from each part. Since \\((a + b)^4\\) gives \\(a^2b^2\\) with coefficient 6, and \\((c + 1/c)^6\\) is being multiplied by it, but \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) are separate variables. So, perhaps the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the entire expansion of \\((c + 1/c)^6\\). But that doesn't make sense because the coefficient should be a number, not a polynomial. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by the constant term in \\((c + 1/c)^6\\), which would be the coefficient when the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out, i.e., when \\(m = 3\\), because \\(c^m (1/c)^{6 - m} = c^{2m - 6}\\). So, to get a constant term, we set \\(2m - 6 = 0\\), which gives \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term in \\((c + 1/c)^6\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times 20, which is 120. Wait, that makes sense because when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\((c + 1/c)^6\\), the only way to get a term that is purely \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms is to multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by the constant term in \\((c + 1/c)^6\\). So, the coefficient would be 6 times 20, which is 120. Let me check that again. So, in \\((c + 1/c)^6\\), the constant term is when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. So, using the binomial theorem, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} (1/c)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, when we multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part (which has coefficient 6) by the constant term 20 from the second part, we get 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 120. That seems to make sense. Alternatively, if we consider that the entire coefficient is 6 times the expansion of \\((c + 1/c)^6\\), but that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, which doesn't seem right because the problem is asking for a specific coefficient, which should be a number. So, I think the correct approach is to consider that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 multiplied by the constant term in \\((c + 1/c)^6\\), which is 20, giving 120. So, I think the answer is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Multiplying these gives 6 * 20 = 120.\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\boxed{120}."

    "text": " So, does that mean the \\(c\\) terms don't matter? Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Wait, no, actually, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when I expand both, each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I might not need to consider the \\(c\\) terms at all. Wait, that doesn't make sense because when you multiply, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term would come from the \\((a + b)^4\\) part, and the other part would involve \\(c\\) terms, but maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient in the entire product, but only focusing on the \\(a^2b^2\\) part regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. Wait, but that might not be the case. Maybe the problem is considering the entire expression, so I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by any term from the \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) expansion. But then, the coefficient would involve both parts. Hmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, I think it's asking for the coefficient of the term that has \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by any combination of \\(c\\) terms. But actually, no, because \\(a^2b^2\\) is in the first part, and the second part is separate. So, maybe the \\(c\\) terms don't affect the \\(a^2b^2\\) term, so the coefficient would just be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of the second part. But that doesn't make sense because then the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\), not a single number. Wait, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), meaning the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. Because otherwise, the coefficient would involve terms with \\(c\\). So, perhaps I need to consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) and find the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, so that when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), it remains as \\(a^2b^2\\). Let me think. So, the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) can be written using the binomial theorem as \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the exponent of \\(c\\) in each term is \\(6 - 2m\\). We want the term where the exponent is zero, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which gives \\(m = 3\\). So, the term where \\(m = 3\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} c^{0} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Now, going back to the original expression: \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When we expand this, each term from \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which comes from \\((a + b)^4\\) with coefficient 6, and we need to multiply it by the term from the second expansion that has \\(c^0\\), which is 20. So, the total coefficient would be 6 * 20 = 120. Wait, but let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. Alternatively, maybe the problem is considering the entire expression and just wants the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, but that would mean that the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense. So, perhaps the problem is implicitly asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\). That would make sense, as then the coefficient would be a number. So, that would be 6 (from \\(a^2b^2\\)) multiplied by 20 (from \\(c^0\\)), giving 120. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating, and the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable, so the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, which doesn't seem right. So, I think the correct approach is to consider the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\), giving a coefficient of 120. Let me double-check my steps. First, expand \\((a + b)^4\\) and find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is 6. Then, expand \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) and find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\), which is 20. Multiply them together to get 120. That seems correct. Alternatively, if I were to compute the entire product, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), so the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by all the terms from the second expansion, but if we're just looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, that would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which would mean the coefficient is a polynomial. But I think the problem is more likely asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. Yeah, I think that's the right approach.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is found by considering the relevant terms from each binomial expansion. \n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\)**:\n   - The term \\(a^2b^2\\) has a coefficient of \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n\n2. **Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)**:\n   - Find the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, which occurs when \\(6 - 2m = 0 \\Rightarrow m = 3\\).\n   - The coefficient for this term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n\n3. **Multiply the coefficients**:\n   - \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer**: The coefficient is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

    "text": " So, maybe I don't need to worry about the terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) because they won't affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, let me think again. When you multiply two expressions together, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression. So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), that term comes only from the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the constant term (if any) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, is that correct? Because if I'm only interested in \\(a^2b^2\\), then any other variables multiplied into it would change the term. But in this case, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the other variables. Hmm, actually, I think I might have made a mistake there. Let me clarify: The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when I expand this, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so I need to find all the terms in the expansion where the variables \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are squared, regardless of the power of \\(c\\). Wait, no, that's not quite right. Actually, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by some term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which could be \\(c^k\\) or \\(c^{-k}\\), but since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), perhaps we need to consider that any term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) that is a constant (i.e., where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero) would multiply \\(a^2b^2\\), contributing to its coefficient. Alternatively, maybe the problem is considering the entire expression and wants the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning that we're only interested in the term where \\(a\\) is squared, \\(b\\) is squared, and \\(c\\) is to the zero power. That makes more sense. So, in that case, I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, let me proceed step by step. First, as I found earlier, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. Now, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me expand that using the binomial theorem as well. So, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying that, each term becomes \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m} = \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We want the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, so we set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Now, since the original expression is the product of \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second part. But we're only interested in the term where \\(c^0\\) is involved, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficients from each part. That is, 6 (from \\(a^2b^2\\)) multiplied by 20 (from \\(c^0\\)). So, 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120. Wait, let me just double-check that. So, in \\((a + b)^4\\), \\(a^2b^2\\) has a coefficient of 6. In \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the constant term (where \\(c^0\\)) has a coefficient of 20. When you multiply these two parts together, each term from the first is multiplied by each term from the second. So, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, but only the constant term will result in a term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present without any \\(c\\) terms. Therefore, the coefficient is indeed 6 * 20 = 120. So, I think that's the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break down the problem into two parts using the binomial theorem.\n\n1. **Expanding \\((a + b)^4\\):**\n   Using the binomial theorem, the expansion is:\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term with \\(a^2b^2\\) occurs when \\(k = 2\\), giving:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\n   \\]\n   So, the coefficient is 6.\n\n2. **Expanding \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   The expansion is:\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n   \\]\n   We seek the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0:\n   \\[\n   6 - 2m = 0 \\implies m = 3\n   \\]\n   The coefficient is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\n   \\]\n\n3. **Combining the results:**\n   The term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion is multiplied by the constant term from the second expansion:\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 20 = 120\n   \\]\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."
