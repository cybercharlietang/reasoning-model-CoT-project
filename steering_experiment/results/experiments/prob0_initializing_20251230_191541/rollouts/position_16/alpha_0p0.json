    "text": " So, maybe I don't need to worry about the \\(c\\) terms when looking for \\(a^2b^2\\), unless... Hmm, wait, no, actually, the entire expression is the product of the two binomials. So, when I expand both, I'll have terms from both expansions multiplied together. But since I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I need to see if there are any terms in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) that affect this. Wait, but \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), so perhaps the coefficient in front of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't make sense because when you multiply two expressions, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, if I'm looking for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, it would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the sum of all terms in the second part. But wait, no, that's not quite right. Because the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), when expanded, has terms with different powers of \\(c\\). So, when you multiply, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) gets multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\). Wait, no, that's not correct because when you multiply, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from \\((a + b)^4\\) would be multiplied by every term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that can't be right because the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) would be when \\(c = 1\\). So, substituting \\(c = 1\\), \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). So, does that mean the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times 64, which is 384? Hmm, that seems too straightforward, and I'm not sure if I'm thinking correctly.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try another approach. The problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), it means that when we multiply the two expressions, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by every term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, as I thought earlier, the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\(2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 (from \\((a + b)^4\\)) multiplied by 64, which is 384. But wait, that seems too large, and I might be making a mistake here.\n\nWait another thought: perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, which would include all possible terms from both parts. But since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are only in the first part, and \\(c\\) is only in the second part, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term doesn't involve \\(c\\), so when you multiply, the coefficient would indeed be the product of the coefficients from each part. So, 6 times 64 is 384. But let me check this again.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider that the entire product is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, when expanded, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which includes terms like \\(c^6\\), \\(6c^4\\), \\(15c^2\\), \\(20\\), \\(15/c^2\\), \\(6/c^4\\), and \\(1/c^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be \\(6 \\times (1 + 6 + 15 + 20 + 15 + 6 + 1)\\). Wait, but that sum is \\(1 + 6 + 15 + 20 + 15 + 6 + 1 = 64\\), which is the same as before. So, 6 times 64 is 384. Therefore, the coefficient is 384.\n\nBut wait, maybe I'm wrong because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), so in the product, \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which means the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is indeed 6 times the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 64, so 6*64=384.\n\nWait, but let me make sure. Let's consider that when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in one polynomial is multiplied by all coefficients in the other polynomial, and then those products are summed. So, in this case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 64, so the total coefficient is 6*64=384.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should think about it differently. Let me compute \\((a + b)^4\\) first. As I did before, the expansion is \\(a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. Now, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) can be expanded using the binomial theorem as well. The expansion is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\times (1/c)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, each term in this expansion is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\) for \\(k = 0\\) to \\(6\\). Now, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from \\((a + b)^4\\) (which has coefficient 6) will be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is indeed 64, as calculated earlier. So, 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me check if that's correct. Because when I multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the resulting terms will be \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(6a^2b^2c^4\\), \\(15a^2b^2c^2\\), \\(20a^2b^2\\), \\(15a^2b^2/c^2\\), \\(6a^2b^2/c^4\\), and \\(a^2b^2/c^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is only the constant term, which is \\(20a^2b^2\\). Wait, no! Wait, that's a mistake. Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) itself is multiplied by each of those terms, but the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2 and 2, respectively, but without any \\(c\\) terms. So, in the product, the only term that would contribute to \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms is when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. So, that would be when \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which implies \\(k = 3\\). So, the coefficient of the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) (which is 6) multiplied by the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) (which is 20). So, 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, now I'm confused because earlier I thought it was 384, but now I'm getting 120. Which one is correct?\n\nLet me clarify. The problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, when you multiply these two expressions, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(6a^2b^2c^4\\), etc. However, the problem is asking specifically for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2 each, and the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. Therefore, the only term that contributes to \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) is when the \\(a^2b^2\\) term is multiplied by the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 20. Therefore, the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, so earlier I thought it was 384, but that was a mistake because I was considering all terms, but actually, the problem is only interested in the term where \\(c\\) is zero, i.e., the constant term. So, the correct coefficient is 120.\n\nLet me verify this again. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is:\n\n\\[\n\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n\\]\n\nSo, the terms are:\n\n- \\(k=0\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{0}c^{6} = 1 \\times c^6\\)\n- \\(k=1\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{1}c^{4} = 6c^4\\)\n- \\(k=2\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{2}c^{2} = 15c^2\\)\n- \\(k=3\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}c^{0} = 20\\)\n- \\(k=4\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{4}c^{-2} = 15c^{-2}\\)\n- \\(k=5\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{5}c^{-4} = 6c^{-4}\\)\n- \\(k=6\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{6}c^{-6} = 1c^{-6}\\)\n\nSo, the constant term is 20. Therefore, when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in this expansion, only the term with \\(c^0\\) (i.e., 20) will result in a term with \\(a^2b^2\\). All other terms will have some power of \\(c\\), so they won't contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient is indeed 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nI think I made a mistake earlier by considering the sum of all coefficients, which would give the total when \\(c = 1\\), but that's not what the problem is asking. The problem specifically wants the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which requires the term from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) to be the constant term, so that when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), it remains \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms.\n\nSo, to summarize:\n\n1. Find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6.\n2. Find the constant term (coefficient of \\(c^0\\)) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 20.\n3. Multiply these two coefficients together: 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is 120.\n\nWait, but let me check this once more to be sure. Suppose I compute the product \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\) as 6a^2b^2. When this is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), it becomes 6a^2b^2 \\times \\left(c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15/c^2 + 6/c^4 + 1/c^6\\right). So, the only term that doesn't involve \\(c\\) is 6a^2b^2 * 20, which is 120a^2b^2. Therefore, the coefficient is 120.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So, the correct answer is 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break down the problem into two parts: expanding \\((a + b)^4\\) and considering the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\n1. **Expanding \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\), so the coefficient is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\n   \\]\n\n2. **Expanding \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n   \\]\n   We need the constant term (where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero), which occurs when \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), i.e., \\(k = 3\\). The coefficient is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\n   \\]\n\n3. **Combining the results:**\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the product of the coefficients from each expansion:\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 20 = 120\n   \\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

    "text": " That makes me think that maybe the terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) don't affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, perhaps I only need to consider the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) and then multiply it by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but since we're looking for a specific term in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), maybe the \\(c\\) terms just contribute a factor that we can consider separately. Wait, but actually, when you multiply two polynomials, each term from the first polynomial gets multiplied by each term from the second polynomial.

But that seems a bit off because the \\(c\\) terms would still be part of the product. Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me clarify: The problem asks for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but it's in the product of two expressions, each involving different variables. So, when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expression is multiplied by every term in the second expression, which are of the form \\(c^k\\) or \\(c^{-k}\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second polynomial, each term contributes its own coefficient, and since we're just looking for \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, we have to sum all those contributions. Wait, but that can't be right because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would include all possible powers of \\(c\\). But in reality, \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), so the coefficient would actually be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that's not correct because the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), so \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). So, then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times 64, which is 384. But that seems too large, and I'm not sure if that's the correct approach. Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)\". So, the entire expression is a product of two polynomials, one in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the other in \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, when you multiply them, the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are multiplied by the terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). But the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term that's present in \\((a + b)^4\\) and when you multiply it by each term in the second polynomial, each of those products would contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times some power of \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but in the entire product, \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by all possible powers of \\(c\\). So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because when you expand the product, each term is \\(a^2b^2 \\times c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2 \\times c^{-k}\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) across all powers of \\(c\\) would be the coefficient from the first part times the sum of coefficients from the second part. But wait, no, actually, the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would be the sum of all coefficients of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for any \\(k\\). So, that would indeed be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by substituting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 * 64 = 384. But wait, that seems too straightforward. Let me check if I'm missing something. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think differently: The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the \\(a^2b^2\\) term comes only from the product of the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in \\((a + b)^4\\) and the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, in other words, the coefficient is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384. So, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe I should consider that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which would mean that the coefficient is indeed 6 times 64, which is 384. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only considering terms where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out, but that's not specified, so I think the correct interpretation is that we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. Therefore, the coefficient would be 6 * 64 = 384. Wait, but let me make sure. Let me think about how the product works. When you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by every term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which are terms like \\(c^6\\), \\(6c^4\\), \\(15c^2\\), \\(20\\), \\(15c^{-2}\\), \\(6c^{-4}\\), \\(c^{-6}\\). So, when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each of these, you get terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(6a^2b^2c^4\\), etc. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the sum of all these coefficients, which is the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Since the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 64, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 * 64 = 384. Therefore, the answer should be 384. But wait, let me check if that's correct. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out. In that case, we would need to find the term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) that has \\(c^0\\), which is the constant term. So, let me calculate that. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). The term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero is when \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it's 6 * 20 = 120. But the problem just says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", without specifying any \\(c\\) terms. So, I'm confused now. Does it mean the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), which would be 384, or the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120? Hmm. Let me look at the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)\". It doesn't specify any condition on \\(c\\), so I think it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). Therefore, that would be 6 * 64 = 384. But to be thorough, let me consider both interpretations. If it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times any power of \\(c\\), then it's 384. If it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it's 120. Since the problem didn't specify, I think the first interpretation is correct, so the answer is 384. But to make sure, let me think about how the problem is phrased. It says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", which typically means the coefficient when considering all possible powers of the other variables. So, in this case, since \\(c\\) is another variable, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would include all terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any power of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient is indeed 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, if the problem had said \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\)\", then it would be 120. But since it's just \\(a^2b^2\\), I think it's 384. Wait, but let me think again. When you have a product of two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in one set of variables is the sum of the products of the coefficients of that term in the first polynomial and all terms in the second polynomial. So, in this case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Since the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 64, the coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384. Therefore, the answer is 384. Wait, but let me check with an example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^1 \\times (c + 1/c)^1 = (a + b)(c + 1/c) = ac + a/c + bc + b/c\\). The coefficient of \\(a\\) would be \\(c + 1/c\\), but if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a\\) regardless of \\(c\\), that would be the sum of the coefficients, which is \\(1 + 1 = 2\\). So, in this case, the coefficient of \\(a\\) is 2 times the sum of coefficients in \\((c + 1/c)^1\\), which is 2. But in reality, when you multiply out, the coefficient of \\(a\\) is \\(c + 1/c\\), which is a polynomial in \\(c\\), not a scalar. So, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. Actually, in the example, the coefficient of \\(a\\) is \\(c + 1/c\\), which is a term that depends on \\(c\\). So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a\\) regardless of \\(c\\), it's actually the sum of the coefficients when considering all powers of \\(c\\). So, in that case, it would be 2, as before. So, applying that logic, in the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384. Therefore, I think that's the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is found using the binomial theorem, which gives \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). The entire expression also includes \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). To find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, we multiply the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The sum of coefficients is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), resulting in \\(2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{384}\\)."

Alternatively, maybe I need to consider the entire product, but since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't have any \\(c\\) terms, perhaps the coefficient is just the coefficient from the first part, which is 6. Wait, but that seems too straightforward. Let me think again. When you multiply two expressions together, the coefficients multiply as well. But in this case, I'm looking for a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), so maybe the other part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), must contribute a term that is \\(c^0\\) because \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't have any \\(c\\) terms. So, perhaps I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) and then multiply it by the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6. That makes sense because when you multiply the two expansions, only the terms where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out (i.e., \\(c^0\\)) will contribute to the term without \\(c\\), which is \\(a^2b^2\\). So, let me work on finding the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Again, using the binomial theorem, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying each term, that becomes \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m} = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). Now, I need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be 0, so I set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\) so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part is 20. Now, since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which comes from the first part, and we're also considering the \\(c^0\\) term from the second part, the overall coefficient would be the product of these two coefficients. So, 6 (from \\(a^2b^2\\)) multiplied by 20 (from \\(c^0\\)) equals 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120. Wait, let me double-check that. So, when I expand \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6. Then, in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. When you multiply these two expansions together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will multiply with the \\(c^0\\) term from the second part, so their coefficients multiply as well. So, 6 * 20 = 120. That seems right. I don't think I made any mistakes here.

But that seems complicated. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the powers of \\(c\\), so it's just 6. But that feels too simple. Let me check the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)\". So, the expression is a product of two polynomials, one in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the other in \\(c\\). So, when you multiply them, the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from those involving \\(c\\).

Using the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\).

Now, when I multiply this by \\((a + b)^4\\), which has a term \\(6a^2b^2\\), the product will have terms like \\(6a^2b^2 \\times \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, each term in the product will be \\(6 \\times \\dbinom{6}{m} a^2b^2 c^{6 - 2m}\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 times the sum of all the coefficients from the \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) expansion, but wait, no, because each term is multiplied by 6, but we're only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).

So, when we expand this, each term in the expansion will be a product of a term from \\((a + b)^4\\) and a term from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), that term will come from the product of the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in \\((a + b)^4\\) and every possible term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term without any \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), does that mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\)? Wait, no, that doesn't seem right because when you multiply two expressions, each term in the first expression is multiplied by each term in the second. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that can't be right because the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) would be when \\(c = 1\\), which is \\(2^6 = 64\\). So, then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). But wait, that seems too straightforward. Let me check if that's correct. Alternatively, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, in that case, the coefficient would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), because each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) contributes a coefficient that multiplies the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. So, yes, that would be 6 times 64, which is 384. But wait, let me make sure. Let me think of it another way. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). If I expand both, the product will have terms like \\(a^kb^{4 - k} \\times c^m\\) or \\(a^kb^{4 - k} \\times c^{-m}\\), where \\(m\\) is some exponent from the second expansion. But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, in other words, all the terms in the product where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2 each, regardless of what the exponents of \\(c\\) are. Therefore, the coefficient would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Because each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) contributes a coefficient that, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), gives a term in the product. Therefore, the total coefficient is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). Wait, but is that correct? Let me think again. Alternatively, perhaps I'm supposed to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning that the exponents of \\(c\\) must cancel out to zero. Because if I'm just looking for \\(a^2b^2\\), that would imply \\(c^0\\), since the problem doesn't specify any \\(c\\) terms. So, maybe I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product. That would make more sense because otherwise, the coefficient would be the sum of all possible \\(c\\) terms multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), which would give a coefficient that's a polynomial in \\(c\\), but the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. So, perhaps I was wrong earlier, and the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the constant term with respect to \\(c\\). So, let me approach it that way. So, I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Therefore, I need to consider the product of the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part and the \\(c^0\\) term from the second part. So, first, from \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, as we found earlier. Now, from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is the middle term when \\(k = 3\\), because \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\times (1/c)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, we need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be zero, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, now, the total coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product is the product of the coefficients from each part, which is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Therefore, the coefficient is 120. Wait, but earlier I thought it was 384, but that was under the assumption that the problem didn't care about the \\(c\\) terms, which might not be the case. Let me check the problem statement again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" Hmm, it just says \\(a^2b^2\\), without any \\(c\\) terms. So, perhaps the problem is indeed asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, meaning that the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\), but I think that's unlikely because usually, when they ask for the coefficient of a term in a product involving multiple variables, they might specify the exponents for all variables. So, maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning that the exponents of \\(c\\) are zero. So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times 20, which is 120. Alternatively, if the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without considering \\(c\\), then it would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which is 6 times 64, which is 384. But that seems a bit odd because the sum of coefficients is when \\(c = 1\\), so maybe that's a different interpretation. Let me think carefully. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). When you multiply these, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion would be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, which are terms like \\(c^6\\), \\(6c^4\\), \\(15c^2\\), \\(20\\), \\(15c^{-2}\\), \\(6c^{-4}\\), \\(c^{-6}\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would have coefficients multiplied by each of these, resulting in terms like \\(6c^6a^2b^2\\), \\(36c^4a^2b^2\\), \\(90c^2a^2b^2\\), \\(120a^2b^2\\), \\(90c^{-2}a^2b^2\\), \\(36c^{-4}a^2b^2\\), \\(6c^{-6}a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms is 120, as we found earlier. If the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), then it's 120. If it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), it's also 120. So, perhaps the problem is indeed asking for 120. Alternatively, if the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, meaning that it's the sum of all coefficients multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), then it would be 6 times 64 = 384. But I think that's not the case because usually, when variables are present, they specify the exponents for all variables. So, I think the correct interpretation is that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. So, I think the answer is 120. Let me just recap to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. From \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). From \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, the total coefficient is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Yes, that seems correct.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we consider the product of the relevant terms from each expansion.\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\):**\n   - The term with \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\\).\n\n2. **Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   - The term with \\(c^0\\) (constant term) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}c^0 = 20\\).\n\n3. **Multiply the coefficients:**\n   - The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), the only way that term can appear is if we take \\(a^2b^2\\) from \\((a + b)^4\\) and multiply it by the term \\(c^0\\) (i.e., the constant term) from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because if we take any other term from the second expression, it would have a \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\) term, which would make the entire term have a \\(c\\) component, but we're only interested in the \\(a^2b^2\\) term, regardless of \\(c\\).

Since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and that term doesn't involve \\(c\\), maybe the entire expression is a product of two polynomials, and the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would come from the product of the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me think about that.

That is, 6 multiplied by 20, which is 120. Wait, but hold on a second. Is that correct? Because I'm multiplying two separate expansions. So, when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from taking \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and any term in the second part. But since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the only term that would contribute is the constant term in the second part. So, the coefficient would indeed be 6 * 20 = 120. Alternatively, maybe I should think of it as the entire expansion. Let me check that again. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, when I expand this, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion.

That would make more sense because otherwise, the coefficient isn't a single number but a polynomial. Let me assume that's the case. So, to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is the same as \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), which is just 1.

Wait, but that doesn't make sense because then the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so maybe I'm misunderstanding. Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think again. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when you expand this, each term will be of the form \\( \\dbinom{4}{k}a^{4 - k}b^k \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - m}\\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m \\). Simplifying the \\(c\\) terms, that becomes \\( \\dbinom{4}{k}\\dbinom{6}{m}a^{4 - k}b^k c^{6 - 2m} \\). Now, the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, I need to find all terms where \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). So, \\(k = 2\\), which we already found, and the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. Then, the other part, \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\), will be multiplied by this. But wait, the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, does that mean that the coefficient is 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)? But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the question is just asking for a numerical coefficient. Hmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" Wait, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). That is, it's treating \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) as separate variables, and it's looking for the coefficient of the term where \\(a\\) is squared and \\(b\\) is squared, and \\(c\\) can be any power. But that doesn't make sense because the coefficient would then be a polynomial in \\(c\\), which is not a single number. Alternatively, maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), that is, the term where \\(a\\) is squared, \\(b\\) is squared, and \\(c\\) is to the zero power, so that the term is \\(a^2b^2\\). But the problem didn't specify \\(c\\), so I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, so it's the sum over all possible \\(c\\) exponents. But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which seems unlikely. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is actually only about the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms, and the \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) part is a separate part that is multiplied, but when considering the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), it's just the product of the coefficients from each part. So, the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the coefficient from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is... Wait, but \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is being multiplied, so for each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), we have a coefficient, and the entire expression would be a product of the two expansions. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), so the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that's not quite right. Because each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) has its own coefficient, so when you multiply, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Wait, but the sum of all coefficients in a polynomial is found by setting all variables to 1. So, if I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(1 + 1/1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 * 64 = 384. But wait, that seems high. Let me check that again. So, \\((a + b)^4\\) gives a term \\(6a^2b^2\\). Then, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) when expanded has terms with coefficients. When you multiply, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Since the sum of coefficients is 64, as calculated by setting \\(c = 1\\), then 6 * 64 = 384. So, the coefficient would be 384. Wait, but I'm not sure if that's correct because the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and in the product, each term would have \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by some power of \\(c\\). So, perhaps the coefficient is actually 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which would make the coefficient a polynomial, but the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, so maybe I'm overcomplicating. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only considering the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) parts and not the \\(c\\) parts, so the coefficient is just 6, but that seems too simple. Alternatively, maybe I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which would involve considering how the terms combine. Wait, let's think differently. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). To find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\), we can consider that the coefficient is the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient would be 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, not a number. So, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), that is, the term where \\(a\\) is squared, \\(b\\) is squared, and \\(c\\) is to the zero power. So, let me try that approach. So, to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), I need to consider the product of the terms from each expansion that result in \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). So, from \\((a + b)^4\\), as before, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. From \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), I need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0. So, let's find the term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0. Using the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(1/c\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, we need the exponent \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which implies \\(m = 3\\). So, the term where \\(m = 3\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}c^{0} = 20\\). So, the coefficient from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) for \\(c^0\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product is 6 * 20 = 120. So, that's the coefficient. Alternatively, if the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, then it's 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which would be 6 times (terms in \\(c\\)), but that would make the coefficient a polynomial, not a number. Since the problem is asking for a coefficient, which is a number, I think the intended interpretation is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. So, I think the answer is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is found by considering the relevant terms from each binomial expansion. \n\n1. From \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n2. From \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term with \\(c^0\\) (i.e., the constant term) is found when \\(m = 3\\), giving \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n3. Multiplying these coefficients together gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

However, since we're only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), maybe we can treat them separately. Let me think again.

Wait, but that can't be right because the problem is asking for the coefficient in the entire product, so maybe I'm supposed to consider that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me think again. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is actually to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where \\(c\\) cancels out, so the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. That would make more sense because otherwise, the coefficient would involve terms with \\(c\\) which are variables, not constants. So, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, considering all possible terms, but only the terms where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out, i.e., \\(c^0\\). That would make sense because otherwise, the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\), but the problem just says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", so maybe it's implied that it's the coefficient when considering all terms, but that would be a sum of terms involving \\(c\\). Alternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, so it's 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that would make the coefficient a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't seem right. Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try to parse the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)\". So, it's asking for the coefficient of the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. But in the product, each term will be of the form \\(a^kb^{4 - k} \\times c^m\\) or something like that. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by some combination of \\(c\\) terms. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so perhaps it's just the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which would be 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial in \\(c\\), but the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, so maybe I'm missing something.

Wait, maybe I'm supposed to consider that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, and the rest is just multiplied by it, but the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is 6. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, treating all variables together, but that seems unlikely. Wait, perhaps I'm misinterpreting the problem. Maybe it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when considering all possible terms, but only where the exponents of \\(c\\) are zero, meaning that the \\(c\\) terms cancel out. That would make more sense because otherwise, the coefficient would involve \\(c\\) terms. So, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\), which is 1. So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, let me try that approach. First, find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Then, multiply that by 6 to get the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is the same as \\(a^2b^2\\). So, how do I find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)? Let's use the binomial theorem again. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We want the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). So, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire expression is 6 (from \\((a + b)^4\\)) multiplied by 20 (from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)), which is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120. Let me just double-check that. So, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. In \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Multiplying them together gives 120. That seems correct. Alternatively, if I didn't consider the \\(c\\) terms and just multiplied 6 by the entire expansion, that would be incorrect because the problem is asking for a specific coefficient, not a polynomial. Therefore, I think the correct approach is to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part and multiply it by the coefficient from the first part, resulting in 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Next, we find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which occurs when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\) giving \\(m = 3\\), and the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying these gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n$\\boxed{120}$"

The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when you multiply these two expansions together, each term from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term from the second expansion. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which comes from \\((a + b)^4\\), and since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the terms from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) will just contribute a factor that's multiplied by the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. Wait, but actually, no. Because when you multiply the two expansions, each term from the first expansion is multiplied by each term from the second expansion. So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), then I need to consider all possible products where the first part is \\(a^2b^2\\) and the second part is any term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, no, that's not correct. Because \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term in the first expansion, and when you multiply it by any term from the second expansion, it will create terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2 \\times \\dfrac{1}{c^k}\\), etc. But the problem is asking specifically for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). That would mean that the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by 1 from the second expansion, right? Because if you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by any term involving \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), it would change the variables. So, actually, to get the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), you only need the term from the second expansion that's equal to 1. Wait, but \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) doesn't have a constant term unless the exponents cancel out. So, let me check: when you expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, the exponent of \\(c\\) is \\(6 - 2k\\). We want the term where the exponent is 0, because that's the term that is 1, so that when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), it remains \\(a^2b^2\\). So, set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(k = 3\\). So, the term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} c^{0} = 20 \\times 1 = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion is 20. Therefore, when we multiply the two expansions together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by 20 from the second part, resulting in \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).

For example, if there was a term in the second expansion that's \\(c^k\\) and a term in the first expansion that's \\(a^2b^2c^{-k}\\), but wait, the first expansion doesn't have any \\(c\\) terms. So, no, the first expansion only has \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), so when multiplied by the second expansion, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second, but the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms is to multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by the constant term from the second expansion, which is 20. So, yes, the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120. So, I think that's the answer. Let me just recap: The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.

Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) has a coefficient, and when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each of those terms, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) will be the sum of all those coefficients multiplied by the original coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\). So, first, I found that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. Now, I need to find the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). How do I find the sum of all coefficients in a polynomial? I remember that the sum of coefficients is found by plugging in 1 for all variables. So, if I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) becomes \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). Wait, but let me double-check that. So, if I have \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), and I want the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is 6 in the first part, and then the sum of coefficients in the second part is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. That seems right. Alternatively, maybe I can think of it as each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) being multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, so 6*64=384. Yeah, that makes sense. So, I think the coefficient is 384.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake. Another way to think about it is that when you have two polynomials multiplied together, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum of the products of the coefficients of terms whose variables multiply to give that specific term. But in this case, since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), the variables in the two polynomials don't interfere. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just the coefficient from the first polynomial times the sum of all coefficients from the second polynomial. So, yeah, that's 6 * 64 = 384. Therefore, I think the answer is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is found using the binomial coefficient \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). The sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is obtained by setting \\(c = 1\\), resulting in \\(2^6 = 64\\). Multiplying these gives \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n\\boxed{384}"

    "text": " So, maybe the part involving \\(c\\) doesn't affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)? Or does it? Hmm, no, actually, when you multiply two expressions together, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), perhaps the \\(c\\) terms can be treated separately. Wait, but actually, the \\(c\\) terms might not affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms at all because they're separate variables. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a specific term, \\(a^2b^2\\), so maybe we can treat the two parts separately and then multiply their coefficients? Wait, no, because when you multiply two expressions, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. But if we're only looking for \\(a^2b^2\\), then the terms involving \\(c\\) would just be coefficients, so they would multiply the entire coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that can't be right because the sum of all coefficients would be when we set \\(c = 1\\), so let me check that. If I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of all coefficients in the second expression is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 * 64 = 384. But wait, that seems too straightforward. Let me think again. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are different variables, the terms involving \\(c\\) don't affect the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). So, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first part will be multiplied by every term in the second part. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, the sum of all coefficients is indeed 64, as I found earlier, so 6 * 64 is 384. But let me check if that's correct. Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to consider that the entire product is a single expression, and I'm only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, in that case, the coefficient would indeed be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expression, which is 64, giving 384. Hmm, but let me make sure I'm not missing something. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, so the answer is 6, but that seems unlikely because the second part is multiplied in. Wait, but no, because the entire expression is a product, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 multiplied by the sum of the coefficients of all terms in the second expression, which is 64, so 6*64=384. Wait, but maybe I'm making a mistake here. Let me think again. If I have two polynomials, P(a,b) and Q(c), then the product P(a,b)*Q(c) would have terms where each term in P is multiplied by each term in Q. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in P(a,b) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in Q(c), because each term in Q(c) is multiplied by the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. So, yes, that would be 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, maybe I can consider it as two separate products. Wait, but let me check with an example. Suppose I have (a + b)^1*(c + 1/c)^1. Then, expanding, it's (a + b)(c + 1/c). The coefficient of a^2b^2 would be zero because in (a + b)^1, the highest power of a is 1, and similarly for b. Wait, but in this case, the problem is (a + b)^4*(c + 1/c)^6, and we're looking for a^2b^2, which is a specific term in (a + b)^4, and then multiplied by the entire expansion of (c + 1/c)^6. So, the coefficient would indeed be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expression, which is 64, so 6*64=384. Alternatively, maybe I can think of it as the coefficient of a^2b^2 in the first part times the entire second part, so 6 times (c + 1/c)^6. But when we're just looking for the coefficient, we can treat it as 6 times the sum of the coefficients in (c + 1/c)^6, which is 64, so 6*64=384. Therefore, I think the coefficient is 384.\n\nWait, but I just realized something. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but in the entire product, \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by various powers of \\(c\\). So, if the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, then the coefficient would indeed be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expression, which is 64, so 384. But if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some specific \\(k\\), then that would be different. But since the problem only specifies \\(a^2b^2\\), I think it's safe to assume that we're only concerned with the coefficients of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, meaning that the coefficient would be 6 times 64, which is 384.\n\nWait, but let me make sure. Alternatively, maybe the problem is written as \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), and we're supposed to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, which would include terms with \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). But in that case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), meaning that the coefficient is 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient, so perhaps it's expecting a numerical coefficient, not a polynomial. Wait, that can't be right because \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by various powers of \\(c\\). So, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times some power of \\(c\\), but since it's not specified, maybe it's just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), which would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 64, so 6*64=384.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused now. Let me try another approach. Let's consider the entire expression as \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). If I expand this, I get the product of two expansions. So, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, multiplied by each term in the second part. But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 64, so 6*64=384.\n\nWait, but maybe the problem is expecting me to consider that the entire product is a single expression, and \\(a^2b^2\\) is just one term, so the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expression. So, yes, 6*64=384.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can calculate the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) separately and then see what the coefficient is. Let's try that. Using the binomial theorem, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(1/c\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). The sum of all coefficients would be when \\(c = 1\\), so plugging \\(c = 1\\), we get \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} = 2^6 = 64\\), which matches what I found earlier.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but I just thought of something else. If the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, and the product includes terms with \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), then technically, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem didn't specify any particular power of \\(c\\), so perhaps it's just asking for the coefficient as a polynomial, meaning that it's 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, not a single number. Hmm, that seems more accurate. Wait, but the problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", so maybe it's expecting a numerical coefficient, which would imply that it's considering all terms in \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) as part of the coefficient. So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial. But that doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a coefficient, which is usually a number, not a polynomial. So, perhaps I misinterpreted the problem. Maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), that is, the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. Because otherwise, the coefficient would be a polynomial, which doesn't make sense as a single number.\n\nWait, that makes more sense. So, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\), which is 1. So, in that case, I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), and then multiply those two coefficients together.\n\nOkay, let's try that approach. First, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\), as I found earlier.\n\nNow, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). To find that, I can use the binomial expansion. The general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\), as I wrote before. We want the exponent of \\(c\\) to be 0, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which implies \\(m = 3\\). So, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nWait, that makes more sense because the problem is asking for a specific coefficient, which would be a number, not a polynomial. So, perhaps I misread the problem initially and didn't consider that the \\(c\\) terms might need to cancel out to \\(c^0\\). Therefore, the correct approach is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part and multiply them together.\n\nSo, to recap: The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nBut wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake here. The problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", without specifying any \\(c\\) terms. So, perhaps it's expecting the coefficient regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expression, which is 64, giving 384. But on the other hand, if the problem is implying that \\(c\\) terms must cancel out to 1, then it's 120. Hmm, I'm a bit confused now.\n\nWait, perhaps I can check the problem again. It says: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, it's just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), without any mention of \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial. But that doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a coefficient, which is a number, not a polynomial. Therefore, perhaps the problem is intended to ask for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning that the \\(c\\) terms must cancel out to 1, giving a numerical coefficient. So, in that case, the answer would be 120.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times any power of \\(c\\), so the coefficient would be 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but that's a polynomial, not a number. So, perhaps the problem is expecting the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), which would be 120.\n\nWait, maybe I can look for similar problems or think about how such problems are usually phrased. Typically, when a problem asks for the coefficient of a term involving multiple variables, it's referring to the term where all the variables are present with the specified exponents, and any other variables are implicitly considered to have zero exponents. So, in this case, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning that \\(c\\) is not present. So, that would make the coefficient 120.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to have \\(c\\) terms as well, but the way it's written, it's just asking for \\(a^2b^2\\), so maybe the answer is 384. But I'm not sure. Wait, let me think again.\n\nIf I consider the product \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\), and it's multiplied by every term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial. But since the problem is asking for a coefficient, which is a number, I must have made a mistake in interpreting the problem.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is written incorrectly, or perhaps I'm misinterpreting it. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, meaning that the answer is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expression, which is 64, so 384.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can think of it as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product being 6 times the entire second expression, so 6*(c + 1/c)^6, which is a polynomial, but since the problem is asking for a coefficient, perhaps it's intended to be a numerical coefficient, so maybe 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expression, which is 64, so 384.\n\nWait, but I'm still confused because the problem didn't specify any particular power of \\(c\\). So, perhaps the intended answer is 384, but I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, maybe the problem expects me to consider that the \\(c\\) terms are separate and don't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms, so the coefficient is just 6. But that seems unlikely because the problem includes the second expression, so it's probably part of the coefficient.\n\nWait, perhaps I can check the problem again. It says: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expression, which is 64, so 6*64=384.\n\nBut I'm still not entirely confident. Alternatively, perhaps I can consider that the \\(c\\) terms don't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms, so the coefficient is just 6. But that doesn't seem right because the second expression is part of the product.\n\nWait, maybe I can think of it as the entire product being a product of two polynomials, and the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial and the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial. So, 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting me to consider that the \\(c\\) terms are separate and that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just 6, but that seems unlikely because the second expression is part of the product.\n\nWait, let me think differently. Let's consider the entire expression as a product of two polynomials: P(a, b) = (a + b)^4 and Q(c) = (c + 1/c)^6. When you multiply P(a, b) by Q(c), each term in P is multiplied by each term in Q. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in P is multiplied by each term in Q, which includes terms with different powers of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in P multiplied by the entire Q(c). But since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, the coefficient would be 6 times Q(c), which is a polynomial. But the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, so perhaps it's expecting the coefficient when all \\(c\\) terms are considered, meaning that the answer is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in Q(c), which is 64, so 6*64=384.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to have the \\(c\\) terms cancel out, so that the coefficient is a numerical value, in which case, as I calculated earlier, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in Q(c) is 20, so the coefficient would be 6*20=120.\n\nWait, I think I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try to approach it methodically.\n\nFirst, to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), we can consider the product as a product of two polynomials. Each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial. Because each term in the second polynomial contributes to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\).\n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial is 6. The sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\(\\left(1 + 1/1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then we need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second polynomial. The coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\), as I calculated earlier. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nBut since the problem didn't specify any \\(c\\) terms, I think the intended answer is 384, as that is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms.\n\nWait, but I'm still a bit unsure. Let me check online for similar problems. Hmm, I don't have access to that right now, but I can think of another way. If I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\), so the entire expression becomes \\((a + b)^4 * 64\\). Then, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in this case would be 6 * 64 = 384, which matches my earlier calculation. Therefore, I think the correct answer is 384.\n\nSo, to summarize:\n\n1. Find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6.\n2. Find the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 64.\n3. Multiply them together: 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is 384.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{384}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem for both parts of the expression.\n\n1. **Expanding \\((a + b)^4\\)**:\n   Using the binomial theorem, we have:\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\), so the coefficient is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\n   \\]\n\n2. **Considering the second part \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)**:\n   The sum of all coefficients in this expression is found by setting \\(c = 1\\):\n   \\[\n   \\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\n   \\]\n\n3. **Combining the results**:\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the product of the coefficient from the first part and the sum of the coefficients from the second part:\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 64 = 384\n   \\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\boxed{384}\\)."

But since I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I can consider the product as \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), and the terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) will multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term, but since we're only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), perhaps those other terms don't affect it. Wait, no, that's not quite right. Wait, actually, when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, for the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), it's multiplied by every term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), that means I need to find the term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) that is a constant term, i.e., the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. Because when I multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by this constant term, it will still be \\(a^2b^2\\), and all other terms will involve some power of \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), which would make the product have more variables than just \\(a^2b^2\\). So, to get the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), and then multiply it by the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6. So, let's work on finding the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Again, using the binomial theorem, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying each term: \\(c^{6 - m} \\times c^{-m} = c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, so we set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\): \\(6 - 2m = 0\\) \u2192 \\(2m = 6\\) \u2192 \\(m = 3\\). So, the constant term is when \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Now, going back to the original expression, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the constant term in the other part is 20. So, when we multiply these two parts together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) will be 6 multiplied by 20, which is 120. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake. So, the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) gives me 6 as the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\), and the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) gives me 20 as the constant term. So, when I multiply these two, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term is multiplied by 20, resulting in 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120. Hmm, that seems right. Let me double-check the calculations. \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) is indeed 6, and \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\) is 20, so 6*20=120. Yeah, that makes sense.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is found by considering the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20, and multiplying it by the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6.

But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term from \\((a + b)^4\\), the other part involving \\(c\\) can be any term from the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that seems a bit confusing. Let me think again. Since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are only in the first part, and \\(c\\) is only in the second part, the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are independent of \\(c\\). So, when I multiply the two expansions, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) will be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because each term in the second expansion will multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term, but since we're just looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) will be 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. Wait, is that correct? Wait, no. Actually, when you multiply two expressions, the coefficients multiply term by term. But in this case, since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), it's just the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and the entire second part's expansion. But wait, no, that's not right either. Because when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. So, if I have \\((a + b)^4\\) expanded, and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) expanded, then the product will have terms like \\(a^kb^{4 - k}c^m\\) or \\(a^kb^{4 - k}c^{6 - m}\\) depending on how the second expansion goes. But since \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) are involved, the exponents can vary. However, the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, that means that in the product, any term that has \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by any power of \\(c\\) will contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part, because each term in the second part will multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term, contributing to the coefficient. Wait, but is that accurate? Let me think again. The second part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When expanded, it will have terms like \\(c^6\\), \\(6c^4\\), \\(15c^2\\), \\(20\\), \\(15c^{-2}\\), \\(6c^{-4}\\), and \\(c^{-6}\\). So, each term in the second expansion has a coefficient, and when we multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), each of those coefficients will multiply \\(a^2b^2\\), so the total coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be \\(6\\) (from the first part) times the sum of all coefficients in the second part. But wait, the sum of all coefficients in the second part is found by setting \\(c = 1\\). So, \\(\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). Wait, but that seems too straightforward. Let me check this again. Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are in the first part and \\(c\\) is in the second, the coefficients for \\(a^2b^2\\) will just be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, each term in the second expansion will contribute to the coefficient. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Therefore, yes, it's 6 times 64, which is 384. But let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. Another way to think about it: when you have two polynomials multiplied together, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum of the products of the coefficients of terms whose variables multiply to give that specific term. In this case, since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), every term in the second expansion will multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term, and the coefficients will add up. So, the total coefficient is indeed the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the sum of coefficients in the second part. Therefore, 6 times 64 is 384. Alternatively, perhaps I can compute the expansion of the second part and sum its coefficients. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). The coefficients are \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\) for each \\(m\\). So, the sum of all coefficients is when \\(c = 1\\), which is \\(2^6 = 64\\), as I thought before. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). So, I think that's the answer. Wait, but let me double-check. Alternatively, perhaps I'm supposed to consider that when you multiply the two expressions, the terms involving \\(c\\) might affect the coefficient, but no, because the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, each term in the second expansion will contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when multiplied by the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first expansion.

But that doesn't seem right because we're looking for a specific term, \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\). Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)\". So, perhaps the entire expression is a product, and we need to find the coefficient of the term where \\(a\\) is squared, \\(b\\) is squared, and the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out, so that the term doesn't involve \\(c\\). Hmm, that makes more sense. So, I think the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be the term where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel each other out. So, that term would come from multiplying the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from \\((a + b)^4\\) by the term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) that has \\(c^0\\), meaning the constant term.

Let me work on that. Using the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\).

So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Wait, but let me make sure I didn't miss anything. So, \\((a + b)^4\\) gives \\(a^2b^2\\) with coefficient 6, and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) gives a constant term with coefficient 20.

So, if I substitute \\(c = 1\\) into \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), I'll get the sum of all coefficients. Let me try that.

So, perhaps the coefficient is 6 multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, giving 384. But wait, let me think again. When you have two separate polynomials multiplied together, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each polynomial. But in this case, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term is only in the first polynomial, and the second polynomial doesn't have \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), so when you multiply, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is just the coefficient from the first polynomial times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial. Because each term in the second polynomial, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), will give a term with \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by some power of \\(c\\), and the coefficient of each such term is the product of the coefficients from each part. But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 64.

So, each term has a coefficient, and when you multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), you get terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(6a^2b^2c^4\\), etc. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is only the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, because otherwise, it's \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some \\(k\\), not just \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, that's a good point. So, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. It says, \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", but in the entire product, \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by various powers of \\(c\\). So, unless \\(c^0 = 1\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion. So, maybe I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), and then multiply that by 6. Let me try that approach. So, first, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, as we found earlier. Now, in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term where \\(c^0\\) is the constant term. So, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Let me expand that using the binomial theorem. The expansion is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(1/c\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, we need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be 0, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). That makes more sense because if we're looking for the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2, and the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, then it's \\(a^2b^2\\) times the constant term from the second expansion. So, I think 120 is the correct coefficient.\n\nWait, let me double-check. So, in \\((a + b)^4\\), \\(a^2b^2\\) has a coefficient of 6. In \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the constant term is 20. So, when you multiply these together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times the constant term is 6 * 20 = 120. So, yes, that seems correct. I think my initial confusion was whether the problem was asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), which would mean considering all possible \\(c\\) terms, but upon reflection, I think it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), which is 120. Therefore, the final answer is 120.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break down the problem into two parts:\n\n1. **Expanding \\((a + b)^4\\):**\n   Using the binomial theorem, the term containing \\(a^2b^2\\) is found when \\(k = 2\\) in the expansion:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2}a^{2}b^{2} = 6a^{2}b^{2}\n   \\]\n   So, the coefficient is 6.\n\n2. **Finding the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   The expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem is:\n   \\[\n   \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n   \\]\n   To find the constant term (\\(c^0\\)), set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\). The coefficient is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\n   \\]\n\n3. **Combining the coefficients:**\n   Multiply the coefficient from the first part by the constant term from the second part:\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 20 = 120\n   \\]\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

However, since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and the second part doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), maybe I can just consider the coefficient from the first part and then see how the second part affects it. Wait, actually, no. Because when you multiply two expressions together, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second. But in this case, since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and the second expression doesn't have \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), the only term that affects \\(a^2b^2\\) is the term where we take \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part and multiply it by any term from the second part. But wait, actually, since the second part is a separate expression, when we multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and the second expansion doesn't have \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will be multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But wait, that can't be right because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\). So, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. Maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, but since the product is a polynomial in \\(a, b, c, 1/c\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by any combination from the second part. But that seems complicated. Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think again. The problem is: What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, when you expand the product, each term will be of the form (term from first expansion) multiplied by (term from second expansion). The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the first expansion, and it's multiplied by every term in the second expansion. But since the second expansion is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which has terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), the entire coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be \\(6 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that seems odd because then the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\), not a single number. Wait, perhaps I'm misinterpreting the question. Maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, so the coefficient would include terms from the second expansion. But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, which doesn't make much sense because usually, the coefficient is a constant. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\), ignoring the second part, but that would be 6, which seems too simple. Wait, maybe the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where the exponents of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) cancel out, so that the overall term is just \\(a^2b^2\\). That would make sense because otherwise, the coefficient would involve \\(c\\) terms, which isn't typical. So, perhaps I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, considering only the terms where the exponents of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) multiply to give \\(c^0\\), i.e., the constant term in the second expansion. So, in that case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). That seems plausible. So, first, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Let me think about that. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is given by the binomial theorem as \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(1/c\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We want the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which implies \\(k = 3\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\), which is \\(\\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the coefficient from the second part, which is 20. So, 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient is 120. Wait, let me double-check that. So, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6. In \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the constant term (where exponent of \\(c\\) is 0) is when \\(k = 3\\), so \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, when you multiply the two expansions, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by 20, so the coefficient becomes 6 * 20 = 120. That seems correct. Alternatively, if I were to expand the entire product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by every term in the second expansion, but since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a specific term without any \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), it must be that we're looking for the coefficient when the \\(c\\) terms cancel out, i.e., the constant term in the second expansion. So, yes, 120 is the correct coefficient.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplying it by the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20. Therefore, the final coefficient is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n$\\boxed{120}$"

But that doesn't make sense because \\(a^2b^2\\) is a single term, so I think I'm confusing something here. Maybe I need to consider that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, which would include all the \\(c\\) terms. But that seems complicated. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when considering the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) parts, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, in that case, the coefficient would just be 6, because the \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) part doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. Wait, that seems more plausible. Let me check. If I have \\((a + b)^4\\) times something else, then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the same as the coefficient in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire second expression. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), perhaps the coefficient remains 6, and the \\(c\\) terms just tag along. But that can't be right because when you multiply, the coefficients multiply as well. Wait, no, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times whatever the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion is. Wait, that might be the case. Let me think again. When you have two polynomials multiplied together, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum of the products of the coefficients of terms that multiply to give that specific term. But in this case, since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), any term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\) will result in a term that includes \\(c\\) raised to some power. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term without \\(c\\). Wait, that's impossible because the entire expression includes \\(c\\) terms. So, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, regardless of the \\(c\\) exponents. That is, we need to find all terms where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2, regardless of the exponents of \\(c\\). But that seems a bit odd because the problem is written as \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), so when you expand, each term will have some combination of \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\), and \\(1/c\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that has \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by some combination of \\(c\\) terms. But perhaps the question is only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion.

So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 * 64 = 384? Hmm, but that seems high. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me try to approach it differently. The problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, to find this, I can consider that each term in the product will be of the form \\(a^kb^{4 - k} \\times c^m\\) or \\(a^kb^{4 - k} \\times c^{-m}\\), depending on the expansion. But the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\(k = 2\\) in the first part, so that's 6a^2b^2, and then multiplied by each term from the second expansion. But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would make the coefficient a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the coefficient should be a constant. Wait, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\), which is 1. That would make more sense. So, perhaps I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product. If that's the case, then I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), then multiply them together. That sounds more accurate. So, first, as before, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. Now, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). To do that, I can use the binomial theorem again. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\times (1/c)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, we need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be 0. That is, \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(m = 3\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire product is 6 * 20 = 120. Wait, but the problem didn't specify the \\(c^0\\) term, just \\(a^2b^2\\). So, maybe I'm supposed to consider all possible \\(c\\) exponents, but that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but that would make the coefficient a polynomial, not a constant. So, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating \\(c\\) as a variable, which would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that seems odd because the coefficient should be a number, not an expression. Therefore, I think the problem must be asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be 6 * 20 = 120. So, I think that's the answer. Let me double-check. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 20. Multiplying them gives 120. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is found using the binomial theorem, which gives 6. The coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is also found using the binomial theorem, resulting in 20. Multiplying these coefficients together gives 6 * 20 = 120.\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is 120.\n\n\\boxed{120}"

When you multiply two polynomials, the coefficients of the resulting terms are products of the coefficients from each polynomial.

So, the sum of coefficients is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). But I'm not entirely sure if that's correct. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it and the answer is just 6, but that seems too simple. Let me think again. When you have two separate variables, \\(a, b\\) and \\(c\\), their coefficients in the product would be independent. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, perhaps it's just 6. But that doesn't make sense because the expansion includes \\(c\\) terms, so the coefficient would actually be a polynomial in \\(c\\). Therefore, perhaps the problem is intended to consider the entire product and find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times any term involving \\(c\\). But that seems unclear. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, considering all possible terms, but only looking at the \\(a^2b^2\\) term, regardless of the \\(c\\) part. So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 6 times \\((c + 1/c)^6\\). But that's not a number, it's a polynomial. Therefore, perhaps the problem is intended to ask for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where \\(c\\) cancels out. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). In that case, I would need to find the term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, because \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is the term we're interested in. So, let's calculate that. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) can be done using the binomial theorem: \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(1/c\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be zero, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which implies \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part has a coefficient of 6, and the term \\(c^0\\) from the second part has a coefficient of 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). So, the final answer is 120.\n\nWait, but the original problem didn't specify \\(c^0\\), it just asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, maybe I was overcomplicating it by considering \\(c\\). Let me go back. If the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, then the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that's a polynomial, not a single number. Therefore, perhaps the problem is intended to ask for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, which would be 6, because the other part doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) coefficients. But that seems too simple. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, which would require considering all possible \\(c\\) terms. But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense for a numerical answer. Therefore, perhaps the intended interpretation is that the problem wants the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But since the problem is asking for a coefficient, it's likely that they just want 6, as the \\(c\\) terms don't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) coefficients. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion of the entire expression, which would involve considering the \\(c\\) terms. But since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the same as in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that can't be right because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, not an expression. Therefore, perhaps the problem is intended to ask for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, which is 6, and the other part is just a distraction. Alternatively, maybe I need to consider that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 times 64, which is 384. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but that's not a number. So, I'm stuck. Maybe I should look for another approach. Let me consider that the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is \\(6 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial. But the problem is asking for a coefficient, which is a number. Therefore, perhaps the problem is intended to ask for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, regardless of \\(c\\), which would be 6. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some \\(k\\), but it's not specified. Since the problem didn't specify \\(c\\), I think the intended answer is 6. But earlier, when I considered the term where \\(c^0\\), I got 120, which seems more plausible because it's a numerical answer. So, perhaps the problem is intended to ask for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. Alternatively, maybe the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, which would involve all possible \\(c\\) terms, but that's not a single number. Therefore, I think the correct interpretation is that the problem wants the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. So, I'll go with that.\n\nWait, let me check again. If I expand \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. Then, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) expands to terms involving \\(c^6, c^4, c^2, c^0, c^{-2}, c^{-4}, c^{-6}\\). So, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each of these terms. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a number, so perhaps they mean the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). As I calculated earlier, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20, so 6 times 20 is 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is 120. Since the problem didn't specify \\(c^0\\), but just asked for \\(a^2b^2\\), perhaps that's the intended answer. So, I think the answer is 120.\n\nWait, but let me make sure. If the problem had asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for any \\(k\\), then it would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^k\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But since it's just \\(a^2b^2\\), without any \\(c\\) term, perhaps it's considering all possible \\(c\\) terms, which would make the coefficient a polynomial. But that doesn't make sense for a numerical coefficient. Therefore, perhaps the problem is intended to ask for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, which is 6, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. Alternatively, maybe the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, which would involve considering all possible \\(c\\) terms, but that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, not a number. Therefore, perhaps the problem is intended to ask for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. So, I think that's the answer they're looking for.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break it down as follows:\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\):\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} a^{2}b^{2} = 6a^2b^2\n   \\]\n   So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\n2. **Consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n   \\]\n   We need the term where \\(c^0\\) (since we are looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms).

Wait, that doesn't seem right. Wait, actually, no, because when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).

So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't seem right because each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) has different powers of \\(c\\), so when we multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), the resulting term would have \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by each term from the other expansion, each of which has some power of \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which I think refers to the coefficient regardless of the power of \\(c\\). Wait, no, actually, maybe the problem is just looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, perhaps I need to consider that when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by every term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems a bit off because the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) would be when \\(c = 1\\), so substituting \\(c = 1\\), we get \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, then the coefficient would be 6 times 64, which is 384. But wait, that seems high. Let me think again. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Since the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), perhaps I can treat the \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) as a separate part that doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, considering all possible terms, so the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which as I thought before is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. But let me check that again. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, without considering the \\(c\\) terms, so maybe the answer is just 6, but that doesn't seem right because the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which would affect the coefficient. Wait, perhaps I should think of it differently. When you expand \\((a + b)^4\\), you get terms like \\(a^4\\), \\(a^3b\\), \\(a^2b^2\\), etc. Each of these terms is then multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the sum of all coefficients in the second part, because each term in the second part contributes a coefficient that multiplies \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 * 64 = 384. But let me make sure. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, so the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion, but that doesn't make sense because coefficients are numerical. Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Let me try another approach. Let me consider that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Since the sum of coefficients in the second part is 64, as I found earlier, then the total coefficient would be 6 * 64 = 384. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 384. But wait, I'm not entirely sure. Let me check with a smaller exponent to see if this makes sense. Suppose instead of exponent 6, we had exponent 0. Then \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^0 = 1\\), so the coefficient would be 6 * 1 = 6, which is correct. If exponent 1, then \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^1 = c + 1/c\\), so the sum of coefficients is 1 + 1 = 2, so the coefficient would be 6 * 2 = 12. Let me see if that makes sense. Expanding \\((a + b)^4(c + 1/c)^1\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by both \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), so the coefficient would be 6 * (1 + 1) = 12, which is correct. So, that seems to confirm that my approach is correct. Therefore, for exponent 6, the sum of coefficients is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is found by first determining the coefficient in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplying it by the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 64.

Wait, no, because when you multiply two polynomials, each term from the first polynomial is multiplied by each term from the second. So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I need to consider how many ways \\(a^2b^2\\) can appear when multiplied by terms from the second expression. But actually, since the second expression is in terms of \\(c\\), and \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first part will just be multiplied by every term in the second part, but the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would still just be 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because the \\(a^2b^2\\) term is being multiplied by the entire second expression. But that seems odd because the problem is asking for a coefficient, which is usually a number, not an expression in \\(c\\). Maybe I'm missing something here. Wait, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where the exponents of \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are 2, 2, and 0, respectively. That would make sense because then we're looking for a specific term in the product. So, in that case, I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and then find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), and then multiply those two coefficients together. That would give me the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire product. So, let me try that approach. First, as before, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. Now, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me expand that using the binomial theorem as well. So, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\).

Wait, no, that would be if we were considering the entire product, but the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so maybe the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, because each term in the second expansion would multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term, contributing their coefficients. Wait, but the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion is obtained by setting \\(c = 1\\), so let me check that. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think again. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) will be multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), so the total coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 multiplied by the sum of the coefficients of all terms in the second expansion. But wait, the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion is when \\(c = 1\\), so substituting \\(c = 1\\) into \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, then the coefficient would be 6 times 64, which is 384. But wait, that seems too high. Wait, is that correct? Let me double-check. Alternatively, maybe I don't need to multiply by the sum of all coefficients, but rather, since \\(a^2b^2\\) is independent of \\(c\\), the coefficient would just be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that would make the coefficient a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because we're just looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\). So, perhaps the coefficient is just 6, and the terms involving \\(c\\) are separate. Wait, no, that can't be right because the entire expression is the product of two expansions, so when you multiply them, each term from the first expansion is multiplied by each term from the second expansion. So, for the term \\(a^2b^2\\), which comes from \\((a + b)^4\\), its coefficient is 6, and when you multiply it by each term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each of those terms will have a coefficient that gets multiplied by 6. But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. But that would mean the coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384, as I thought before. But wait, that seems too large. Alternatively, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)\". So, in the entire product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) can be combined with any term from the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. Because each term in the second expansion is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), so the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) across all possible \\(c\\) terms would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion. Since the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion is 64, as I calculated earlier, then the total coefficient would be 6 * 64 = 384. But wait, that seems high, so maybe I'm making a mistake here. Let me think differently. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), so it's just 6, because the other part doesn't affect it. But that doesn't make sense because when you multiply, each term from the first expansion is multiplied by each term from the second, so the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 multiplied by the entire second expansion, which is a polynomial. But the problem is asking for the coefficient, so maybe it's 6 times the sum of the coefficients of the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it, and the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which would be 6 times the entire second expansion, but that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, which doesn't make sense. Wait, no, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so perhaps it's just 6, because the second expansion doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), so when you multiply, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be 6 times the entire second expansion, but that would be a polynomial in \\(c\\), not a single coefficient. Hmm, this is confusing. Maybe I should think of it as the coefficient being 6, and the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term from the second expansion, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 times each coefficient from the second expansion, but the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so perhaps it's 6 times the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to have \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by \\(c^0\\), that is, the constant term in the second expansion. So, maybe I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) and then multiply it by 6. Let me try that. So, first, in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We want the exponent of \\(c\\) to be 0, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\). So, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. So, then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 * 20 = 120. That seems more reasonable. So, perhaps I made a mistake earlier by considering the sum of all coefficients, but the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), so the term where \\(c\\) cancels out. Therefore, the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120. Let me check this again. The first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), has \\(a^2b^2\\) with coefficient 6. The second part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), has a term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, which is when \\(k = 3\\), so the coefficient is 20. Therefore, when you multiply these two, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by 20, so the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120. That makes sense. So, I think the correct answer is 120. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't misinterpret the problem. The problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\" in the entire product. So, in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term is of the form \\(a^{4 - k}b^k c^{6 - 2m} (1/c)^m\\), but I'm only interested in the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) occurs, so \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\), as before. Now, for each such term, the coefficient would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) times \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\) times the coefficient from the \\(c\\) terms. Wait, no, perhaps I'm complicating it again. Alternatively, since \\(a^2b^2\\) is independent of \\(c\\), the coefficient would be the product of the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) and the sum of all coefficients from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 64. So, 6 * 64 = 384. But that contradicts my earlier conclusion of 120. Now I'm confused. Let me try to clarify: when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial, because each term in the second polynomial will be multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), contributing their coefficients. So, if the second polynomial has a sum of coefficients equal to 64, then the total coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 * 64 = 384. But wait, that would mean that the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by every possible term in the second polynomial, which includes different powers of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is indeed 384, as each term in the second polynomial contributes its coefficient when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). But that seems counterintuitive because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not \\(a^2b^2\\) times any \\(c\\) terms. Wait, but in reality, when you multiply two polynomials, each term from the first is multiplied by each term from the second, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the sum over all possible products where the first part contributes \\(a^2b^2\\) and the second part contributes any term, so the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 6 * 64 = 384. But that seems too large, and I'm not sure if that's the correct interpretation. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), that is, the term where \\(c\\) cancels out. In that case, as I calculated earlier, the coefficient would be 6 * 20 = 120. But the problem didn't specify any condition on \\(c\\), so I think it's just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. Therefore, it's 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 6 * 64 = 384. Wait, but that seems too high. Let me think again: when you have two polynomials multiplied together, the coefficient of a specific term in one polynomial is multiplied by the entire other polynomial. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the entire second polynomial. But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. Therefore, perhaps the problem is intended to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), which would be 6 * 20 = 120. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\), so it's just 6, but that seems too simplistic because the second polynomial would affect the overall coefficient. Wait, no, because the second polynomial is multiplied by the first, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times each term in the second polynomial, so the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial. So, 6 * 64 = 384. But I'm not sure. Let me check by expanding a smaller example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, \\((a + b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2\\). \\((c + 1/c)^1 = c + 1/c\\). So, the product is \\(a^2c + a^2/c + 2abc + 2ab/c + b^2c + b^2/c\\). Now, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^0\\) is \\(c + 1/c\\), which is 2 when \\(c = 1\\), but in reality, it's a polynomial. So, perhaps the problem is intended to have the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), so the constant term in \\(c\\). Therefore, in my small example, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^0c^0\\) would be 0, because there's no such term. Alternatively, if I take \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^2\\), then the expansion would include terms like \\(a^2b^0c^2\\), \\(a^2b^0\\), \\(a^2b^0/c^2\\), etc. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^0c^0\\) would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^2\\) times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\((c + 1/c)^2\\). In this case, \\((c + 1/c)^2 = c^2 + 2 + 1/c^2\\), so the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 2. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^0c^0\\) would be 1 (from \\(a^2\\)) times 2, which is 2. Similarly, the coefficient of \\(a^0b^2c^0\\) would also be 1 * 2 = 2. The coefficient of \\(a^1b^1c^0\\) would be 2 * 2 = 4. So, in this small example, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^0c^0\\) is 2, which is the coefficient from the first polynomial times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second polynomial. Therefore, applying this to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) would be 6 (from \\((a + b)^4\\)) times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 20. Therefore, 6 * 20 = 120. So, that must be the correct answer. Therefore, the coefficient is 120.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the calculation for the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). The general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\times (1/c)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We want the exponent of \\(c\\) to be 0, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\). So, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\), which is correct. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is 6 * 20 = 120. So, that's the answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break down the problem using the binomial theorem.\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\), so the coefficient is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\n   \\]\n\n2. **Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n   \\]\n   We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, which occurs when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\).

So, does that mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just 6, and the rest of the terms involving \\(c\\) don't affect it? Hmm, maybe. Wait, but let me think again. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, when I expand this, each term from \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\).

So, in other words, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\).

But since the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term involving only \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and not \\(c\\), I think that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would just be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Wait, that doesn't make sense because the terms involving \\(c\\) would multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term, but \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), so actually, when you multiply, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from \\((a + b)^4\\) would be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), perhaps we're considering the product as a whole and looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). Wait, but that can't be because \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term on its own, so unless there's a term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) that is a constant (i.e., \\(c^0\\)), then the product would have a term \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by that constant. So, maybe the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 times the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). That makes sense because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by the constant term, you get a term involving \\(a^2b^2\\) times that constant, so the coefficient would be 6 times that constant. So, now I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Let me think about that. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) can be done using the binomial theorem as well. So, it would be \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(1/c\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m} = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). The constant term occurs when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. So, set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Let me compute that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 times 20, which is 120. So, I think the answer is 120. Wait, let me double-check my reasoning. I found that in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. Then, in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the constant term is 20. So, when you multiply these two parts together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by the constant term 20 from the second part, resulting in \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\) as the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product.

But that can't be right because the problem is asking for the coefficient, not the entire expression. Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me clarify: The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that only involves \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). The other part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), when expanded, will have terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, when we multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). However, since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term from \\((a + b)^4\\), when we multiply it by each term from the other expansion, it will create terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) and \\(a^2b^2 \\cdot c^{-k}\\) for various \\(k\\). But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, that doesn't make sense because \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), so unless there's a term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) that is 1 (i.e., \\(c^0\\)), then when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), it will contribute to the coefficient. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because only the constant term (the term where \\(c^0\\)) when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\) will give a term that is just \\(a^2b^2\\). All other terms will have \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\) and thus won't contribute to the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. So, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me compute that. Again, using the binomial theorem, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the exponent of \\(c\\) in each term is \\(6 - 2m\\). We want the term where the exponent is 0, so we set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\): \\(6 = 2m\\) \u2192 \\(m = 3\\). So, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficients from each part: 6 (from \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\)) multiplied by 20 (from \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)). So, 6 \u00d7 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. So, \\((a + b)^4\\) gives \\(a^2b^2\\) with coefficient 6. The other part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), has a constant term with coefficient 20. When you multiply these together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by 20, so the coefficient becomes 6 \u00d7 20 = 120. That seems correct. I don't think I made any mistakes here. So, the final answer should be 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem.\n\n1.

    "text": " That means I don't need to consider the terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) because they don't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. So, maybe I can just consider the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) and multiply it by the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but since I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), perhaps the \\(c\\) terms will just multiply by 1, so I can just take the coefficient from the first part. Wait, no, that might not be correct. Let me think again. When I multiply two polynomials, each term from the first polynomial gets multiplied by each term from the second polynomial. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by every term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\), maybe I just need to take the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part and then multiply it by the entire expansion of the second part, but that doesn't make sense because the second part is a separate variable. Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try to clarify. The expression is a product of two separate expressions: one in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and another in \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). Since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\), and \\(1/c\\) are different variables, their exponents don't interfere with each other. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is independent of the terms in the second part. Therefore, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product will just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But wait, that can't be right because the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would then be a polynomial in \\(c\\), but the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, which suggests that maybe we're supposed to consider the constant term in \\(c\\). So, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times the constant term (i.e., the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). That makes more sense. So, maybe I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) and then multiply it by the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) from \\((a + b)^4\\). Let me check that approach. So, first, as before, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. Now, for \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), I can use the binomial theorem again. The expansion is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(1/c\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). I need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, because that's the constant term. So, set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20. Now, since the expression is the product of \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second part. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the second part is in \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), the only way for the product to have \\(a^2b^2\\) is when we multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by the constant term in \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the coefficient from the first part (6) multiplied by the constant term from the second part (20). Therefore, 6 * 20 = 120. So, the coefficient is 120. Wait, but let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. Alternatively, maybe I should consider that when you multiply the two expressions, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is multiplied by every term in the second part, which includes terms with different powers of \\(c\\). However, the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). But that doesn't make sense because \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by each term in the second part, leading to terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for various \\(k\\). So, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, considering all possible terms, but that would mean that the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", which suggests that maybe it's considering only the constant term, i.e., the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. So, that would mean that the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120. Alternatively, perhaps I'm misinterpreting the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\).\" So, in the entire expansion, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) could be multiplied by various powers of \\(c\\), but the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would include all the terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. But that would mean that the coefficient is a sum over all possible \\(c\\) terms, which would be the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that can't be right because the coefficient would then be a polynomial, not a single number. So, perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times the constant term, i.e., the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. That makes sense because otherwise, the coefficient would be a polynomial, which doesn't seem to be the case here. So, I think the intended interpretation is that we need the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, considering only the constant term with respect to \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, which would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. So, I think the correct approach is to consider the constant term in the second expansion and multiply it by the coefficient from the first expansion. Therefore, the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). For the second part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the constant term is when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, which occurs at \\(m = 3\\), giving \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying these together gives 6 * 20 = 120. So, yes, that seems correct. I don't think I made any mistakes here.

But that seems like it would result in an expression with terms involving \\(c\\), which isn't what the problem is asking for. Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem.

But that doesn't seem right either because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not considering \\(c\\). Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think differently. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). If I expand both parts separately, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term comes from \\((a + b)^4\\) and is multiplied by every term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean I need to find the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Alternatively, maybe I'm supposed to treat \\(c\\) as a variable and just find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems odd because the problem is probably expecting a numerical coefficient, not an expression involving \\(c\\). Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable, so the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which would mean that the coefficient is 6, and the rest of the terms are separate. Wait, that might make sense. Let me check. If I have \\((a + b)^4\\) which has a term \\(6a^2b^2\\), and then I multiply it by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is another polynomial, then the product will have terms like \\(6a^2b^2 \\times \\text{something with } c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but the sum of coefficients in a polynomial is found by setting all variables to 1. So, if I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times 64, which is 384. But wait, that seems high. Let me think again. Alternatively, perhaps I'm supposed to consider that when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the \\(a^2b^2\\) term is only multiplied by the constant term in the second expansion, which would be the term where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out, i.e., \\(c^0\\). So, perhaps I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) and then multiply it by 6. Let me check that approach. So, first, find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We want the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\). So, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, the constant term is 20. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (the constant term from the second part), which is 120. That makes more sense. So, the answer should be 120. Wait, let me confirm. So, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. In \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the constant term is 20. Therefore, when you multiply these two, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by 20, giving a coefficient of 6 * 20 = 120. So, yes, that seems correct. Alternatively, if I think about expanding both parts and multiplying, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part, but only the constant term in the second part doesn't involve \\(c\\), so it's the only term that contributes to the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the product. Therefore, the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120. So, I think that's the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is found using the binomial theorem, which gives 6.

Wait, but is there a constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)? Let me check. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the exponent of \\(c\\) in each term is \\(6 - 2m\\). To find the constant term, we set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which gives \\(m = 3\\). So, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} c^0 = \\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, when we multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by 20, because that's the constant term. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 (from \\((a + b)^4\\)) multiplied by 20 (the constant term from the other expansion), which is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Wait, but let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. So, the entire expression is a product of two polynomials: one in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the other in \\(c\\). When you multiply them, the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from those involving \\(c\\).

But since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then actually, every term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) will multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. Wait, no, that's not right. Because when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. So, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part will be multiplied by every term in the second part, which includes all the \\(c\\) terms. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which implies that we're considering all possible powers of \\(c\\). So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion, which doesn't make sense because the coefficient should be a number, not a polynomial. So, I must have misunderstood the problem. Wait, perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, but without specifying any particular power of \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems odd because the coefficient would then be a polynomial in \\(c\\). However, the problem didn't specify any particular term involving \\(c\\), just \\(a^2b^2\\). So, perhaps the answer is indeed 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that doesn't seem right because the problem is likely expecting a numerical coefficient. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), that is, the constant term with respect to \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the constant term of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20, as I found earlier. So, 6 times 20 is 120. That makes sense. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120. Let me double-check my reasoning. The expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) gives \\(a^2b^2\\) with coefficient 6. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) has a constant term (i.e., \\(c^0\\)) of 20. When you multiply the two expansions together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by every term in the second expansion. But if we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then it's actually an infinite sum, which doesn't make sense. Therefore, the problem must be asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by the constant term in the \\(c\\) expansion. Therefore, the coefficient is 6 times 20, which is 120. Alternatively, if the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without considering \\(c\\), then the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, which seems unlikely.

    "text": " So, does that mean I can ignore the \\(c\\) terms? Hmm, maybe not exactly. Wait, because when I multiply two expressions together, each term from the first expression gets multiplied by each term from the second expression. But since I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), perhaps the terms involving \\(c\\) won't affect that coefficient. Let me think. When I expand \\((a + b)^4\\), I get terms like \\(a^4\\), \\(4a^3b\\), \\(6a^2b^2\\), etc. Similarly, when I expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), I get terms involving \\(c^6\\), \\(6c^5\\), \\(15c^4\\), and so on, down to \\(c^0\\) which is 1, and then the terms start with negative exponents: \\(6c^{-1}\\), \\(15c^{-2}\\), etc. So, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion gets multiplied by each term in the second. But since I'm only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which comes from the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), I need to see how that term interacts with the terms in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term is just a constant with respect to \\(c\\), so when I multiply it by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't seem right because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term in the product, but the \\(c\\) terms would affect the overall expression. Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try a different approach. Since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), the terms involving \\(c\\) don't affect the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). So, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that can't be, because that would make the coefficient a sum of terms involving \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, not a polynomial in \\(c\\). Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" Hmm, perhaps the problem is expecting the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in other words, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by any combination of \\(c\\) terms. But that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that would be 6 times \\(2^6\\) because each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) has coefficients that sum to \\(2^6 = 64\\). So, 6 times 64 would be 384. But that seems high. Wait, let me check that again. The sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, yes, the sum of the coefficients is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 * 64 = 384. Wait, but that seems too straightforward. Alternatively, perhaps I'm supposed to consider only the constant term in the \\(c\\) expansion. Because if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), maybe I also want the term where the power of \\(c\\) is zero, so that the entire expression is just a constant multiple of \\(a^2b^2\\). Let me think. The problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", which typically refers to the coefficient when the term is standalone, without any other variables. So, perhaps I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, which would involve multiplying by the constant term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, that would mean I need to find the term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, i.e., the constant term, and then multiply that by the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\). So, let's try that approach. First, find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which we already found to be 6. Then, find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). To find the constant term, we can use the binomial theorem again. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, so 6 - 2k = 0. Solving for k: 6 - 2k = 0 \u21d2 2k = 6 \u21d2 k = 3. So, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\), which is 20. Therefore, the constant term is 20. Now, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 (from \\((a + b)^4\\)) multiplied by 20 (from the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)), giving 6 * 20 = 120. Wait, so which is it? Earlier, I thought it might be 384, but now I'm getting 120. Let me clarify. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. If the product is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), then when you expand this, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from \\((a + b)^4\\) would be multiplied by every term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), resulting in terms like \\(6a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(6a^2b^2c^5\\), etc. So, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then it would be 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384. But if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where the exponents of \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are 2, 2, and 0 respectively, then it would be 6 * 20 = 120. The problem statement isn't entirely clear, but I think it's more likely that it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), so 384. However, let me check the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" It doesn't specify any condition on \\(c\\), so I think it's asking for the coefficient of the term \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by any power of \\(c\\). So, that would mean the coefficient is 6 * (sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\)), which is 6 * 64 = 384. Wait, but earlier I thought the sum of coefficients is 64, which is correct because \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, that would make the coefficient 384. But I'm a bit confused because sometimes in such problems, they might be looking for the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, but I think in this case, it's more general. Alternatively, maybe I should consider that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, which would include all possible powers of \\(c\\), so the coefficient would be 6 * 64 = 384. But let me think again. If I expand \\((a + b)^4\\), I get terms like \\(a^4\\), \\(4a^3b\\), \\(6a^2b^2\\), \\(4ab^3\\), \\(b^4\\). Each of these terms is then multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, resulting in terms like \\(6a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(6a^2b^2c^5\\), etc., all the way down to \\(6a^2b^2c^{-6}\\). Therefore, in the entire product, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for any integer \\(k\\) would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^k\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), without specifying any power of \\(c\\). So, perhaps the question is a bit ambiguous. But in most cases, when the problem asks for the coefficient of a specific term in a product, it's referring to the term where the exponents of the variables match, without considering other variables. Wait, but in this case, the variables are \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\), so \\(a^2b^2\\) would imply that the exponents of \\(c\\) are zero, meaning it's a constant term. So, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be 6 * 20 = 120. Alternatively, if it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), then it would be 6 * 64 = 384. I think I need to determine which interpretation is correct. Let me consider the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" The term \\(a^2b^2\\) is in the product, but the product also includes \\(c\\) terms. So, in the expanded form, each term is a product of powers of \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\). Therefore, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by some power of \\(c\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would actually be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some \\(k\\), but since the problem doesn't specify \\(k\\), it's ambiguous. However, in standard problems, when they ask for the coefficient of a term with certain exponents of some variables, they usually mean the term where those variables have those exponents and the other variables have their exponents as zero or as part of the term. So, in this case, since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term in the product, and \\(c\\) is another variable, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be accompanied by some power of \\(c\\), so the coefficient would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some \\(k\\). But without knowing \\(k\\), it's unclear. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) irrespective of \\(c\\), meaning the sum over all \\(k\\) of the coefficients of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\). That would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, if the problem is expecting the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is the term where \\(c\\) cancels out, then it's 6 * 20 = 120. Let me see which makes more sense. In problems like this, when they ask for the coefficient of a specific term in a product, they usually mean the term where all variables have the specified exponents. So, if they say \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", they might be implying that the exponents of \\(c\\) are zero, i.e., the term \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). So, that would be 120. Alternatively, if they had said \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^3\\)\", that would be a different term. But since they just said \\(a^2b^2\\), perhaps they mean the term where \\(c\\) is raised to zero. So, I think the correct approach is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the answer should be 120. Wait, but let me confirm this. Let me think of it as a product of two polynomials: one in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the other in \\(c\\). So, when you multiply them, each term from the first polynomial is multiplied by each term from the second. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial multiplied by the entire second polynomial. But that doesn't make sense because the second polynomial is in \\(c\\), so the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, which suggests that they are considering the term where \\(c\\) is raised to the zero power. So, I think the correct interpretation is that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the answer is 120. Wait, but earlier I thought 384, but now I'm more confident it's 120. Let me just recap: \\((a + b)^4\\) gives a term \\(6a^2b^2\\). \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) has a constant term 20. So, when multiplied, the term \\(6a^2b^2 * 20 = 120a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient is 120. Yes, that makes sense. So, I think the correct answer is 120.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break down the problem into two parts using the binomial theorem.\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\):**\n   Using the binomial theorem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n\n2. **Find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   The constant term occurs when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero.

Wait, no, that doesn't make sense because when you multiply two expressions, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that would mean the coefficient is 6 times whatever the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is. But that seems too broad. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the powers of \\(c\\).

So, that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that doesn't seem right either because each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) has different powers of \\(c\\), so when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), each term would contribute to a different term in the product. Wait, but the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so maybe it's just the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), meaning that the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the entire product and wants the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, so it's effectively 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expression, which is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me check that. The sum of the coefficients in a polynomial is found by setting all variables to 1. So, if I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = (1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times 64, which is 384. But wait, that seems too straightforward. Let me think again. Alternatively, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the entire expression, which doesn't make sense because each term in the product would have different powers of \\(c\\). Wait, perhaps the problem is only considering the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) irrespective of the \\(c\\) terms. So, in other words, in the expansion, each term would be of the form \\(a^2b^2 \\times c^k\\) for some \\(k\\), and the coefficient would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^k\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But then, if that's the case, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 64, as before, so 6 times 64 is 384. But wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me approach it differently. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When you expand this, each term will be a product of a term from \\((a + b)^4\\) and a term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial, not a single coefficient. So, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some \\(k\\), but the problem as stated is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so maybe it's considering the entire product and treating \\(c\\) as another variable, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't make sense because the coefficient should be a number, not an expression. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, so each term would have \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some \\(k\\), and the coefficient would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^k\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but since \\(k\\) can vary, the problem might be asking for the sum of all coefficients of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) across all \\(k\\), which would indeed be 6 times 64, which is 384. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only considering the part \\((a + b)^4\\) and wants the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is 6, and the rest is just multiplied as a constant factor. But that doesn't seem right because the entire expression is a product, so the coefficient would be 6 times the expansion of the other part. Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think again. The problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each polynomial. But in this case, \\((a + b)^4\\) only involves \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), while \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) involves \\(c\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be multiplied by every term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) has a coefficient, and when you multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), each of those coefficients becomes part of the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) in the product. Therefore, the total coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). As I calculated earlier, the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 64, so 6 times 64 is 384. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 384. Wait, but let me make sure. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, considering all possible terms, but that would still require knowing the coefficients of \\(c\\) terms. Wait, no, because \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term in the other polynomial, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is indeed the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that's not a number. Wait, no, that can't be right because coefficients are numerical. So, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, because that's the only term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\), which is 1. So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me check that. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) can be found using the binomial theorem. Each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We want the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which implies \\(k = 3\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product is 6 times 20, which is 120. So, perhaps that's the answer. Wait, but earlier I thought it was 384, but that was when considering all coefficients. But maybe the problem is specifically asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, but that would mean the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion, which isn't possible because the coefficient must be a number. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, so the term would be \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by some combination of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). But in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the coefficient of each corresponding \\(c\\) term, but that's not a single coefficient. So, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, without considering the \\(c\\) terms, which would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 64, giving 384. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and not considering the other part. But that seems unlikely because the problem includes the other part in the product. Hmm, I'm a bit confused. Let me try to clarify. The problem says: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum of the products of the coefficients of terms whose variables multiply to give that specific term. In this case, we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, that would mean that in the product, every term that has \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by any power of \\(c\\) would contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) has a coefficient, and when you multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), each of those coefficients becomes part of the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) in the product. Therefore, the total coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). As I calculated earlier, the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 64, so 6 times 64 is 384. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 384. But wait, earlier I thought that the problem might be asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. So, which is it? I think the confusion arises from whether the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\) or specifically \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). The problem says: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" It doesn't specify anything about \\(c\\), so I think it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, if the problem had said \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\)\", then it would be 120. So, I think the answer is 384. But let me check again. Let's consider the product \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When you expand this, each term will be of the form \\(a^{4 - k}b^k \\times c^{6 - m}(1/c)^m = a^{4 - k}b^k c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would come from \\(k = 2\\) in the first part, which gives \\(a^2b^2\\), and then multiplied by each term in the second part, which is \\(c^{6 - 2m}\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, that would be 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, it's 6 times the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. Therefore, the answer should be 384. But wait, I'm still a bit unsure because sometimes problems like this might expect you to consider the term where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out, i.e., \\(c^0\\). So, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). As I calculated earlier, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20, so 6 * 20 = 120. So, which is it? Let me read the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" It doesn't specify anything about \\(c\\), so I think it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), which would be 384. But to be thorough, let me consider both interpretations. If the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) irrespective of \\(c\\), then it's 384. If it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it's 120. Given that the problem didn't specify anything about \\(c\\), I think it's more likely that it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), so the answer is 384. But I'm still a bit unsure because sometimes in such problems, they expect you to consider the term where all variables are present, but in this case, since \\(c\\) is separate, I think the correct interpretation is that the coefficient is 384. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is written in a way that the entire expression is considered, and the \\(c\\) terms are just part of the expression, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the other part, which is 64, so 384. Therefore, I think the answer is 384.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break it down into two parts:\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term containing \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\), so the coefficient is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\n   \\]\n\n2. **Consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   The sum of all coefficients in this expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\):\n   \\[\n   \\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\n   \\]\n\n3. **Combine the results:**\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the product of the coefficients from each part:\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 64 = 384\n   \\]\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{384}\\)."

So, perhaps the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, that doesn't seem right because when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first polynomial multiplies each term in the second. But since I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), that means I need to find how many ways \\(a^2b^2\\) can be multiplied by terms that don't involve \\(c\\), or more precisely, terms that result in a constant term when considering the \\(c\\) part. Wait, no, that's not correct. Let me think again. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is a term like \\(a^{4 - k}b^k\\), and each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is a term like \\(c^{6 - m} \\times \\dfrac{1}{c^m} = c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, when you multiply them together, the terms would be \\(a^{4 - k}b^k \\times c^{6 - 2m}\\). Now, since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), that corresponds to \\(a^{2}b^{2}\\), so \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\), as I found earlier. So, in the first part, the coefficient is 6. Now, in the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\times \\dfrac{1}{c^m} = \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the exponent of \\(c\\) is \\(6 - 2m\\), where \\(m\\) ranges from 0 to 6. Now, since we are looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), we need to find the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. Because \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\) is just \\(a^2b^2\\). So, we need to find the value of \\(m\\) such that \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Let's solve for \\(m\\): \\(6 - 2m = 0\\) \u2192 \\(2m = 6\\) \u2192 \\(m = 3\\). So, the term where \\(m = 3\\) in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is the constant term, which is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} c^{0} = 20\\). Because \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Therefore, when we multiply the two parts together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the product of the coefficients from each part. So, that's 6 (from the \\(a^2b^2\\) term) multiplied by 20 (from the constant term in the \\(c\\) expansion). So, 6 \u00d7 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120. Wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake. So, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6. In \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the constant term is when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, which occurs at \\(m = 3\\), and the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, when you multiply the two, it's 6 \u00d7 20 = 120. So, that should be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression. I think that's correct. Wait, let me check again. Alternatively, maybe I can think of it as the product of the two expansions. So, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by all terms from the second part, but only the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero will contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). All other terms would have some power of \\(c\\), so when you multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), you get terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), which are different from \\(a^2b^2\\). So, only the constant term in the second expansion matters. So, that term is 20, so the coefficient is 6 \u00d7 20 = 120. Yeah, that makes sense. So, I think the coefficient is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is found by considering each part separately. \n\n1. **Expanding \\((a + b)^4\\)**:\n   - The term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\) in the binomial expansion.\n   - Coefficient: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n\n2. **Expanding \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)**:\n   - We seek the constant term (exponent of \\(c^0\\)), which occurs at \\(m = 3\\).\n   - Coefficient: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n\n3. **Combining the coefficients**:\n   - Multiply the coefficients from each expansion: \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

So, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) will multiply with the terms involving \\(c\\). But since the problem is only asking about \\(a^2b^2\\), the coefficient from the \\(c\\) part could be anything because it's multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, no. Actually, when you multiply two expressions together, each term in the first expression is multiplied by each term in the second expression. So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), that term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6a^2b^2. Now, when I multiply this by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in that expansion will multiply 6a^2b^2.

Wait, but \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), so any term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) will just multiply the 6a^2b^2, giving terms like 6a^2b^2c^k or 6a^2b^2c^{-k}, depending on the term. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, when I expand this, each term from \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I need to consider all the terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any term from the \\(c\\) expansion. But the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would include all the coefficients from the \\(c\\) expansion multiplied by 6. Wait, that doesn't make sense because the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would actually be 6 times the sum of all coefficients from the \\(c\\) expansion. But that can't be right because the \\(c\\) terms are separate variables. Wait, no. Let me clarify: the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product. So, \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term that comes from \\((a + b)^4\\), and when multiplied by any term from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), it becomes \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2c^{-k}\\), but the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would be the same as 6 times the sum of all coefficients from the \\(c\\) expansion. But wait, that's not correct because the \\(c\\) terms are separate. Wait, no, actually, when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in one part (like \\(a^2b^2\\)) is multiplied by all terms in the other part. But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, it's actually the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all coefficients from the second part. Because each term in the second part will contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when multiplied by 6a^2b^2. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Now, the sum of all coefficients in a polynomial is found by setting all variables to 1. So, if I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(1 + 1/1\\right)^6 = (2)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 64. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 * 64 = 384. Wait, but let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. Let me think again: when you have two polynomials multiplied together, say \\(P(a, b)\\) and \\(Q(c)\\), then the coefficient of a specific term in \\(P(a, b)\\), say \\(a^2b^2\\), when multiplied by \\(Q(c)\\), is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(P(a, b)\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(Q(c)\\). Because each term in \\(Q(c)\\) will multiply \\(a^2b^2\\), so the total contribution is the sum of coefficients in \\(Q(c)\\) times the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(P(a, b)\\). So, yes, that makes sense. So, in this case, \\(P(a, b) = (a + b)^4\\) and \\(Q(c) = \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(P(a, b)\\) is 6, and the sum of coefficients in \\(Q(c)\\) is 64, so the total coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 384. But wait, let me verify this another way. Alternatively, I can think of the entire expression as \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). If I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then it's the same as taking the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and multiplying it by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 64. So, 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, if the problem had asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), then I would have needed to find the specific coefficient in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) for \\(c^k\\), but since it's just \\(a^2b^2\\), I can consider all \\(c\\) terms. Therefore, I think 384 is the correct coefficient.\n\nWait, but let me check this again. Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, when you multiply two expressions, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\) with coefficient 6, and it's multiplied by every term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, each of these terms will have the form \\(c^k\\) or \\(c^{-k}\\), but since the problem is only asking for \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) part, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) will be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). As I calculated earlier, that sum is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. So, I think that's correct. Alternatively, if I were to expand \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) first, it would be \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\times (1/c)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). The sum of all coefficients in this expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 * 64 = 384. So, I think that's the correct answer.\n\nWait, but let me make sure. Another way to think about it is that when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a term in one polynomial is multiplied by all coefficients in the other polynomial. So, in this case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and when you multiply by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which has 64 as the sum of its coefficients, the total coefficient becomes 6 * 64 = 384. Yes, that makes sense. So, I'm confident that the coefficient is 384.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let me consider an example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^1 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, \\((a + b)(c + 1/c)\\). The coefficient of \\(a^1b^0\\) is 1, and the sum of coefficients in \\((c + 1/c)\\) is 2. So, the coefficient of \\(a\\) would be 1 * 2 = 2. Indeed, expanding \\((a + b)(c + 1/c)\\) gives \\(ac + a/c + bc + b/c\\). The coefficient of \\(a\\) is 2, which matches. Similarly, the coefficient of \\(b\\) is also 2. So, this method works. Therefore, applying it to the original problem, the coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nSo, after all that, I think the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 384.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{384}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem and properties of polynomial multiplication.\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\):\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\n   \\]\n   So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\n2. **Consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n   \\]\n   The sum of all coefficients in this expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\):\n   \\[\n   (1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\n   \\]\n\n3. **Combine the results:**\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 64 = 384\n   \\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{384}\\)."

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which would involve the product of the coefficients from both expansions. Wait, but I'm getting confused. Let me think again. Let me break it down. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when expanded, it's the product of two polynomials. Each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\) and is multiplied by every term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be \\(6 \\times\\) the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't seem right because the problem is asking for a coefficient, which is usually a number. So, perhaps I'm misinterpreting the problem. Maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out, leaving \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by 1. That is, the constant term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, if I can find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), then multiply that by 6, that would give me the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product. That makes more sense because the problem is likely asking for a numerical coefficient, not a polynomial. So, let's proceed with that approach. First, find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Again, using the binomial theorem, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, i.e., \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), \\(6 - 2k = 0 \\Rightarrow 2k = 6 \\Rightarrow k = 3\\). So, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). Therefore, the constant term is 20. Now, going back to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 (from \\((a + b)^4\\)) multiplied by 20 (the constant term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)), so 6 \u00d7 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120.\n\nWait, let me double-check that. So, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. In \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the constant term is 20. When you multiply these two parts together, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by the constant term 20, giving \\(6 \u00d7 20 = 120\\) as the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product. That seems correct. Alternatively, if I think about the entire expansion, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would come from the product of the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first part and the constant term in the second part, so yes, 6 \u00d7 20 = 120. I think that's the right answer.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplying it by the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20. Therefore, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\boxed{120}"

But wait, no, actually, that's not correct because when you multiply two expressions, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second. However, since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and the second expression doesn't have any \\(a\\) or \\(b\\) terms, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems a bit confusing. Wait, maybe I should think of it differently. Since the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), is being multiplied by the entire expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by every term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since we're only asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) will just contribute a scalar multiple to the coefficient. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be 6 multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that doesn't make sense because \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is a polynomial in \\(c\\), and when you multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would just be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that's not quite right because each term in the second expansion is a power of \\(c\\), so when you multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), each term becomes \\(a^2b^2\\) times a term in \\(c\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, the coefficient would just be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that's not correct because the sum of coefficients in a polynomial is found by setting all variables to 1. So, if I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) becomes \\((1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 * 64 = 384. Wait, but that seems too straightforward. Let me check again. Alternatively, maybe I should consider that when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each polynomial. But in this case, the first polynomial is in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the second is in \\(c\\), so they don't interfere with each other. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would indeed be the coefficient from the first part times the entire expansion of the second part, which is 6 * 64 = 384. Wait, but another way to think about it is that when you have \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\text{something}\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire \"something\", because \"something\" doesn't affect \\(a\\) or \\(b\\). So, yes, that makes sense. Therefore, the coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384. Hmm, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let me calculate \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) separately. Using the binomial theorem, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). The sum of all coefficients in this expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), so it's \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\), which confirms my earlier calculation. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6 * 64 = 384. Therefore, the final answer should be 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.

    "text": " Does that mean I don't need to consider the \\(c\\) terms? Or do I need to consider them? Wait, no, because the \\(c\\) terms are separate from \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), so when I multiply the two expressions together, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by every term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I think that means we're only concerned with the coefficient, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. Wait, no, that might not be the case. Let me think again. The problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, actually, the entire expression is a product of two binomials, each raised to a power. So, when I expand both, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of the second part. But since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term with only \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the second part has \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), which are different variables, the only way \\(a^2b^2\\) can appear in the product is when it's multiplied by the constant term (if any) from the second expansion. Wait, but \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) doesn't have a constant term unless the exponents of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) cancel out. Let me check that. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) will have terms of the form \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k\\), which simplifies to \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). For this to be a constant term, the exponent of \\(c\\) must be zero. So, \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\). So, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, when I multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first expansion by the constant term from the second expansion, I get \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't miss anything. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and since the second part has a constant term, that's the only term that will multiply with \\(a^2b^2\\) to give a term with \\(a^2b^2\\) and no \\(c\\) terms. If I had other terms in the second expansion, they would introduce \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\) factors, which would change the variables in the term. So, yes, only the constant term from the second expansion will contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, I think the coefficient is indeed 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.

Let me think about that. When I multiply two expressions together, each term in the first expression is multiplied by each term in the second expression. So, if I have \\((a + b)^4\\) times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).

Wait, no, that's not quite right. Actually, when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficients of the terms in the product are combinations of the coefficients from each polynomial. But in this case, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term is in \\((a + b)^4\\), and when multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), it will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), etc. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not \\(a^2b^2c^6\\) or anything else. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), because when you multiply by the other part, which involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), those terms will introduce other variables, but \\(a^2b^2\\) on its own won't be present except as part of the product. Wait, no, that's not correct either. Because when you multiply, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term is present in the first part, and when you multiply by 1 from the second part, it remains as \\(a^2b^2\\). But in the second part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the constant term (the term without \\(c\\)) is when the exponents of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) cancel out. So, perhaps the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by the constant term, you get \\(a^2b^2\\) times that constant, so the coefficient would be 6 times that constant term. So, I think that's the key. So, first, I found that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. Now, I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Then, multiply that by 6 to get the final coefficient. Let me work on that. So, the expression is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Again, I can use the binomial theorem to expand this. The binomial theorem says that \\((x + y)^n = \\sum_{k=0}^{n} \\dbinom{n}{k} x^{n - k} y^k\\). In this case, \\(x = c\\), \\(y = 1/c\\), and \\(n = 6\\). So, the expansion is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k\\). Let me simplify that. \\(\\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = c^{-k}\\), so the term becomes \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} c^{-k} = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). Now, I'm looking for the constant term, which is the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. So, I need to solve \\(6 - 2k = 0\\) for \\(k\\). Let's do that: \\(6 - 2k = 0\\) \u2192 \\(2k = 6\\) \u2192 \\(k = 3\\). So, the constant term is when \\(k = 3\\). So, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} c^{0} = \\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Let me compute that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20. Therefore, the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 20. Now, going back to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the constant term in the second part. So, that's 6 times 20, which is 120. Therefore, the coefficient is 120.\n\nWait, let me double-check that. So, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. In \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the constant term is 20. So, when I multiply these two expressions, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by the constant term 20 from the second part, giving \\(20a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient is indeed 20 times 6, which is 120. I think that makes sense. Alternatively, if I were to expand the entire expression, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term would only come from multiplying \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part by the constant term in the second part, because any other term in the second part would involve \\(c\\) raised to some power, which would make the term have \\(c\\) in it, not just \\(a^2b^2\\).

But wait, the sum of all coefficients in a polynomial is found by setting all variables to 1. So, if we set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(1 + 1/1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 * 64 = 384. Wait, but that seems too high.

As I calculated earlier, the sum of coefficients in the second part is 64. So, 6 * 64 = 384. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 384. Wait, but let me check that again. Alternatively, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Maybe the question is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where the exponents of \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are 2, 2, and 0 respectively. That would make sense because otherwise, the problem would be asking for a coefficient in a multivariable expression, but perhaps it's only considering the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) parts. Hmm, but the problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", without specifying anything about \\(c\\), so it's possible that it's considering all possible terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) appears, regardless of the power of \\(c\\). Therefore, in that case, the coefficient would indeed be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which is 64, giving 384. Alternatively, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then we would need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by \\(c^0\\), which would require a different approach.

Then, the coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nSecond interpretation: Coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\). In that case, we need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and multiply it by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part, which is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\), because in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term with \\(c^0\\) is when the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, which happens when we choose 3 terms of \\(c\\) and 3 terms of \\(1/c\\), so the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, the coefficient would be 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nBut which interpretation is correct? The problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", without mentioning \\(c\\). So, in the context of the entire expression, which includes \\(c\\), it's possible that the problem is considering \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by any power of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient would be the sum over all possible \\(c\\) terms multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). So, that would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which is 64, giving 384. But I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only considering the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) parts and ignoring \\(c\\), but that seems unlikely because \\(c\\) is part of the expression. Hmm, maybe I should check by expanding a bit more carefully.\n\nLet me consider the entire expression: \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). When expanded, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second part, which has terms like \\(c^6\\), \\(c^4\\), \\(c^2\\), \\(c^0\\), \\(c^{-2}\\), \\(c^{-4}\\), \\(c^{-6}\\), each with their own coefficients. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the sum of all these products. Since the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6, and each term in the second part has a coefficient, the total coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second part. As I calculated earlier, the sum of coefficients in the second part is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it's a different calculation. Let me check that.\n\nIn \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term with \\(c^0\\) is the middle term, which is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}c^3 \\times (1/c)^3 = \\dbinom{6}{3}c^0 = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Therefore, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it's 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nBut the problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", without specifying \\(c\\). So, perhaps it's the first interpretation, where we consider all possible powers of \\(c\\), making the coefficient 384. However, I'm not entirely sure because sometimes problems like this might implicitly assume that you're looking for the term where the exponents of all variables are zero except \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), but that's not standard. Typically, when you're asked for the coefficient of a specific term in a product, you consider the variables involved. Since \\(a^2b^2\\) is part of the product, and the other part involves \\(c\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) can be multiplied by any power of \\(c\\), so the coefficient would be the sum over all those possibilities, leading to 384.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, that means we're treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable and just looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which would indeed be 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which is 64, giving 384.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\), ignoring the second part, but that seems unlikely because the problem includes both parts.\n\nWait, no, the problem is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), so the entire expression is the product of these two. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire second part, because each term in the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the entire expansion of the second part, but since we're only interested in the coefficient, it's 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second part, which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem had specified a particular power of \\(c\\), like \\(c^0\\), then it would be different, but since it's not specified, I think the correct interpretation is that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 384.\n\nWait, but let me check with an example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^4 \\times (c + 1/c)^6\\). If I set \\(a = 1\\), \\(b = 1\\), \\(c = 1\\), then the entire expression would be \\((1 + 1)^4 \\times (1 + 1)^6 = 16 \\times 64 = 1024\\). The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 * 64 = 384, as calculated earlier. So, if I set \\(a = 1\\), \\(b = 1\\), \\(c = 1\\), the value is 1024, which is the sum of all coefficients. The sum of all coefficients in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 16, and in the second part, it's 64, so 16 * 64 = 1024. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 * 64 = 384, which is part of the total 1024. So, that seems consistent.\n\nTherefore, I think the correct answer is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplying it by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The sum of the coefficients in the second part is found by evaluating it at \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\(2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n\\boxed{384}"

Wait, but actually, when you multiply two expressions together, each term from the first expression is multiplied by each term from the second. But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), that term would come from taking \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part and the constant term (if any) from the second part, because if the second part has \\(c\\) terms, then the product would have terms involving \\(c\\), but since the problem is only about \\(a^2b^2\\), perhaps we just need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, and then multiply it by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part, which is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, let me check that. Let me expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem as well. So, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying that, it becomes \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m - m} = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). Now, the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero would be when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which implies \\(m = 3\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, the constant term in the second part is 20. Therefore, when I multiply the two expansions together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by 20 from the second part, giving a total coefficient of \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Wait, is that correct? Let me make sure I'm not missing anything. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 20. So, when I multiply the two expressions, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by the constant term 20 from the second part, resulting in 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120. Hmm, that seems right. But let me think again: when you multiply two polynomials, each term from the first is multiplied by each term from the second. So, to get \\(a^2b^2\\), you can only take the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part and the constant term from the second part because any other term involving \\(c\\) would add to the variables, but since we're only looking for \\(a^2b^2\\), the \\(c\\) terms don't matter as long as their exponents are zero. So, yes, I think that's correct. Therefore, the coefficient is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is found using the binomial coefficient \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). The constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying these together gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\(\\boxed{120}\\)"

So, when we multiply these out, each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), that term will be multiplied by all the terms from the second expansion.

Wait, but that doesn't seem right because the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, maybe the problem is treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable, and the term \\(a^2b^2\\) can be paired with any power of \\(c\\), so the coefficient would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of the coefficients of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think again. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, in the product, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), so the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part will be multiplied by all the terms in the second part, each contributing a different power of \\(c\\). But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\), then the coefficient would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, that makes sense because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, each term contributes a different power of \\(c\\), but the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the same as the coefficient in the first part times the sum of all coefficients in the second part. So, first, let's find the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The sum of coefficients is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), because that makes each term equal to its coefficient. So, substituting \\(c = 1\\), we get \\(\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = (2)^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of all coefficients in the second part is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 (from the first part) times 64 (sum of coefficients from the second part), which is 6 * 64 = 384. Wait, that seems too straightforward. Let me check if that's correct. Alternatively, maybe I should think of it differently. Since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\), then in the product, each term from \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part, each of which is of the form \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - k}\\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, each term in the second expansion is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\\) for \\(k = 0\\) to \\(6\\). Therefore, when we multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each of these terms, we get \\(a^2b^2 \\times \\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\\), which means that in the product, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the sum over all \\(k\\) of \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\dbinom{6}{k}\\), because \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) is the coefficient from the first part, and \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}\\) is the coefficient from the second part. Wait, but that would mean that the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} \\times \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k}\\). But \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} = 2^6 = 64\\), so that brings us back to 6 * 64 = 384. So, that seems consistent. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 384. Wait, but let me think again. Alternatively, maybe the problem is intended to have the term \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning that we're looking for the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\), so only the constant term in the second expansion. But the problem just says \\(a^2b^2\\), without specifying \\(c\\), so perhaps it's considering all terms with \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would indeed be the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all coefficients from the second part, which is 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, if the problem had specified a particular power of \\(c\\), say \\(c^0\\), then we would have to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion. But since it's not specified, I think the intended answer is 384. Let me just confirm this with another approach. Let's consider that when you multiply two expressions, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum of the products of coefficients from each expression that combine to form that term. In this case, since \\(a^2b^2\\) is only from the first expression, and the second expression contributes any term, the coefficient would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expression times the sum of all coefficients in the second expression, which is 6 * 64 = 384. So, I think that's correct. Therefore, the coefficient is 384.\n\nWait, but let me check again because I might have made a mistake. Let me think: \\((a + b)^4\\) gives \\(a^2b^2\\) with coefficient 6. The other part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), when expanded, has terms like \\(c^6\\), \\(6c^4\\), \\(15c^2\\), \\(20c^0\\), \\(15c^{-2}\\), \\(6c^{-4}\\), \\(c^{-6}\\). So, the sum of the coefficients is 64, as before. So, when we multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each of these terms, each term contributes its coefficient, so the total coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) across all possible \\(c\\) terms is 6 times 64, which is 384. So, yeah, that seems correct.\n\nWait, but another way to think about it is that the entire expression is a product of two polynomials. So, when you multiply them, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial is multiplied by every term in the second polynomial. Each of these products will contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, because \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by terms that only involve \\(c\\), which don't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) exponents. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 6 * 64 = 384. So, that makes sense.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem had been asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then we would have to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part, which is 20, because in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the constant term is when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. Let me calculate that: the general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, in that case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) would be 6 * 20 = 120. But since the problem didn't specify \\(c^0\\), I think it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), so that would be 384. So, I think my initial answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n\\boxed{384}"

Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, considering all the \\(c\\) terms as well.

But that seems a bit off. Alternatively, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" Hmm, so maybe it's just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. So, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when considering the entire expression, regardless of \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but the sum of all coefficients in a polynomial can be found by setting all variables to 1. So, if I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = (1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times 64, which is 384. But wait, let me make sure. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the entire expression as a product, and the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be 6, because the other part doesn't affect it.

As I thought earlier, the sum of coefficients in the \\(c\\) expansion is 64, so 6 times 64 is 384. But wait, let me check that again. Alternatively, maybe the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of the power of \\(c\\), which would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion, but that would make it a polynomial in \\(c\\), not a numerical coefficient.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm supposed to consider that the entire product is a single expression, and the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the expansion of the \\(c\\) part, but that would still be a polynomial in \\(c\\), not a number. So, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me think again. Wait, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in the \\(c\\) expansion, which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only considering the part of the expansion where \\(c\\) is raised to a specific power, but the problem doesn't specify, so I think it's safe to assume that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the \\(c\\) expansion, which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me double-check that. Alternatively, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, not a number. So, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), that is, the term where \\(c\\) cancels out, so the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. That would make sense because then the coefficient would be a number. So, perhaps I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product, which would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, let's try that approach.\n\nFirst, find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). To do this, I can use the binomial theorem again. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We want the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\). So, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire product is 6 (from the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in \\((a + b)^4\\)) multiplied by 20 (from the \\(c^0\\) term in the other expansion). So, 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient is 120.\n\nWait, that makes more sense. So, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, which would require the exponent of \\(c\\) to be zero because otherwise, the term would involve \\(c\\) to some power, and the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which I think implies that \\(c\\) is not involved, so the exponent of \\(c\\) must be zero. Therefore, the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nLet me recap to make sure I didn't make a mistake. First, I expanded \\((a + b)^4\\) and found the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. Then, I considered the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) and found the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Multiplying these together gives 6 * 20 = 120. That seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, if I didn't consider the \\(c^0\\) term and just multiplied 6 by the entire expansion, I would get a polynomial in \\(c\\), but the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, so it must be 120.\n\nI think that's the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6. Next, we find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20. Multiplying these together gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\boxed{120}"

    "text": " So, maybe I don't need to worry about the terms involving \\(c\\) because \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\). Hmm, but actually, when we multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the terms will multiply together. So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I need to consider how many times \\(a^2b^2\\) appears when multiplied by any term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term in \\((a + b)^4\\), and we're multiplying by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would just be 6 times the sum of the coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but since we're multiplying by 1 (as \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term without \\(c\\)), maybe the coefficient remains 6. Wait, that seems too straightforward. Let me think again. Actually, when you multiply two expressions, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression. So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I need to consider all the terms in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) that, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), result in a term that includes \\(a^2b^2\\). But wait, \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), so when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by any term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the result will have \\(a^2b^2\\) times some power of \\(c\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) itself won't be present unless we're considering the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because if you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by \\(c^0\\) (which is 1), you get \\(a^2b^2\\). All other terms would have \\(c\\) raised to some power, which would make the term \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) where \\(k\\) is not zero. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, now I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem. The expansion is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying each term, that becomes \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m - m} = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We're looking for the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so we set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Therefore, going back to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 (from \\((a + b)^4\\)) multiplied by 20 (from the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)). So, 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake here. So, the key idea is that when you multiply two expressions, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum of the products of the coefficients of terms whose exponents add up to the desired term. In this case, since we're looking for \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), we need to find the term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) that doesn't involve \\(c\\) either, which is the constant term. So, that part seems correct. And we found that the constant term is 20, so multiplying by 6 gives 120. I think that's right.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of it as the entire expression being a product of two independent binomial expansions. So, \\((a + b)^4\\) contributes 6 for \\(a^2b^2\\), and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) contributes 20 for the constant term, so their product gives 120 for \\(a^2b^2\\) times 1. That makes sense.\n\nI don't think I made any mistakes in the calculations. The binomial coefficients were calculated correctly, and the exponents were handled properly. So, I think the answer is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplying it by the constant term (coefficient of \\(c^0\\)) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20. Thus, the final coefficient is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\boxed{120}"

Because it's a separate variable, so when you multiply two expressions, the coefficients multiply, but in this case, since we're only looking for \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), the coefficient from the \\(c\\) terms doesn't matter. Wait, but actually, no. Let me think again. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when you multiply these two expressions, each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), that would only come from the product of the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in \\((a + b)^4\\) and the constant term (i.e., the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because if you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by any term involving \\(c\\), the result will have \\(c\\) terms, which aren't part of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), then multiply it by the coefficient 6 from the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. Let me calculate that. So, first, let's find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Again, using the binomial theorem: \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying each term, that's \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m} = \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We want the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\) so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\), which is \\(\\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) and the constant term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). That would be \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Wait, is that correct? Let me double-check. So, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. In \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the constant term is 20. So, when we multiply these two expansions together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, but only the constant term (20) will result in a term that's \\(a^2b^2 \\times 1\\), which is just \\(a^2b^2\\). All other terms would have \\(c\\) raised to some power, so they wouldn't contribute to the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. Therefore, the coefficient is indeed 6 times 20, which is 120. Hmm, that seems right. Let me just make sure I didn't make any calculation errors. So, \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\), that's correct. \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\), that's also correct. 6 times 20 is 120, yes.

Wait, but that would be 6 times \\(2^6 = 64\\), but that's not correct because the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is when \\(c = 1\\), so \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, maybe the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 * 64 = 384. But that seems too high. Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it.

Wait, no, because the second part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is not a constant. So, I'm confused. Let me try to think differently. Maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning that the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. Because if we're looking for a term that has \\(a^2b^2\\) and \\(c^0\\), then the coefficient would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). That makes more sense. So, let me check that approach. So, first, find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6. Then, find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because when you multiply the two, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\) would be \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is the middle term, which occurs when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. Using the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, we need the exponent \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which implies \\(k = 3\\). So, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 * 20 = 120. That seems reasonable. Let me double-check. So, \\((a + b)^4\\) has \\(a^2b^2\\) with coefficient 6. \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) has \\(c^0\\) term with coefficient 20. So, when you multiply the two, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by 20, giving a total coefficient of 6 * 20 = 120. Yeah, that makes sense. So, the final answer should be 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplying it by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20. Thus, the final coefficient is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\boxed{120}"

    "text": " So, does that mean I don't need to consider the terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) in this case? Because \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), right? So, maybe I can treat \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) as a separate part, but since I'm only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), perhaps the other part doesn't affect it. Wait, but actually, when you multiply two expressions together, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression. But since I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't have any \\(c\\) terms, I think that part would come from multiplying the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in \\((a + b)^4\\) by the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because if I multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by any term involving \\(c\\), the result would have \\(c\\) terms, which we don't want. So, I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), and then multiply it by the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which we found to be 6. So, let me try to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Again, I can use the binomial theorem here. The expansion is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying that, each term becomes \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\cdot c^{-m} = \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). Now, I need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be zero because that's the constant term. So, I set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is when \\(m = 3\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Let me compute that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20. Now, putting it all together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficients from each part. That is, 6 (from \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\)) multiplied by 20 (the constant term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)). So, 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120.\n\nWait, let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes here. First, in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). That seems correct. Then, for \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), I found the constant term by setting the exponent of \\(c\\) to zero, which gave me \\(m = 3\\), and the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). That also seems correct. Multiplying these together gives 6 * 20 = 120. So, yeah, I think that's right. I don't think I made any calculation errors here. So, the final answer should be 120.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break down the problem as follows:\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term with \\(a^2b^2\\) occurs when \\(k = 2\\):\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} a^{2}b^{2} = 6a^2b^2\n   \\]\n   So, the coefficient is 6.\n\n2. **Find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n   \\]\n   The constant term occurs when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which gives \\(m = 3\\):\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{6}{3} c^{0} = 20\n   \\]\n   So, the constant term is 20.\n\n3. **Multiply the coefficients:**\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the two coefficients:\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 20 = 120\n   \\]\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

    "text": " That means I don't need to worry about the terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), right? Because when I multiply the two expressions together, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will come from the product of the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in \\((a + b)^4\\) and the constant term (if any) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, actually, no. Let me think again. Because when I multiply two polynomials, each term from the first polynomial is multiplied by each term from the second polynomial. But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), it's possible that any term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) will just be a constant factor when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). But wait, actually, no. Because \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) are separate variables, so when you expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term will have some power of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), but since the problem is only asking about the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\), that term's coefficient will just be multiplied by whatever the constant term is in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, that doesn't sound right. Let me clarify. The expression is \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when you multiply these two, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first part will be multiplied by every term in the second part. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which means that we need to consider all the terms that result in \\(a^2b^2\\) when multiplied by terms from the second expansion. However, the second expansion only involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), so when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by any term from the second expansion, you'll get something like \\(a^2b^2 \\times c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2 \\times c^{-k}\\), but the \\(a^2b^2\\) part remains the same. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because each term in the second expansion will just add a factor to the coefficient. Wait, no. That doesn't make sense because the second expansion is multiplied by the first, so the \\(a^2b^2\\) term's coefficient will be multiplied by every term in the second expansion, but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), we actually need to find the sum of all the coefficients in the second expansion, because when you multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), each term in the second expansion will contribute to a term like \\(a^2b^2 c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2 c^{-k}\\), but the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) itself, without any \\(c\\) terms, would only come from the constant term in the second expansion. Wait, that might be it. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is equal to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by the constant term (which is when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero), you get a term with \\(a^2b^2\\) and no \\(c\\) terms. Any other term from the second expansion would have a \\(c^k\\) or \\(c^{-k}\\) term, which would make the term have \\(c\\) in it, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) would only come from multiplying by the constant term. So, first, let me find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which we already found as 6. Then, I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). How do I find the constant term? Well, again, using the binomial theorem. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). The constant term is when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, so we set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Wait, but let me double-check that. So, the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the constant term from the other expansion is 20. Multiplying them gives 120. So, that should be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Hmm, that seems right. Alternatively, maybe I can think of it as the product of the two expansions: \\((a + b)^4\\) times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first part, and the constant term from the second part. So, yes, 6 times 20 is 120.

    "text": " So, does that mean I need to consider the entire expression? Or is the part with \\(c\\) irrelevant because we're only looking for \\(a^2b^2\\)? Hmm, that's a good question. Let me think. Since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and the other part of the expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which involves \\(c\\) terms, but \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) don't appear in that part. So, maybe the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, no, that can't be right because when you multiply two expressions, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), we can consider the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) and multiply it by the sum of all coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that seems complicated. Alternatively, maybe the part with \\(c\\) doesn't affect the \\(a^2b^2\\) term because it's multiplied by terms that don't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\). So, perhaps the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) would be when we set \\(c = 1\\), right? Because substituting \\(c = 1\\) would make each term just the coefficient times 1, so the sum would be the sum of the coefficients. Let me check that. If I substitute \\(c = 1\\) into \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), I get \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of all coefficients in that part is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 (from \\((a + b)^4\\)) multiplied by 64, which is 384. Wait, that seems high. Let me make sure I'm thinking correctly. Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and the other part of the product is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial in \\(c\\), but when we multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), the \\(c\\) terms will just tag along, but the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) would include all the coefficients from the \\(c\\) part. Wait, no, that's not right because each term in the product is a term from the first expansion times a term from the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part would be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), that would mean that we're only considering the terms where the \\(c\\) part is \\(c^0\\), i.e., the constant term. Because any other term would have a \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\) factor, making it not a pure \\(a^2b^2\\) term. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). That makes more sense. So, I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me figure that out. To find the constant term, I can again use the binomial theorem. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). The constant term is when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). So, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Let me compute that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (the constant term from the second part), which is 6 * 20 = 120. Wait, that seems different from my earlier thought. Let me double-check. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then it's multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term without any \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), the only contribution comes from the constant term in the second expansion. So, that's 20. Therefore, 6 * 20 = 120. So, the coefficient is 120. Wait, but earlier I thought it was 384, but that was when I considered the sum of all coefficients, which is 64. But that would be if I were looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some \\(k\\), but since we're only looking for \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\), but actually, no, because the problem is written as \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), so when you multiply them, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part would be multiplied by all the terms in the second part, but only the constant term would give a term without any \\(c\\), so the coefficient would be 6 * 20 = 120. Alternatively, if the problem had been to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), then you'd have to consider the term where \\(c^k\\) is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), but since the problem is just \\(a^2b^2\\), I think it's only the constant term in the second part that contributes. So, I think the correct coefficient is 120. Let me confirm this by expanding both parts. First, \\((a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6. Now, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Let's expand that: The expansion is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} (1/c)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). The constant term is when \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), so \\(k = 3\\), which gives \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20. Therefore, when we multiply the two expansions, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by the constant term 20 from the second part, giving 6 * 20 = 120.
