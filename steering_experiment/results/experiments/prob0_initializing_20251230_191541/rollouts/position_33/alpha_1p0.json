Wait, no, that would give me \\(6 - m = 0\\) when \\(m = 6\\), but let me check: when \\(m = 6\\), the exponent is \\(6 - 6 = 0\\). So, the term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{6} c^0\\), which is 1. So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{6} = 1\\). Wait, but that seems a bit off because when \\(m = 3\\), the exponent would be \\(6 - 3 = 3\\), but that's not 0. Wait, let me re-examine. The exponent is \\(6 - m\\) minus \\(m\\) because \\(\\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = c^{-m}\\), so the total exponent is \\(6 - m - m = 6 - 2m\\). So, I set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which gives \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Oh, I see, I made a mistake earlier.

We want this exponent to be 0, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the term where \\(m = 3\\) is the constant term. So, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Now, going back to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the two coefficients I found: 6 (from \\((a + b)^4\\)) and 20 (from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)). So, 6 multiplied by 20 is 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 120. Wait, let me just make sure I didn't make a mistake here. So, the key idea is that when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each polynomial. But in this case, the first polynomial is in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the second is in \\(c\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), so it can only come from the product of the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first polynomial and the constant term in the second polynomial. That makes sense because if you take any other term from the second polynomial, it would have a \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\) factor, which would make the product term include \\(c\\), which isn't part of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, yes, I think that's correct. So, the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120. I think that's the answer. Let me just recap to make sure I didn't skip any steps or make any calculation errors. First, expand \\((a + b)^4\\) and find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Then, expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) and find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\), which occurs when the exponent \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), so \\(m = 3\\), and the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiply these together: 6 * 20 = 120. Yep, that seems right. I don't think I made any mistakes here. So, the coefficient is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), then multiplying these coefficients together.\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\):**\n   Using the binomial theorem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n\n2. **Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   The constant term (where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0) occurs when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), giving \\(m = 3\\).
