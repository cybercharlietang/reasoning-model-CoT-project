So, 6 times 20 is 120. Therefore, the coefficient should be 120. Wait, but let me think again. The problem is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, when expanding, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) will multiply each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part will multiply all terms in the second part, but only the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero will contribute to the term without any \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), which is what we want for \\(a^2b^2\\). So, that's why we only need to consider the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part. Therefore, the coefficient is 6 times 20, which is 120. I think that's correct. Alternatively, maybe I can think of the entire expression as a product of two polynomials and consider that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the product of the coefficients of \\(a^2b^2\\) in each part, but since the second part doesn't affect \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), it's just the product of the coefficients. Wait, no, that's not quite right. Actually, when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficients of the product are convolutions of the coefficients of the individual polynomials. But in this case, since one polynomial is in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) and the other is in \\(c\\), the variables are independent. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial multiplied by the entire second polynomial. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term without any \\(c\\), we have to find the part of the second polynomial that doesn't involve \\(c\\), which is the constant term, which we found as 20. So, yes, the coefficient is 6 times 20, which is 120. I think that's solid. So, the final answer is 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem.\n\nFirst, we expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n\\]\nThe term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\), so the coefficient is:\n\\[\n\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\n\\]\n\nNext, we consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):\n\\[\n\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n\\]\nWe need the coefficient of the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0.

Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Let me compute that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Now, going back to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Therefore, when we multiply these two polynomials together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) (since it's multiplied by \\(c^0\\)) is 6 * 20 = 120. Wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake here. So, when I expand \\((a + b)^4\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) has a coefficient of 6, and when I expand \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term with \\(c^0\\) has a coefficient of 20. Since these two terms are multiplied together in the product, the overall coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120. That seems right. Alternatively, I can think of the entire expression as \\((a + b)^4\\) times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). When I multiply them, each term from \\((a + b)^4\\) will multiply each term from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But since we're only interested in the term that results in \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), that means we have to take the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first polynomial and the constant term (in \\(c\\)) from the second polynomial. So, yes, that would be 6 * 20 = 120. I think that makes sense. So, the coefficient is 120. Let me just double-check my steps to make sure I didn't skip anything or make a calculation error. First, binomial expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\): correct, and finding the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6. Then, for \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), using the binomial theorem, the term with \\(c^0\\) is when the exponent is zero, which happens at \\(m = 3\\), so \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying 6 and 20 gives 120. Yeah, that seems correct. So, I think the coefficient is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20.
