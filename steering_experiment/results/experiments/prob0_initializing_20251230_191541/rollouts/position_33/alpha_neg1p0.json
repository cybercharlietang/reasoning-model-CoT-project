    "text": " So, the exponent of \\(c\\) in each term is \\(6 - 2m\\). We want the term where the exponent is 0, so we set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(6 = 2m\\) => \\(m = 3\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Let me calculate that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Now, putting it all together: the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part is 20. Since these two terms are multiplied together in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the overall coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 * 20 = 120. Wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake. So, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, and in the other polynomial, the term with \\(c^0\\) is 20. So, when you multiply these two parts, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first polynomial is multiplied by the constant term 20 from the second polynomial, giving 6 * 20 = 120. That seems right. Alternatively, I can think of it as the entire product being the product of two polynomials, so the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) is the product of the coefficients of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and the constant term in the second part. So, yes, 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is 120.\n\nWait, hold on, let me double-check. Maybe I should consider whether there are other terms in the second polynomial that could contribute to the \\(a^2b^2\\) term when multiplied. But no, because the second polynomial only has terms with \\(c\\), and the first polynomial has terms with \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). So, when you multiply them, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term can only come from multiplying \\(a^2b^2\\) with the constant term in the second polynomial. There's no other way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms. So, I think my reasoning is correct. Therefore, the coefficient is indeed 120.\n\nAnother way to think about it: when you expand the entire expression, each term will be of the form \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k \\times \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, to get a term with \\(a^2b^2\\), you need \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). So, the coefficient from the first part is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Then, for the second part, you need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be 0, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\) => \\(m = 3\\). The coefficient from the second part is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, the total coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120. Yep, that's consistent with what I found earlier.\n\nI think that's solid. So, the final answer should be 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem.\n\nFirst, consider the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n\\]\nWe need the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2, which corresponds to \\(k = 2\\). The coefficient for this term is:\n\\[\n\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\n\\]\n\nNext, consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem:\n\\[\n\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n\\]\nWe need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, which occurs when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\).

Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Let me compute that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20.

Therefore, when we multiply these two parts together, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) (since the \\(c\\) terms cancel out to give a constant term) is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Wait, let me double-check that. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\) as 6a\u00b2b\u00b2, and the term \\(c^0\\) comes from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) as 20. So, when you multiply these two, you get 6 * 20 * a\u00b2b\u00b2 * c^0, which is 120a\u00b2b\u00b2. So, the coefficient is indeed 120. Hmm, does that make sense? Let me think again. Alternatively, maybe I should consider the entire expansion. Let me write out the two expansions:\n\nFirst, \\((a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\).\n\nSecond, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15/c^2 + 6/c^4 + 1/c^6\\).\n\nNow, when you multiply these two expressions together, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. So, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term is 6a\u00b2b\u00b2, and it's multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), we need to find all the terms in the product that result in \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\). That is, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term multiplied by the constant term (20) in the second polynomial. So, 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient is 120. So, I think that's correct. Alternatively, if I were to consider other terms, like maybe \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by \\(c^6\\) or \\(c^{-6}\\), those would give terms with \\(a^2b^2c^6\\) or \\(a^2b^2/c^6\\), but since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), those terms don't contribute to that specific term. So, the only contribution is from the constant term in the second polynomial. Therefore, the coefficient is indeed 120.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not missing something. Is there a possibility that other terms in the expansion could contribute to \\(a^2b^2\\) when multiplied by some \\(c\\) terms? No, because \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term with only \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), so any \\(c\\) terms would introduce \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\) into the term, making it not just \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, only the constant term (with \\(c^0\\)) in the second polynomial contributes to the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. So, yes, 120 is the correct coefficient.\n\nI think that's solid.

Alternatively, I could think of the entire expression as a product of two polynomials and recognize that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is only affected by the terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any term from the second polynomial, but since the second polynomial doesn't have \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) is by taking the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first polynomial and multiplying it by the constant term from the second polynomial. That confirms my earlier reasoning.
