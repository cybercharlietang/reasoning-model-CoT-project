    "text": " Wait, no, actually, when you multiply two expressions, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression. But since we're only interested in terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) appears, and \\(c\\) is in the other part, maybe those terms don't affect the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. Wait, no, that doesn't make sense. Because the entire expression is a product of \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), so each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since we're looking for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, and the other part involves \\(c\\), which doesn't contain \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but actually, no, because when you multiply, the terms with \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part are multiplied by the entire second part, which includes terms with \\(c\\), but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), the \\(c\\) terms don't affect the exponent of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) will multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term, contributing their coefficients. Wait, but that doesn't sound quite right. Let me think again. When you have two polynomials multiplied together, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum of the products of the coefficients of terms in each polynomial whose exponents add up to the desired term. But in this case, since the first polynomial is in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the second is in \\(c\\), the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) don't interact with the exponents of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, that can't be because the product would have terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) where \\(k\\) varies. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), so the \\(a^2b^2\\) term is multiplied by every term in the second expansion, and since we're just looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, we have to sum all those contributions. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 (from \\((a + b)^4\\)) multiplied by the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Now, the sum of the coefficients in a polynomial is found by plugging in 1 for all variables. So, for \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the sum of coefficients would be when \\(c = 1\\), so \\(\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of the coefficients is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 * 64 = 384. Wait, that seems high. Let me check again. Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and the other part is in terms of \\(c\\), which doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), maybe the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is simply the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But no, that would mean the coefficient is 6 times 64, which is 384, but that doesn't seem right because when you multiply two expressions, the coefficients don't just multiply like that. Wait, no, actually, when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Because each term in the second part is a constant with respect to \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), so when you multiply, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second part, which is 64, so 6*64=384. But let me think again: when you have \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first part, and it's multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is indeed 6 multiplied by the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64. So, 6*64=384. Therefore, the coefficient is 384. But wait, let me verify this with another approach. Alternatively, maybe I can consider that the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), because each term in the second expansion will multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term, contributing their coefficients. So, since the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 64, as calculated before, then the total coefficient is 6*64=384. Alternatively, perhaps I can think of it as the product of two independent expansions, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the coefficient from the first part times the sum of the coefficients from the second part. That seems consistent. So, I think 384 is the correct answer. Wait, but let me check with specific terms. Let's say I expand \\((a + b)^4\\) to get \\(a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6. Now, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) can be expanded as \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\times (1/c)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\) for \\(k = 0\\) to \\(6\\). So, the sum of the coefficients is when \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} = 2^6 = 64\\), as before. Therefore, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6*64=384. Therefore, the coefficient is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(2^6 = 64\\). Multiplying these together gives \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n\\boxed{384}"

But wait, the sum of the coefficients in a polynomial is found by plugging in 1 for all variables. So, if I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = (2)^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of the coefficients is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times 64, which is 384. Wait, but that seems too high. Let me think again. Maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Alternatively, perhaps the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just 6, because the other part doesn't affect it since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\). But that doesn't seem right either because when you multiply two expressions, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second, but the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, perhaps the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expression, which is 64, making it 6 * 64 = 384. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe I'm supposed to treat the entire expression as a product and find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), because \\(a^2b^2\\) times any power of \\(c\\) would still be \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), but the problem just asks for \\(a^2b^2\\), so maybe it's the sum of all coefficients where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. Wait, that's possible. So, in that case, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), and then multiply it by 6. So, let's compute that. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We want the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which implies \\(k = 3\\). So, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 * 20 = 120. Hmm, that seems more reasonable. So, I think I made a mistake earlier by considering the sum of all coefficients, but actually, since we want \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms, we need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, which is 20, and then multiply by 6, giving 120. Let me check that again. So, \\((a + b)^4\\) gives a term \\(a^2b^2\\) with coefficient 6. \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) has a term \\(c^0\\) with coefficient 20. So, when you multiply these two expressions, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in the second expression, but since we're only interested in \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), we take the coefficient from the second expression where \\(c^0\\), which is 20, and multiply by 6, giving 120. Yeah, that makes sense. So, the coefficient is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. In \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Multiplying these gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\boxed{120}."

Let me check again: It says, \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, perhaps the problem is considering \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\) as variables, and it's asking for the coefficient of the term \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). That is, we're to treat \\(c\\) as another variable, and find the coefficient of the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) appears, regardless of the exponent on \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but that would make the coefficient a sum involving terms from the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\).

So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that seems too broad because the coefficient would then be a sum involving various powers of \\(c\\). Alternatively, maybe the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which would involve considering all the terms from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), but that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense for a numerical coefficient.

Maybe the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which would be 6 times the sum of all terms in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't make sense because the coefficient would then be a function of \\(c\\), which isn't what the problem is asking for.

But that's not possible because \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is a polynomial, not a scalar.

But since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would indeed be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that seems too complicated, and I don't think that's what the problem is asking. Maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me try another approach. Perhaps the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then the \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) part is irrelevant because it doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\). But that can't be right because the problem includes both parts. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, which would be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) would be found by setting \\(c = 1\\). Let me check that: If I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times 64, which is 384. Wait, that seems plausible. Let me see: When you have a product of two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each polynomial. But in this case, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) only comes from \\((a + b)^4\\), so its coefficient is 6, and since \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is multiplied by that, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would indeed be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But the sum of coefficients is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. That seems to make sense. Alternatively, another way to think about it is that when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a term in one polynomial is multiplied by the entire other polynomial. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which, when considered as a coefficient, would involve all the terms. But since the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, perhaps it's considering that the coefficient is a scalar, which would be the case if we're treating \\(c\\) as a variable separate from \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). Wait, but that doesn't seem right. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, which would involve terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for various \\(k\\), but the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial. But the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, which suggests that perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem.\n\nWait, maybe I should consider that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating \\(c\\) as a variable, so the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem says \"the coefficient,\" which implies a numerical value, not a polynomial. So, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it, and the problem is simply to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then note that the \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) part doesn't affect it because \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables. But that doesn't seem right because the problem includes both parts, so the coefficient should be multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. Hmm, this is confusing. Let me try to clarify. When you have two polynomials multiplied together, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each polynomial. But in this case, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) only comes from the first polynomial, so its coefficient in the product would be 6 times the entire second polynomial, which is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is \\(6 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that's a polynomial, not a single number. Therefore, perhaps the problem is miswritten, or I'm misinterpreting it. Alternatively, maybe the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, considering that the second part is raised to the 6th power, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating \\(c\\) as a variable, but that would require expressing the coefficient as a polynomial in \\(c\\), which isn't a numerical coefficient. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, and then evaluate it at a specific value of \\(c\\), but the problem doesn't specify that. I'm stuck. Let me try another approach. Maybe I should expand both parts separately and then find the coefficient. So, first, \\((a + b)^4\\) expanded is:\n\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\n\\]\n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. Now, the other part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let's expand that using the binomial theorem:\n\n\\[\n\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n\\]\n\nSo, the expansion will have terms from \\(c^6\\) down to \\(c^{-6}\\) in steps of 2. Now, when we multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second part. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product will be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), because \\(a^2b^2\\) is being multiplied by every term in the second polynomial. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is \\(6 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient, which is a numerical value, so perhaps I'm missing something. Alternatively, maybe the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating \\(c\\) as a variable, which would make the coefficient a polynomial in \\(c\\). But that doesn't seem right because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, and then evaluate it at a specific value of \\(c\\), but the problem doesn't specify that. Alternatively, maybe the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of the power of \\(c\\), which would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). The sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). That seems plausible. Let me check: If I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = 64\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 * 64 = 384. Therefore, the coefficient is 384. Alternatively, another way to think about it is that when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each polynomial. But in this case, since \\(a^2b^2\\) only comes from the first polynomial, the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of the second polynomial. But if we're considering the coefficient as a scalar, perhaps it's more accurate to say that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 6 * 64 = 384. So, I think that's the answer.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is found by first determining the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplying it by the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 64 when \\(c = 1\\). Thus, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\boxed{384}."

But that would mean the coefficient is 6 times whatever the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is. Wait, but that can't be right because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term without \\(c\\). So, actually, when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the only way to get a term without \\(c\\) is if the exponents of \\(c\\) in each term cancel out. So, in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term is of the form \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, the exponent of \\(c\\) is \\(6 - 2k\\). To have \\(c^0\\), which is 1, we need \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), so \\(2k = 6\\), which means \\(k = 3\\). So, the term where \\(k = 3\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} c^{0} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, that's 6 times 20, which is 120. Wait, but let me double-check that. So, \\((a + b)^4\\) has \\(a^2b^2\\) with coefficient 6, and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) has a term with \\(c^0\\) which is 20. So, when you multiply these two parts together, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part gets multiplied by the 20 from the second part, so the coefficient becomes 6 * 20 = 120. Hmm, that seems correct. Let me verify the binomial coefficients again. For \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). For \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out is when \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), so \\(k = 3\\), and \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, 6 * 20 = 120.

Wait, but since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term from \\((a + b)^4\\), and the other part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is separate, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. But that doesn't make sense because the second part is not a constant, it's another expression. Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are only in the first part, the second part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), so when you multiply them together, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems too big, because the problem is asking for a specific coefficient, so perhaps I'm misunderstanding something. Wait, maybe I'm supposed to consider that the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), and we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, in that case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the same as the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because when you multiply, each term from \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, no, that doesn't make sense. Because each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) has a coefficient, and when you multiply by 6, it's 6 times each of those coefficients, but that's not right because each term from \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term from the other expansion. Wait, no, actually, since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and that term doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that's not correct because the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) includes terms with different powers of \\(c\\), but when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), each of those would contribute to different terms in the final expansion. Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think again. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when you expand this, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from \\((a + b)^4\\) would be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that can't be right because the coefficient would then be a sum of terms involving \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which I think refers to the coefficient regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. Wait, maybe I'm misinterpreting the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)\". So, perhaps the problem is considering the entire expression as a polynomial in \\(a, b, c, 1/c\\), and it's asking for the coefficient of the term \\(a^2b^2\\), which would be multiplied by some combination of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). But that seems more complicated. Alternatively, maybe the problem is only considering the part with \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the rest is just a constant factor. Wait, no, that doesn't make sense because \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is a separate expression. Maybe I need to consider that the entire expression is a product, and we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which would involve multiplying the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which doesn't make sense because a coefficient should be a number, not an expression in \\(c\\). So, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Wait, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when considering the entire expression as a product, but without considering the \\(c\\) terms. That is, perhaps the coefficient is just 6, because the \\(c\\) terms are separate. But that seems unlikely because the problem includes both \\(a, b\\) and \\(c\\). Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which would involve the product of the coefficients from both expansions. Wait, but \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) are being multiplied, so when you expand the product, each term is a product of a term from the first expansion and a term from the second. So, to get \\(a^2b^2\\), you need to take the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion and multiply it by every term from the second expansion. So, the coefficient would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. But that would mean the coefficient is 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which again is an expression, not a number. So, perhaps I'm missing something. Wait, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when the entire expression is considered as a polynomial in \\(a, b, c\\), but without considering the \\(c\\) terms. That is, perhaps it's just the coefficient from the first part, 6, and the second part is a separate factor. But that doesn't seem right because the problem is written as a product. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, considering all possible terms, including those with \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that's still an expression. Alternatively, maybe the problem is only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which would mean that the coefficient is 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) would be when \\(c = 1\\), so substituting \\(c = 1\\), we get \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, if I take 6 times 64, that would be 384. But I'm not sure if that's the right approach. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it, and the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and the second part is irrelevant because it doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. But that seems too simplistic. Wait, let me think differently. When you have two separate expressions multiplied together, like \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the terms in the product are the products of terms from each expression. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from \\((a + b)^4\\), and it's multiplied by every term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expression multiplied by the entire expansion of the second expression. But that would mean the coefficient is 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is not a number but a polynomial. So, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable, which would mean that the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But that seems unlikely because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when the entire expression is expanded, considering all possible combinations of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that's still a polynomial, not a number. So, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me try to rephrase it: The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, in the expanded form, this product will have terms like \\(a^k b^{4 - k} c^m\\) or \\(a^k b^{4 - k} c^{-m}\\), etc., depending on the expansion of the second part. But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). But wait, the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times 64, which is 384. But let me check if that makes sense. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, considering all possible terms with any power of \\(c\\), so the coefficient would be 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that's a polynomial, not a number. So, perhaps the problem is only interested in the coefficient when considering the entire expression as a product, and the \\(c\\) terms are separate. Wait, but in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion, which doesn't make sense. Alternatively, maybe the problem is miswritten, and it's supposed to be \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), and we're to consider the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), that is, the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. That would make sense because then the coefficient would be a number. So, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), which is 1. So, in that case, we need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product. So, to find that, we can consider that the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\), which we know has a coefficient of 6, and then we need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, let's calculate that. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\). So, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Now, since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is the product of \\(a^2b^2\\) and \\(c^0\\), the overall coefficient would be the product of the coefficients from each part, which is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). So, the coefficient is 120. Let me double-check this reasoning. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\) with coefficient 6. The term \\(c^0\\) comes from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) with coefficient 20. When you multiply these together, you get \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\) as the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). That seems correct. So, I think the answer is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by considering the contributions from each part of the product.\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\):**  \n   Using the binomial theorem, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) has a coefficient of \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n\n2. **Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**  \n   We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0.

    "text": " Wait, no, that might not be correct because the \\(c\\) terms could affect the overall coefficient. Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think again. The expression is a product of two binomial expansions: \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when we multiply them, each term from the first expansion is multiplied by each term from the second expansion. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), we can consider that term as a constant with respect to \\(c\\). Wait, no, actually, that's not correct because \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\). So, the product will have terms that are products of powers of \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\). But the problem is specifically asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, that means we're looking for all the terms in the expansion where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2 each, and the exponents of \\(c\\) can be anything because they don't affect the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. Wait, no, actually, that's not quite right. The \\(a^2b^2\\) term would come from the product of the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in \\((a + b)^4\\) and any term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients in the second part. Wait, is that correct? Because when you multiply two expressions, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each expression. So, if I have \\( (a^2b^2 \\text{ term}) \\times (\\text{any term from the second expansion}) \\), but since the second expansion only involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), which don't interact with \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the product will be the same as the coefficient in the first part times the entire second expansion. But that doesn't make sense because then the coefficient would be a sum of terms. Wait, no, actually, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the product would be \\(6 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that's not correct because when you multiply two polynomials, each term from the first is multiplied by each term from the second. So, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the product would come from the product of the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first part and each term in the second part. But since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), that would mean that the \\(c\\) terms have to cancel out. Wait, but \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) can't cancel each other unless their exponents add up to zero. So, in the second expansion, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the only term that would contribute to a constant term (i.e., \\(c^0\\)) is the middle term where the exponents of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) balance out. So, maybe I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) and then multiply it by the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part. That sounds more accurate. So, let me break it down: The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is equal to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because when you multiply the two expressions, the only way to get a term with \\(a^2b^2\\) and no \\(c\\) is to multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term by the constant term in the second expansion. So, first, I found that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. Now, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem. The expansion is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k\\). Simplifying each term, that's \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} c^{-k} = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, each term has an exponent of \\(6 - 2k\\). We want the term where the exponent is 0, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20. Now, going back to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the product of the two coefficients we found: 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the second part). So, 6 * 20 = 120.

    "text": " Wait, no, that doesn't make sense because the \\(c\\) terms will affect the overall expression. But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), maybe the \\(c\\) part doesn't matter because \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term that doesn't include \\(c\\). Wait, but when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the expansion will be a product of a term from \\((a + b)^4\\) and a term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), that would imply that the coefficient from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) must be 1, right? Because if we have \\(a^2b^2\\) times some power of \\(c\\), the only way it contributes to the \\(a^2b^2\\) term without any \\(c\\) is if the power of \\(c\\) is zero, i.e., \\(c^0 = 1\\). So, perhaps I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because when I multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by \\(c^0\\), I just get \\(a^2b^2\\), and that's the term we're interested in. So, the overall coefficient would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me confirm that. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, as I found earlier. Now, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me think about how to expand that. Again, using the binomial theorem, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying that, each term becomes \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m} = \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the exponent of \\(c\\) in each term is \\(6 - 2m\\). We want the exponent to be 0, so we set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Now, going back to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) would be the product of the coefficients from each part. That is, 6 (from \\(a^2b^2\\)) multiplied by 20 (from \\(c^0\\)), which gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Wait, so is the final coefficient 120? Let me double-check that. So, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6. In \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. So, when we multiply these two parts together, each term in the expansion will be a product of a term from the first expansion and a term from the second. The \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part will be multiplied by every term from the second part, but only the term with \\(c^0\\) will result in a term that's just \\(a^2b^2\\). The other terms would have \\(c\\) raised to some power, so they wouldn't contribute to the \\(a^2b^2\\) term without any \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient is indeed \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Hmm, that seems right. Wait, but let me think again. When you multiply two polynomials, the coefficients multiply when the exponents add up to the desired term. But in this case, since we're looking for \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), the only way that can happen is if the \\(c\\) part is \\(c^0\\). So, the coefficient is the product of the coefficients from each part. So, 6 times 20 is 120. I think that's correct.

But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), that means we just need the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) for \\(a^2b^2\\) and then multiply it by the sum of all the coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because when you multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), each term in the \\(c\\) expansion will contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the overall product. Alternatively, maybe it's better to think that since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is independent of \\(c\\), we can compute the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) and then multiply it by the sum of the coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) will have a coefficient, and when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), they will all contribute to the overall coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. So, first, let me compute the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\), which I found to be 6. Now, I need to compute the sum of the coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, the sum of the coefficients in a polynomial is found by setting all variables to 1. So, if I substitute \\(c = 1\\) into \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), I get \\((1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of the coefficients is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). Wait, but let me check if that's correct. Alternatively, maybe I should think differently. Since the entire expression is the product of two independent expressions, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient from the first part times the sum of the coefficients from the second part. Because when you multiply, each term in the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 (from \\(a^2b^2\\)) multiplied by the sum of the coefficients from the second expression, which is 64. So, 6 * 64 = 384. That seems right. Alternatively, maybe I can think about it as each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) being multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But since we're only interested in \\(a^2b^2\\), which comes from one specific term in the first expansion, and then all the terms in the second expansion contribute their coefficients when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). So, yes, 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. Let me think again. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). When I expand this, each term from the first expansion is multiplied by each term from the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the term in the first expansion, which is \\(6a^2b^2\\), and then it's multiplied by every term in the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be \\(6 \\times\\) (sum of coefficients in the second expansion). Since the sum of coefficients in the second expansion is 64, then yes, 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me check if that's correct. Alternatively, perhaps the second expression's terms might affect the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), but no, because the second expression is only in terms of \\(c\\), so when you multiply, the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) remain as they are in the first expression. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the first part, and then it's multiplied by every term in the second part, so the coefficient is indeed 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Suppose I have two expressions, one in \\(a, b\\) and the other in \\(c\\). When I multiply them, the terms in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are independent of \\(c\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be present in the product only from the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first expression, and then multiplied by the entire second expression. But since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is independent of \\(c\\), it's just \\(6 \\times\\) the sum of coefficients in the second expression, which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can consider that when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each polynomial. But in this case, since \\(a^2b^2\\) is only from the first polynomial, and the second polynomial contributes all its terms, which are in \\(c\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient from the first polynomial times the sum of the coefficients from the second polynomial.\n\nWait, but to make sure, let me think about a simpler case. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, expanding, we get \\((a^2 + 2ab + b^2) \\times (c + 1/c)\\). The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in this product would be zero because \\(a^2b^2\\) isn't present. Wait, no, actually, in this case, \\(a^2b^2\\) isn't present because the second polynomial is only degree 1 in \\(c\\), so when you multiply, you can't get \\(a^2b^2\\) unless you have higher powers. Hmm, maybe this example isn't the best. Alternatively, perhaps I should think that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is just the coefficient from the first part times the sum of the coefficients from the second part because the second part doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. So, in this problem, the coefficient would be 6 * 64 = 384. So, I think that's the answer.\n\nWait, but let me check another way. Maybe I can expand both expressions and see. So, \\((a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. Now, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) can be expanded using the binomial theorem as \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\times (1/c)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, the expansion is \\(c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15(1/c^2) + 6(1/c^4) + 1/c^6\\). So, the sum of the coefficients is when \\(c = 1\\), which is \\(1 + 6 + 15 + 20 + 15 + 6 + 1 = 64\\), which matches what I thought earlier.\n\nNow, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, each term in the second expansion has a coefficient, and when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), they contribute to the overall coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. So, the total coefficient would be \\(6 \\times\\) (sum of coefficients in the second expansion) = \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\nWait, but let me think if this is correct. Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, each of those terms has a coefficient, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient from the first part times the sum of the coefficients from the second part, because each term in the second part is being multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), so all their coefficients add up to the total coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\). So, yes, 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of it as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) being the product of the coefficients from each part. Since the first part contributes 6, and the second part contributes 64 (the sum of its coefficients), then the total coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but another way to think about it is that the entire expression is a product of two polynomials, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the sum over all possible ways to get \\(a^2b^2\\) when multiplying terms from each polynomial. But since the second polynomial doesn't have \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) is to take \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first polynomial and any term from the second polynomial. So, the coefficient is 6 times the sum of the coefficients of the second polynomial, which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not overcomplicating this. Since the second polynomial is in terms of \\(c\\), and \\(a^2b^2\\) is in terms of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), when you multiply, the \\(c\\) terms just tag along. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is just the coefficient from the first part times the entire second polynomial. But since we're only interested in the coefficient, not the actual term, it's 6 times the sum of the coefficients of the second polynomial, which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me check again by considering specific terms. Suppose I take \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion and multiply it by each term in the second expansion. Each term in the second expansion has a coefficient, and when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), they contribute to the overall coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. So, the total coefficient would be the sum of all these products, which is 6 times each coefficient in the second expansion. But since we're adding all these up, it's equivalent to 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64. So, 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nI think that makes sense.

So, perhaps the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 multiplied by the sum of the coefficients of all terms in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but no, that's not quite right. Because when you multiply two expressions, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression. So, if I'm only interested in the term \\(a^2b^2\\), then I have to take the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part, which is 6a\u00b2b\u00b2, and then multiply it by the entire second part, which is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).

The problem is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, if I expand both parts separately, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), we can consider that \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\) and is multiplied by the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because if we multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by any term involving \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), it would become \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or something, which isn't just \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the only way to get a term with \\(a^2b^2\\) is to multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part by the constant term (i.e., the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero) from the second part. So, first, let's find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which we already found to be 6. Next, we need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me expand that using the binomial theorem. So, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m} = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is when \\(m = 3\\), and its coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the second part), which is 6 * 20 = 120. Wait, that seems straightforward, but let me double-check. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the product of the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in \\((a + b)^4\\) and the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Since the constant term is 20, the total coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120.

    "text": " Wait, no, that's not correct. Actually, the entire expression is the product of two expansions: one in terms of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the other in terms of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). But since we're only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), that term will come from the product of the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first part and any term from the second part, because when you multiply, any term from the second expansion will be multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). But wait, no, that's not quite right. Wait, actually, no. Because the entire expression is the product of two separate binomial expansions, each term in the product will be a combination of a term from \\((a + b)^4\\) and a term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because when you multiply, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will be multiplied by every term in the second expansion. But wait, that doesn't make sense because that would mean the coefficient is a sum over all the terms in the second expansion. Wait, no, that's not correct because when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. So, if we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), we need to consider that \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term from the first expansion, and then it's multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, which would mean that the \\(a^2b^2\\) term is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, so the coefficient would be the sum of all the coefficients in the second expansion multiplied by the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion. Wait, that seems confusing. Let me think again. Maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, which is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), and \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient would just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't make sense because that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), but the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. Wait, no, the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\). So, perhaps the coefficient is the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the coefficient from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) evaluated at \\(c^0\\), because we don't want any \\(c\\) terms. Wait, that might be it. Because when you multiply, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the sum of all the coefficients in the second part. But that can't be right because the second part has terms with \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), so their coefficients are separate. Wait, no, perhaps I'm making a mistake here. Let me think again. The product \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) can be seen as a product of two polynomials. When you multiply them, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial will be multiplied by every term in the second polynomial, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) where \\(k\\) ranges from -6 to 6 in steps of 2, I think. But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2 each, but any exponent of \\(c\\), right? Wait, no, the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, actually, in the entire product, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a sum involving \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Maybe it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, treating \\(c\\) as a variable, but that would mean the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\). Alternatively, maybe the problem is considering \\(c\\) as a separate variable and wants the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, meaning that the coefficient would be the same as the coefficient in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't make sense because the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) would be when \\(c = 1\\), which is \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, maybe the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times 64, which is 384. But I'm not sure if that's correct. Wait, no, that approach might not be right. Let me think again. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, so the coefficient would be the product of the coefficients from each part. But since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient would just be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would make the coefficient a sum involving \\(c\\), which isn't a numerical coefficient. So, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, meaning that the coefficient would be the same as in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that's not quite right because the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is obtained by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\(2^6 = 64\\). So, if I take the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and multiply it by 64, I get 384. But I'm not sure if that's correct because I'm not sure if that's what the problem is asking. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and the rest of the expression is a red herring. But that doesn't make sense because the problem includes the entire product, so the answer should account for the other part. Wait, maybe I'm making a mistake here. Let me try a different approach. Let's consider the entire expression: \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When expanding this, each term will be of the form \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}a^{4 - k}b^k \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - m}\\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying the \\(c\\) terms, that's \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the general term is \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}\\dbinom{6}{m}a^{4 - k}b^k c^{6 - 2m}\\). Now, we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, we set \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). So, \\(k = 2\\), and the coefficient from the first part is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Now, for the \\(c\\) terms, since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), we can consider the coefficient as the sum over all \\(m\\) such that \\(6 - 2m\\) is any exponent, but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is independent of \\(c\\), we need to consider the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion. Wait, that is, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But the sum of all coefficients in a polynomial is obtained by setting all variables to 1. So, setting \\(c = 1\\), we get \\(\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient would be 6 * 64 = 384. But wait, that seems high. Alternatively, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, which would involve considering all possible terms, but since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient would just be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion, which is a polynomial in \\(c\\), but the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, so that can't be right. Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think differently. Maybe the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, the coefficient would be the same as the coefficient in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384, as I thought earlier. Alternatively, maybe the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and the rest is irrelevant. But that seems unlikely because the problem includes the entire product. Wait, let me check the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product. Since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient would be the same as the coefficient in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because when you multiply, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Therefore, the sum of all coefficients in the second part is obtained by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\(2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, maybe I'm wrong, and the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where \\(c\\) is to the zero power. That would make more sense because then the coefficient would be a numerical value. So, if that's the case, then we need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product. To do that, we can consider the product as \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) would be the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, first, as before, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. Now, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is the middle term, which occurs when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. To find this, we can use the binomial theorem on \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me write that out: \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be zero, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which implies \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). But wait, the problem didn't specify \\(c^0\\), it just said \\(a^2b^2\\). So, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which would mean the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that would make the coefficient a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. Therefore, I think the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and the rest is irrelevant. But that seems unlikely because the problem includes the entire product. Wait, maybe I should check what happens when you expand the entire product. Let me think: the product is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Each term in the expansion will be of the form \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}a^{4 - k}b^k \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - m}\\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\), which simplifies to \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}\\dbinom{6}{m}a^{4 - k}b^k c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would occur when \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\), as before. So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the sum over all \\(m\\) of \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\dbinom{6}{m}\\), because \\(c^{6 - 2m}\\) can be any power, but since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is independent of \\(c\\), the coefficient would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\sum_{m=0}^{6}\\dbinom{6}{m}\\). But the sum of \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\) from \\(m=0\\) to \\(6\\) is \\(2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient would be \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). But that seems high, and I'm not sure if that's what the problem is asking. Alternatively, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then the coefficient is 6 times 20, which is 120. I think that's more likely what the problem is asking because otherwise, the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense in this context. So, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. Alternatively, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, which would mean the coefficient is a sum over all \\(c\\) terms. But that seems unlikely because the problem is probably expecting a numerical answer. So, I think the correct approach is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 6 times 20, which equals 120. Therefore, the coefficient is 120.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. If I consider the entire product, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 6 times 64, which is 384. But that would mean the coefficient is 384, which is different from 120. So, which is it?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that would make the coefficient a polynomial in \\(c\\), which isn't a numerical value. Therefore, the problem must be asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nBut I'm still confused because the problem didn't specify \\(c^0\\). It just said \\(a^2b^2\\). So, perhaps the problem is considering \\(c\\) as a separate variable, and the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the same as in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which would make the coefficient a polynomial in \\(c\\). But that seems unlikely because the problem is probably expecting a numerical answer. Therefore, I think the intended interpretation is that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nWait, but let me think again. If I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product when \\(c = 1\\) would be 6 * 64 = 384. But that's only when \\(c = 1\\). However, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, not when \\(c = 1\\). So, perhaps the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 6 times \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\), so the coefficient would be 6 times each term in the expansion, which would make the coefficient a polynomial in \\(c\\). But since the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, perhaps it's expecting the coefficient when considering \\(c\\) as another variable, but that doesn't make sense because coefficients are numerical. Therefore, I think the problem must be asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nWait, but let me check the original problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" It doesn't specify \\(c^0\\), so perhaps the intended answer is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, maybe the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and the rest is irrelevant. But that seems unlikely because the problem includes the entire product.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is miswritten, and it's supposed to say \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), but as it stands, it's just \\(a^2b^2\\). So, perhaps the answer is 384. But I'm not sure. Let me try to see which approach makes more sense.\n\nIf I consider the product \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), then each term in the product will be of the form \\(a^{4 - k}b^k c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be present in the product for all values of \\(m\\) from 0 to 6, each multiplied by the corresponding \\(c^{6 - 2m}\\) term. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the sum over all \\(m\\) of \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\dbinom{6}{m}\\). Since \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\), the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\) from \\(m = 0\\) to \\(6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 384.\n\nWait, but that seems correct because each term in the product is a combination of a term from the first expansion and a term from the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the same as the coefficient in the first expansion times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. Therefore, the answer is 384.\n\nBut I'm still confused because the problem didn't specify \\(c^0\\). So, perhaps the intended answer is 384. Alternatively, maybe the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and the rest is a distraction. But that seems unlikely because the problem includes the entire product.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable, which would mean that the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), but the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, so that can't be right. Therefore, I think the correct interpretation is that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), which would be 384.\n\nI think I need to resolve this confusion. Let me look for similar problems. Typically, when a problem asks for the coefficient of a term in a product of two polynomials, it's considering the term as a combination of variables. So, if the term doesn't involve another variable, like \\(c\\), then the coefficient would be the coefficient from the first polynomial times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial. So, in this case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it's 6 * 20 = 120. But since the problem didn't specify \\(c^0\\), I think the intended answer is 384.\n\nWait, but let me think about it differently. Suppose I have two polynomials, P(a, b) and Q(c). The product P(a, b) * Q(c) will have terms that are products of terms from P and terms from Q. So, the coefficient of a term like \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in P(a, b) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in Q(c). Because when you multiply, each term in P is multiplied by each term in Q, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the same as in P times the sum of coefficients in Q.\n\nIn this case, P(a, b) is \\((a + b)^4\\), and Q(c) is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The sum of coefficients in Q(c) is obtained by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\(2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nTherefore, I think the correct answer is 384.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was 120, considering \\(c^0\\). But now, considering that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), it's 384. So, I think that's the right approach.\n\nSo, to summarize:\n\n1. Find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n\n2. Find the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is obtained by setting \\(c = 1\\), giving \\(2^6 = 64\\).\n\n3. Multiply these two results: \\(6 * 64 = 384\\).\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 384.\n\nBut wait, I'm still unsure because I initially thought it was 120. Let me check with specific values. Suppose \\(a = 1\\), \\(b = 1\\), \\(c = 1\\). Then, \\((a + b)^4 = 16\\), and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = 64\\). So, the product is 16 * 64 = 1024. Now, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 * 64 = 384, so when \\(a = 1\\) and \\(b = 1\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would contribute 384 * 1 * 1 = 384 to the total. But the total product is 1024, so 384 is less than 1024, which makes sense because there are other terms as well.\n\nAlternatively, if I set \\(c = 1\\), the product becomes \\((a + b)^4 * 64\\). The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, so in the product, it's 6 * 64 = 384, which matches.\n\nTherefore, I think the correct answer is 384.\n\nBut wait, earlier I thought about \\(c^0\\) and got 120. Let me see why that approach was wrong. If I'm looking for \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then I need the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion. The coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is 6 * 20 = 120. But the problem didn't specify \\(c^0\\), so that's a different term.\n\nTherefore, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, the answer is 384.\n\nWait, but I think I'm making a mistake here. When you have a term like \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, it's actually the product of \\(a^2b^2\\) and any term from the second expansion, so the coefficient would be the sum over all terms in the second expansion multiplied by the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion. Therefore, the coefficient is indeed 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nTherefore, I think the correct answer is 384.\n\nBut I'm still confused because I initially thought it was 120. Let me try to see if that's the case. If I set \\(c = 1\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 384, but if I set \\(c\\) such that only the \\(c^0\\) term is considered, then it's 120. Since the problem didn't specify, I think the intended answer is 384.\n\nWait, but let me think about it differently. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. That means, in the entire expansion, how many times does \\(a^2b^2\\) appear, considering all possible \\(c\\) terms. So, each time \\(a^2b^2\\) appears, it's multiplied by some power of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the sum over all possible \\(c\\) exponents, which is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 384.\n\nBut I'm still not entirely confident because I've seen similar problems where the answer is 120, considering \\(c^0\\). Maybe the problem is expecting that. Let me try to see.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, considering only the terms where \\(c\\) is also squared or something. But that's not specified.\n\nWait, perhaps I should look at the problem again. It says: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. Therefore, the coefficient is the same as in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nTherefore, I think the correct answer is 384.\n\nBut to make sure, let me consider a simpler case. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^1 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, the expansion is \\((a + b)(c + 1/c)\\). The coefficient of \\(a^1b^0\\) would be the coefficient of \\(a\\) in the first part, which is 1, times the sum of coefficients in the second part, which is \\(1 + 1 = 2\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a\\) in the product would be 1 * 2 = 2. Similarly, the coefficient of \\(a^0b^1\\) would be 1 * 2 = 2. If I set \\(c = 1\\), then the product is \\((a + b)(2) = 2a + 2b\\), which matches the coefficients.\n\nAlternatively, if I look for the coefficient of \\(a^1b^0c^0\\), it would be 1 * 1 = 1, because the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\((c + 1/c)^1\\) is 1.\n\nTherefore, in the original problem, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), it's 6 * 64 = 384, and if I'm looking for \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), it's 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nSince the problem didn't specify \\(c^0\\), I think the intended answer is 384.\n\nWait, but I'm still unsure. Let me check with another example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^2\\). The expansion is \\((a^2 + 2ab + b^2)(c^2 + 2 + 1/c^2)\\). The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^2\\), which is 1, times the sum of coefficients in \\((c + 1/c)^2\\), which is \\(1 + 2 + 1 = 4\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 1 * 4 = 4. Alternatively, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) would be 1 * 2 = 2.\n\nIf I set \\(c = 1\\), then the product is \\((a + b)^2 * 4 = 4a^2 + 8ab + 4b^2\\). The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) isn't present here, but if I consider the product without setting \\(c = 1\\), then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 4, as calculated earlier.\n\nTherefore, in this simpler case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 4, which is the coefficient from the first expansion times the sum of coefficients from the second expansion.\n\nTherefore, applying the same logic to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nSo, I think that's the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{384}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem for both parts of the expression.\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\), so the coefficient is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2"

    "text": " Wait, no, that doesn't make sense because the entire expression is multiplied together. Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think again. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so that term would come from the product of the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in \\((a + b)^4\\) and the constant term (if any) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, because when you multiply two terms, each term is a product of a term from the first expansion and a term from the second expansion. So, if I take \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part, I need to multiply it by whatever term from the second expansion that doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), because \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't have any \\(c\\) terms. So, I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). That is, the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. So, let me apply the binomial theorem to \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The expansion is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying each term, that becomes \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m - m} = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). Now, I need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, so I set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\) so \\(m = 3\\). So, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20. Now, going back to the original expression, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from multiplying \\(6a^2b^2\\) (from the first part) by \\(20\\) (from the second part). So, the coefficient would be \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Wait, but let me make sure I didn't miss anything. So, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). When expanding, each term is a product of a term from the first expansion and a term from the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from taking \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part and the constant term from the second part. Since there are no other terms in the second expansion that would contribute to \\(a^2b^2\\) without involving \\(c\\), that should be the only contribution. So, yes, the coefficient is 6 times 20, which is 120. I think that's the answer. Let me just double-check my calculations. \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\), correct. \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\), correct. 6 times 20 is indeed 120.

    "text": " Wait, no, that might not be correct. Let me think again. Actually, when we multiply two expressions together, each term in the first expression is multiplied by each term in the second expression. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by every term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, I think that the coefficient will be the same as the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but I'm not sure. Wait, no, that doesn't make sense because the \\(c\\) terms would affect the overall coefficient. Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try to break it down more carefully. So, the original expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When you expand this, each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is \\(6a^2b^2\\). Now, when I multiply this by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), I get \\(6a^2b^2 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be \\(6\\) times the sum of all the terms in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that can't be right because each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) has a coefficient, and when multiplied by \\(6\\), would contribute to the overall coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. Wait, but the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, maybe the coefficient is just \\(6\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that seems too broad. Alternatively, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question. Wait, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating \\(c\\) as another variable. But then, that would mean that each term in the product would have terms involving \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\). So, maybe the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the sum of all coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) multiplied by 6, because the \\(a^2b^2\\) term is 6 times \\(a^2b^2\\) and then multiplied by each term in the other expansion. Wait, but that would mean the coefficient is 6 times the sum of the coefficients of all terms in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that's not possible because each term in the product would have a specific combination of \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\). Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me try a different approach. The problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, in other words, when we multiply the two expressions, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will be multiplied by every possible term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be 6 (from \\((a + b)^4\\)) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, that can't be right because each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) has a different power of \\(c\\), so when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each of those, each product will have a different power of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that seems incorrect because the coefficient should be a numerical value, not an expression involving \\(c\\). Wait, perhaps I'm making a mistake here. Let me clarify: when we talk about the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, we're considering all terms where \\(a\\) is squared and \\(b\\) is squared, regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, each such term would be \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by some power of \\(c\\), and the coefficient would be the sum of all coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) multiplied by 6. But that would mean the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). However, the sum of all coefficients in a polynomial is found by setting all variables to 1. So, if I set \\(c = 1\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), I get \\((1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 64. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times 64, which is 384. Wait, that seems plausible, but let me check again. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me think: when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term (like \\(a^2b^2\\)) is the product of the coefficients from each polynomial for the respective terms. But in this case, the second polynomial is in terms of \\(c\\), so when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second polynomial, each of those terms has a coefficient, and each will contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. So, the total coefficient would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial. Because each term in the second polynomial is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial. Since the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 64, as I found earlier, then the coefficient would be 6 * 64 = 384. Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that each term in the second polynomial contributes to the coefficient when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). So, each term in the second polynomial has a coefficient, say, \\(k\\), and when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), it becomes \\(k a^2b^2 c^n\\) for some \\(n\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the sum of all coefficients from the second polynomial multiplied by 6. So, yes, that would be 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, maybe I'm missing something because the second polynomial is not a polynomial in the same variables as the first. Wait, but the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, in other words, we're treating \\(c\\) as another variable, but we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), irrespective of the \\(c\\) exponents. So, in that case, the coefficient would be the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all coefficients from the second part. So, that would indeed be 6 * 64 = 384. Let me check that again. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\(2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, perhaps I should approach this differently by considering the entire expansion. Let me try expanding both parts separately. First, \\((a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6. Now, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) can be expanded using the binomial theorem as \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, each term in this expansion is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). Now, when we multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be \\(6\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). As we calculated earlier, the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). So, I think that's the correct answer. But let me double-check my reasoning. Another way to think about it is that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the product of the coefficients of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Since the sum of coefficients in the second expression is 64, the total coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that each term in the product is of the form \\(a^2b^2 \\times c^m\\) where \\(m\\) can be any integer, positive or negative. But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), the coefficient would indeed be the sum of all coefficients from the second polynomial multiplied by 6. Therefore, I'm confident that the coefficient is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplying it by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 64. Thus, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{384}"

But since we're only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), that would mean that the \\(c\\) part must multiply in such a way that the \\(c\\) terms cancel out, leaving a constant term. Wait, because if I have a term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) that's a constant (i.e., \\(c^0\\)), then when I multiply it by \\(a^2b^2\\), it will just contribute a scalar multiple to \\(a^2b^2\\). On the other hand, if the term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) has a positive or negative exponent of \\(c\\), then when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), it would result in a term that includes \\(c\\), which we don't want.

So, I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me work on that. Again, using the binomial theorem, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero because that's the constant term. So, set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which gives \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} c^{0} = \\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20.

From \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the constant term is when \\(m = 3\\), so \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\), which is correct. Multiplying them together gives 6 * 20 = 120. Hmm, that seems right.

When you multiply two expressions together, each term in the first expression is multiplied by each term in the second. So, for the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, it will be multiplied by every term in the second part. But we're only interested in the terms where the product doesn't have any \\(c\\) terms, so the \\(c\\) part must be \\(c^0\\), which is the constant term. So, yes, that means we have to take the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and multiply it by the constant term in the second part, which is 20, giving 120.

Wait, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning that we're looking for the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\), which is 1. So, in that case, I would need to consider both expansions and find the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2 and 2, respectively, and the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0. So, let's break it down. First, from \\((a + b)^4\\), as I found earlier, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. Now, from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\), which is the constant term. Because when we multiply the two expansions, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term from the second part. But since we're only interested in the term where the power of \\(c\\) is 0, we need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, let me find that. Again, using the binomial theorem, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We want the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so we set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Now, going back to the original expression, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Therefore, when we multiply these two parts together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, but only the constant term will contribute to \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 times 20, which is 120. Wait, but let me double-check. So, \\((a + b)^4\\) gives 6 for \\(a^2b^2\\), and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) gives 20 for \\(c^0\\). So, when you multiply these together, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2 \\times c^0\\) is 6 * 20 = 120. Yeah, that makes sense. So, the final answer should be 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplying it by the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20. Thus, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\boxed{120}"

    "text": " Wait, no, that doesn't make sense because the \\(c\\) terms are separate. Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are independent of those involving \\(c\\). So, when I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I can treat the \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) part as a constant because it doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. Wait, is that correct? Hmm. Let me think. If I have \\((a + b)^4\\) times some expression in \\(c\\), then when I expand it, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a specific term in the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) part, the \\(c\\) terms will just be coefficients in front of that \\(a^2b^2\\) term. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But wait, that seems like it would result in a sum, not a single coefficient. Hmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, in that case, the \\(c\\) part doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) part, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be 6, as I found earlier, multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. Wait, perhaps I misread the problem. Let me check again. It says: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\).\" So, maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times some power of \\(c\\), but it's just written as \\(a^2b^2\\), so perhaps it's considering the entire expression, and the \\(c\\) terms are part of the coefficient. So, in that case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that seems too broad because the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) has multiple terms. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, so it's just 6 times the entire \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would make the coefficient a polynomial, not a single number. Hmm, that doesn't seem right. Maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Wait, perhaps the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, without considering the \\(c\\) terms. So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the entire \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but that would still be a polynomial. Alternatively, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating the \\(c\\) terms as separate variables, so the coefficient would be 6 times the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that seems a bit odd because the coefficient should be a number, not an expression. Wait, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when considering all terms, regardless of \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is a sum of terms involving different powers of \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a single coefficient. Hmm, maybe I'm missing something here. Let me try to approach this differently. Perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion of the entire expression, which includes the \\(c\\) terms. So, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all terms in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but that can't be right because that sum would be a number. Wait, no, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is a polynomial in \\(c\\), so when you multiply it by 6, you get a polynomial where each term is 6 times the corresponding term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would be 6 times each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\). That seems inconsistent with the problem statement, which is probably expecting a numerical coefficient. So, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, but treating \\(c\\) as a variable independent of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), so the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't seem right either. Alternatively, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, considering that the entire expression is a product, so the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Wait, but the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) would be found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, if I do that, then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times 64, which is 384. But I'm not sure if that's correct. Let me think again. If I have \\((a + b)^4\\) times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), then each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when considering the entire expression as a product, and the answer is just 6, since the \\(c\\) terms are separate. But that seems too simple. Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me try to think differently. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, in other words, when you expand the entire expression, what is the coefficient of the term that has \\(a^2b^2\\). Since the \\(c\\) terms are separate, the coefficient would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), so perhaps the problem is expecting the coefficient as an expression in terms of \\(c\\). But the problem didn't specify, so maybe I should just compute the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) and then note that it's multiplied by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Wait, but the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so maybe it's just 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that seems odd because usually, a coefficient is a number, not an expression. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting the coefficient when all variables are considered, so maybe it's 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). As I thought earlier, the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is found by substituting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\(2^6 = 64\\). So, 6 times 64 is 384. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 384. But I'm not entirely sure if that's the correct approach. Let me check again. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, so it's 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which would be \\(6 \\times (c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15/c^2 + 6/c^4 + 1/c^6)\\). But that would make the coefficient a polynomial, which doesn't seem right. Alternatively, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), treating the \\(c\\) terms as constants, so it's 6 times the entire \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But I think that's not the case. Let me try to look for similar problems or think about how coefficients work in products. When you have two polynomials multiplied together, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the product of the coefficients from each polynomial for the respective terms that multiply to give that term. But in this case, the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from those involving \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), where each term is 6 times the corresponding term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and not a specific term involving \\(c\\), maybe it's expecting just the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then the rest is part of the coefficient involving \\(c\\). But that seems a bit unclear. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is miswritten, and it's supposed to ask for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some \\(k\\), but as it stands, it's just asking for \\(a^2b^2\\). Maybe the problem is assuming that \\(c\\) is a constant, so the coefficient would be 6 times the value of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would depend on the value of \\(c\\), which isn't given. Hmm, this is confusing. Let me try to approach it differently. Maybe I should expand both parts separately and then see how they multiply. So, first, \\((a + b)^4\\) expanded is \\(a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. Now, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) can be expanded using the binomial theorem as \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(1/c\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, that would give terms like \\(c^6, 6c^4, 15c^2, 20, 15/c^2, 6/c^4, 1/c^6\\). Now, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from \\((a + b)^4\\) would be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), resulting in terms like \\(6a^2b^2c^6, 6a^2b^2c^4, 90a^2b^2c^2, 120a^2b^2, 90a^2b^2/c^2, 36a^2b^2/c^4, 6a^2b^2/c^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is actually a polynomial in \\(c\\): \\(6c^6 + 6c^4 + 90c^2 + 120 + 90/c^2 + 36/c^4 + 6/c^6\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which in this context would be this entire polynomial. However, usually, when someone asks for the coefficient of a term in an expression, they're referring to the numerical coefficient, assuming all variables are treated as constants. But in this case, since \\(c\\) is a variable, the coefficient is a polynomial. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting the coefficient when considering all possible \\(c\\) terms, so it's just 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is what I have here. But that seems a bit odd because coefficients are typically numbers, not expressions. Maybe the problem is expecting the sum of all coefficients, which would be found by setting \\(c = 1\\). So, if I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = (1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). Then, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times 64, which is 384. But I'm not entirely sure if that's the correct interpretation. Alternatively, maybe the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without considering \\(c\\), so it's just 6. But that seems too straightforward, and the presence of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) in the problem makes me think that it's supposed to be part of the coefficient. So, perhaps the correct answer is that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(6 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which expands to the polynomial I wrote earlier. But since the problem is asking for the coefficient, maybe it's just 6, and the rest is part of the term involving \\(c\\). Wait, no, that doesn't make sense because the coefficient includes the factors from both parts of the product. Let me try to think of it this way: when you have two expressions multiplied together, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each expression that multiply to give that term. But in this case, since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, that would be \\(6 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which can be expanded as \\(6c^6 + 36c^4 + 90c^2 + 120 + 90/c^2 + 36/c^4 + 6/c^6\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient, so maybe it's just 6 times the expansion, which is what I have here. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting a numerical value, so maybe I'm supposed to sum all the coefficients, which would be 6 times 64, which is 384. But I'm not entirely sure. Let me check the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\).\" It doesn't specify anything about \\(c\\), so maybe it's expecting the coefficient as an expression involving \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient would be \\(6 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is the polynomial I wrote earlier. But since the problem is presented in a mathematical context, perhaps it's expecting the answer in a specific form. Alternatively, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, so it's just 6. But that seems too simple, especially since the other part of the expression is given. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting the coefficient when considering \\(c\\) as a variable, so the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(6 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is \\(6c^6 + 36c^4 + 90c^2 + 120 + 90/c^2 + 36/c^4 + 6/c^6\\). But the problem might be expecting it in a factored form, so \\(6 \\left(c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15/c^2 + 6/c^4 + 1/c^6\\right)\\), which is the same as \\(6 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting the coefficient to be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 times 64, which is 384. But I'm not entirely sure. Given that the problem is presented as a math problem to solve, and considering that the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is a standard binomial expansion, I think the correct approach is to recognize that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), resulting in a polynomial. Therefore, the coefficient is \\(6 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which can be expanded as I did earlier. However, since the problem is asking for the coefficient, and not the expanded form, perhaps the answer is simply \\(6 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Alternatively, if the problem is expecting a numerical coefficient, then perhaps it's 384, but I'm not sure. Wait, maybe I should check what the problem is asking again. It says: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\).\" So, in the product, each term is a product of terms from each factor. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\) and is multiplied by each term from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times each term from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(6 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But the problem might be expecting it in a specific form, perhaps expanded. Alternatively, maybe the problem is expecting the coefficient when all variables are considered, so the numerical coefficient when \\(c = 1\\), which would be 6 times 64, which is 384. But I'm not sure. Given that, I think the most accurate answer is that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(6 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which expands to \\(6c^6 + 36c^4 + 90c^2 + 120 + 90/c^2 + 36/c^4 + 6/c^6\\). However, since the problem is asking for the coefficient, and not the expanded form, perhaps it's acceptable to leave it as \\(6 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Alternatively, if the problem is expecting a numerical coefficient, then it's 384. But I think the correct approach is to recognize that the coefficient is a polynomial, so the answer is \\(6 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But let me check the problem again. It says: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\).\" Since the problem is in terms of multiple variables, the coefficient would indeed be a polynomial in \\(c\\), so the answer is \\(6 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which can be written as \\(6 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Alternatively, if the problem is expecting the coefficient when considering all terms, perhaps it's 6 times the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 times 64, which is 384. But I think that's not the correct interpretation because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not the sum of coefficients. Therefore, I think the correct answer is that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(6 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is \\(6c^6 + 36c^4 + 90c^2 + 120 + 90/c^2 + 36/c^4 + 6/c^6\\). But since the problem is asking for the coefficient, and not the expanded form, perhaps it's acceptable to present it as \\(6 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Alternatively, if the problem is expecting a numerical coefficient, then it's 384. But given the context, I think the answer is \\(6 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Wait, but let me think again. When you have a product of two expressions, the coefficient of a term in the product is the product of the coefficients of the terms that multiply to give that term. But in this case, since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, that would be \\(6 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(6 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is the answer. So, I think that's the correct approach. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(6 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Alternatively, if the problem is expecting the coefficient when \\(c = 1\\), then it's 6 times 64, which is 384. But since the problem doesn't specify, I think the correct answer is \\(6 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\).\n\nWait, but I just realized that in the original problem, it's written as \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the entire expression is a product, and when you expand it, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is the same as \\(6 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the answer is \\(6 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which can also be written as \\(6 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Alternatively, if the problem expects the expansion, it's \\(6c^6 + 36c^4 + 90c^2 + 120 + 90/c^2 + 36/c^4 + 6/c^6\\). But since the problem is asking for the coefficient, I think the answer is \\(6 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\).\n\nBut wait, another thought: perhaps the problem is expecting the coefficient to be a numerical value, treating \\(c\\) as a variable. In that case, the coefficient would be a polynomial, so maybe the problem is expecting the answer in terms of \\(c\\), so \\(6 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Alternatively, if the problem is expecting the coefficient when all variables are considered, it's 6 times the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 times 64, which is 384. But I think that's not the correct interpretation because the sum of coefficients is a different concept. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the product of the coefficients from each part, which is 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, I think the correct answer is \\(6 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\).\n\nBut now I'm getting confused because I'm not sure if the problem expects a polynomial or a numerical value. Let me try to think of it differently. If the problem had only \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. If the problem had \\((a + b)^4 \\times k\\), where \\(k\\) is a constant, the coefficient would be 6k. In this case, \\(k\\) is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial. So, the coefficient is 6 times that polynomial, which is \\(6 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the answer is \\(6 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\).\n\nAlternatively, if the problem is expecting the coefficient when \\(c = 1\\), then it's 6 times 64, which is 384. But since the problem doesn't specify, I think the correct answer is \\(6 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, I'll go with that.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{6 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6}.\n\nWait, but the system might be expecting a numerical answer. Let me check again.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me think again. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The coefficient of \\(c^0\\) (the constant term) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, when you multiply the two, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\) would be 6 * 20 = 120. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, perhaps the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial. Alternatively, if the problem is considering all possible powers of \\(c\\), then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting the coefficient when \\(c\\) is treated as a variable, so the coefficient is 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is the polynomial I mentioned earlier. But since the problem is presented in a mathematical context, perhaps the answer is 384. Wait, but I think the correct approach is to recognize that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial. Therefore, the answer is \\(6 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But if the problem expects a numerical coefficient, then it's 384. However, given the problem statement, I think the correct answer is \\(6 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\).\n\nBut wait, another approach: perhaps the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating \\(c\\) as a variable. So, the coefficient would be 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is \\(6 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the final answer is \\boxed{6 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6}.\n\nWait, but looking back, I think I made a mistake. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, and the other part is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), so the coefficient is 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the answer is \\boxed{6 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6}.\n\nBut now I'm confused because sometimes in problems like this, the coefficient is considered as a number, so perhaps the problem is expecting 384. Alternatively, maybe I should calculate the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when \\(c = 1\\), which would be 6 * 64 = 384. But I'm not sure. Given the problem statement, I think the answer is \\(6 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), so I'll go with that.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{6 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6}.\n\nWait, but I just realized that in the problem statement, it's written as \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), so the entire expression is a product. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, that would be \\(6 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is the answer. Therefore, the final answer is \\boxed{6 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6}.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem expects a numerical coefficient, then perhaps it's 384, but I think that's not the case. So, I'll stick with the polynomial.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{6 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem for both parts of the expression.\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\), so the coefficient is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\n   \\]\n\n2. **Consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n   \\]\n   This expansion results in terms involving various powers of \\(c\\).\n\n3. **Combine the results:**\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\n4. **Final coefficient:**\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is:\n   \\[\n   6 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\n   \\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is \\(\\boxed{6 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6}\\)."

So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that can't be right because when you multiply by each term, the \\(c\\) terms would affect the coefficient. Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try another approach. Since the \\(a^2b^2\\) term is only from \\((a + b)^4\\), and the other part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is multiplied by each term. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that's not correct because each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) has a coefficient and a power of \\(c\\). So, when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), you'll get terms like \\(6 a^2b^2 c^k\\) and \\(6 a^2b^2 c^{-k}\\) for various \\(k\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, actually, the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because each term's coefficient gets multiplied by 6. So, to find the total coefficient, I need to compute 6 times the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Now, how do I find the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)? Well, the sum of the coefficients in a polynomial is found by setting all variables to 1. So, if I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = (2)^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 times 64, which is 384. Wait, but let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. Because when I set \\(c = 1\\), I'm effectively summing all the coefficients, which is correct. So, yes, the sum is 64, and multiplying by 6 gives 384. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 384. Let me just double-check my reasoning. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), and its coefficient is 6. The second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), when expanded, has terms with various powers of \\(c\\), but each term's coefficient is multiplied by 6 when combined with \\(a^2b^2\\). So, to get the total coefficient, I sum all the coefficients from the second part, which is 64, and then multiply by 6, giving 384. Yeah, that makes sense.

But wait, that doesn't make sense because when you multiply two expressions, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression. So, actually, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems a bit off because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term without \\(c\\). Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think again. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when you expand this, each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by every term from the second part. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\). So, that would mean that in the product, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term is multiplied by the constant term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because any term involving \\(c\\) would make the term have \\(c\\) in it, so the only way to get a term that's just \\(a^2b^2\\) is if it's multiplied by the constant term (i.e., the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero) from the second expansion. So, I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), then multiply it by 6, and that would give me the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression. Okay, so let me find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Again, using the binomial theorem: \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying each term, that's \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m} = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, each term has an exponent of \\(6 - 2m\\). We want the term where the exponent is zero, because that's the constant term. So, set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which gives \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is when \\(m = 3\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} c^{0} = \\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20. Therefore, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (the constant term from the second part), which is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Wait, but let me double-check. Is there any other term that could contribute to \\(a^2b^2\\) without involving \\(c\\)? No, because the other terms in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) would have positive or negative exponents of \\(c\\), so when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), they would give terms like \\(a^2b^2c\\) or \\(a^2b^2/c\\), which are not \\(a^2b^2\\) alone. So, only the constant term from the second expansion contributes to the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. Therefore, the coefficient is indeed 120. So, putting it all together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is found by considering the binomial expansions of each part and identifying the relevant terms. \n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\):**\n   - The term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\), with coefficient \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n\n2. **Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   - The constant term (where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0) occurs when \\(m = 3\\), giving \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n\n3. **Multiply the coefficients:**\n   - The coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), maybe the other polynomial's terms just contribute a factor that we can include in the coefficient. Wait, let me think again. The problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product of \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when we multiply these two expressions, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).

Wait, no, that doesn't sound right. Let me try to approach it differently. Let me denote \\(P = (a + b)^4\\) and \\(Q = \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Then the product is \\(P \\times Q\\). The term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(P\\) is \\(6a^2b^2\\). When we multiply \\(P\\) by \\(Q\\), this term \\(6a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in \\(Q\\). So, each term in \\(Q\\) is of the form \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - k}\\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, when we multiply \\(6a^2b^2\\) by each term in \\(Q\\), we get terms like \\(6 \\times \\dbinom{6}{k}a^2b^2c^{6 - 2k}\\). Now, the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would be the sum of all coefficients from each term in \\(Q\\) multiplied by 6. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\(P \\times Q\\) is \\(6 \\times \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k}\\). Wait, but that can't be right because \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the coefficient would be \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). But that seems too high. Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Alternatively, perhaps I don't need to consider the \\(c\\) terms at all because the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, maybe the coefficient is just 6 times the entire expansion of \\(Q\\), which is \\(6 \\times (c + 1/c)^6\\). But that doesn't make sense because the coefficient should be a numerical value, not an expression involving \\(c\\). Hmm, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, perhaps the expression is a product, and when we expand it, each term will be a product of a term from \\((a + b)^4\\) and a term from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is independent of \\(c\\), we need to consider all the ways that \\(a^2b^2\\) can be multiplied by any term from the second expression. So, the coefficient would be \\(6\\) (from \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part, because each term in the second part is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, but the second part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), when expanded, has terms with different powers of \\(c\\), but the coefficients are all \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}\\). So, the sum of all coefficients in the second part is when we set \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). But that seems high. Alternatively, maybe I'm supposed to consider that when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expression, the \\(c\\) terms just add to the coefficient, so the coefficient is \\(6\\) times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is indeed \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Maybe the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which would be the product of the coefficients from each part. But that doesn't make sense because the two parts are being multiplied, so the coefficients would multiply as well. Wait, but in reality, when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficients of the product are the convolutions of the coefficients of the individual polynomials. But in this case, since we're looking for a specific term \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), we can think of it as the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all coefficients from the second part, because each term in the second part will multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. So, as I thought before, the coefficient would be \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). Wait, but let me test this with a simpler example. Suppose we have \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, expanding, we get \\((a^2 + 2ab + b^2) \\times (c + 1/c)\\). The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in this product would be zero because there's no \\(a^2b^2\\) term. Wait, but in this case, the second part is linear in \\(c\\), so when we multiply, each term in the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part, but \\(a^2b^2\\) isn't present. So, maybe my approach is wrong. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is that \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term that only comes from \\((a + b)^4\\), and when multiplied by any term from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the \\(c\\) terms just add to the coefficient, but since we're only looking for \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\), the coefficient would be \\(6\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But in the simpler example, \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is zero because there's no such term. Wait, so perhaps my approach is incorrect. Maybe I need to consider that the entire expression is a product, and \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term that exists only in \\((a + b)^4\\), and when multiplied by any term from the second expression, it becomes \\(a^2b^2\\) times some power of \\(c\\). But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), that would mean we have to sum over all possible powers of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which is 64, giving 384. But in the simpler case, that approach would give a non-zero coefficient when in reality, \\(a^2b^2\\) isn't present. So, perhaps I'm making a mistake here. Alternatively, maybe the problem is intended to have the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\). In that case, we would need to find the term where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out. So, in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero is when \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), so \\(k = 3\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire product would be \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). But the problem didn't specify anything about \\(c\\), just \\(a^2b^2\\). Hmm, maybe the problem is intended to ignore the \\(c\\) terms, so the coefficient is just 6. But that seems unlikely because the expression includes the \\(c\\) terms. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expression, which is 6 times 64, which is 384. But in the simpler example, that approach doesn't work because in \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be zero, but according to that approach, it would be 1 times 2 = 2, which is incorrect. So, perhaps the correct approach is to realize that since we're looking for \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient would be the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all coefficients from the second part. But in the simpler example, that gives an incorrect result, so maybe that approach is wrong. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to have the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), meaning that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients from the second part, which is 6 times 64, which is 384. But I'm not entirely sure. Let me check another way. Let me think of the entire product as a polynomial in \\(a, b, c\\). The term \\(a^2b^2\\) can come from multiplying \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part with any term from the second part. So, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Since the second part is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the sum of its coefficients is obtained by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\(2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient would be \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). So, I think that's the correct approach.

But since we're only interested in \\(a^2b^2\\), which comes from \\((a + b)^4\\), the \\(c\\) terms in the second expansion will just be coefficients multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, but that would mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 times the sum of all the terms in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that can't be right because each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) would contribute a coefficient, and when multiplied by 6, would affect the overall coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, but actually, since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, maybe the coefficient is just 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that seems a bit off. Alternatively, perhaps the \\(c\\) terms don't affect the \\(a^2b^2\\) term because they're separate variables. Wait, no, because when you multiply out the two expressions, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by every term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But wait, the sum of all coefficients in a polynomial is found by setting all variables to 1. So, if I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) becomes \\((1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 * 64 = 384. But wait, let me check that again.

Since we're only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and the other part is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is independent of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), perhaps the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is simply 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would mean that the coefficient includes all the terms from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which would make the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so perhaps it's just 6 times the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, maybe I'm supposed to consider that the coefficient is 6 times the entire expression \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but that doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, not an expression.

Let me see if that makes sense. Alternatively, maybe I should consider that when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion is multiplied by every term in the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384. So, the coefficient is 384. Wait, but let me double-check that. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\).

Wait, perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. But that doesn't make much sense because the product will have terms involving both \\(a, b, c\\). Wait, maybe the question is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where \\(c\\) cancels out, so the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. That would make sense because otherwise, the coefficient would involve terms with different powers of \\(c\\). So, perhaps I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product. Let me check the problem again: it says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\". Hmm, maybe it's assuming that \\(c\\) is a separate variable and that we're only looking at the coefficient in the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) part, but that doesn't seem right. Alternatively, perhaps the question is only considering the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) part and ignoring the \\(c\\) part. But that would be unusual. Alternatively, maybe the problem is written in a way that the entire expression is considered, and we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. But that would mean that the coefficient is actually a polynomial in \\(c\\), which is not typical. Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again. The problem is: What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, maybe it's just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating \\(c\\) as another variable. So, when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum of the products of the coefficients of terms whose variables multiply to give that term. So, in this case, to get \\(a^2b^2\\), we need to take the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from \\((a + b)^4\\) and multiply it by every term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that's not correct because each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) has a coefficient, and when multiplied by 6, contributes to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. So, the total coefficient would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But the sum of the coefficients in a polynomial is found by setting all variables to 1. So, in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), setting \\(c = 1\\) gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the sum of the coefficients is 64. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times 64, which is 384. Wait, but that seems too straightforward. Alternatively, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me think again. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from \\((a + b)^4\\), and it's multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is indeed the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of the coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Since the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the sum of coefficients in the second part is 64, the total coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384. So, I think that's the answer. But let me verify this another way. Let's consider that when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a term is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each polynomial, provided their variables multiply to give the desired term. So, in this case, to get \\(a^2b^2\\), we take \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first polynomial and any term from the second polynomial. Since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the term from the second polynomial can be any term, but since we're only interested in the coefficient, it's the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 * 64 = 384.

Next, we find the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) by setting \\(c = 1\\), resulting in \\(2^6 = 64\\). Multiplying these together gives \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n\\boxed{384}"

The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but in the entire product, each term would be of the form \\(a^2b^2 \\times c^k\\) for some \\(k\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).

So, if I have \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part with coefficient 6, and then the second part, when expanded, has a sum of coefficients equal to 64 (since \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\)), then the total coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 * 64 = 384.

Maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, so the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would have a coefficient that is a polynomial in \\(c\\).

Let me try another approach. Let's consider the entire expression as \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When expanding this, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part has a coefficient of 6, and each term in the second part is of the form \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - k} \\times \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, when we multiply 6 by each of these terms, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients from the second part, which is 6 * (sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)). As I calculated before, the sum of coefficients is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but another way to think about it is that since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\), then the coefficient would indeed be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, giving 384.\n\nSo, I think that's the correct approach. Therefore, the coefficient is 384.\n\nWait, but let me confirm this by actually expanding both parts. First, \\((a + b)^4\\) gives \\(a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. Now, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) can be expanded using the binomial theorem as \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). The sum of all the coefficients in this expansion is when we set \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, when we multiply the two expansions, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 * 64 = 384. That seems correct.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not missing anything. Another way to think about it is that when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum of the products of the coefficients of terms whose variables multiply to give that specific term. But in this case, since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient would be the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial and the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial. Because each term in the second polynomial, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), would contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, yes, that would be 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but maybe the problem is intended to have the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without considering any \\(c\\) terms, meaning that the coefficient is just 6, but that doesn't make sense because the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), so the coefficient would involve those terms. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, giving 384. So, I think that's the correct answer.\n\nWait, but let me think again. If I have two expressions, P(a, b) and Q(c), then the product P(a, b) * Q(c) would have terms like (terms from P) * (terms from Q). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in P(a, b) multiplied by the entire Q(c), because every term in Q(c) is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 * Q(c). But since the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, not a polynomial, perhaps it's considering the sum of all coefficients in Q(c), which is 64, leading to 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So, the coefficient is 384.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{384}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem.\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\), so the coefficient is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\n   \\]\n\n2. **Consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n   \\]\n   The sum of all coefficients in this expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives:\n   \\[\n   (1 + 1)^6 = 64\n   \\]\n\n3. **Combine the results:**\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 64 = 384\n   \\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{384}\\)."

    "text": " Wait, no, that might not be correct because the entire expression is a product of two expansions, so the coefficients from both parts contribute to the final coefficient. But since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the only way a term in the product can have \\(a^2b^2\\) is if we take the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from \\((a + b)^4\\) and multiply it by the constant term (i.e., the term with \\(c^0\\)) from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).

Then, multiply those two coefficients together to get the final coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression. Okay, so let me work on expanding \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem as well. The binomial expansion is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying that, each term becomes \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m} = \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\).

So, the coefficient from the \\(c\\) part is 20. Now, putting it all together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the two coefficients we found: 6 * 20 = 120.

That makes sense because any other term from the second expansion would introduce a \\(c\\) term, which isn't present in \\(a^2b^2\\). So, I think my approach is correct. Alternatively, if I were to expand the entire product, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term would only come from the product of \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part and the constant term from the second part. So, yes, 6 * 20 = 120. I think that's right.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Multiplying these gives the final coefficient as 120.\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{120}\n\\]"

    "text": " Wait, no, actually, when you multiply two expressions, each term from the first expression gets multiplied by each term from the second expression. So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I might have to consider that when I multiply by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), it's a polynomial in \\(c\\), but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), perhaps the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is just a scalar multiplier, and thus the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times whatever the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is? Wait, no, that might not be correct. Let me think again. Actually, when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. But in this case, \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) are being multiplied together. Since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) won't interact with those involving \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, is that right? Because each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but since we're only interested in the \\(a^2b^2\\) term, which comes from the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, no, that can't be because the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) has multiple terms, each with different powers of \\(c\\), but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of the coefficients of all terms in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that seems a bit off. Let me clarify: when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, if I have \\( (a + b)^4 = A + B + C + D + ... \\) where A is \\(a^4\\), B is \\(a^3b\\), etc., and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = E + F + G + H + ... \\), then the product will have terms like A*E, A*F, etc. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which comes from the term where the first polynomial contributes \\(a^2b^2\\) and the second polynomial contributes any term, because \\(a^2b^2\\) times anything will still have \\(a^2b^2\\), but wait, no, actually, \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term in the first polynomial, and when you multiply it by the entire second polynomial, it will create terms like \\(a^2b^2E\\), \\(a^2b^2F\\), etc. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product. Wait, but \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term in the first polynomial, and when you multiply by the second polynomial, which is in terms of \\(c\\), the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will be multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial. Wait, is that correct? Let me test with a simple example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^1 \\times (c + 1)^1 = (a + b)(c + 1)\\). The expansion is \\(a c + a + b c + b\\). The coefficient of \\(a\\) is \\(c + 1\\), which is the sum of coefficients in the second polynomial. Similarly, the coefficient of \\(b\\) is also \\(c + 1\\). So yes, in this case, the coefficient of \\(a\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(a\\) in the first polynomial times the sum of coefficients in the second polynomial. So, applying that to our problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, first, we found that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. Now, we need to find the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The sum of coefficients in a polynomial is found by plugging in 1 for all variables. So, let's set \\(c = 1\\). Then, \\(\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = (1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 * 64 = 384. Wait, but let me double-check that because sometimes when variables are involved, especially reciprocals, I might have made a mistake. Let me think again: when I set \\(c = 1\\), I get the sum of coefficients as 64, which seems correct because each term in the expansion would be evaluated at \\(c = 1\\), so \\(c^k * (1/c)^m\\) becomes 1. So, yes, the sum is 64. Therefore, multiplying 6 by 64 gives 384. So, the coefficient should be 384.\n\nWait, but hold on a second. I'm a bit confused because when I think about the product \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part would indeed multiply each term in the second part, so the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times each term in the second expansion, but since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, does that mean we have to consider that the \\(a^2b^2\\) term is multiplied by the entire second polynomial, and thus its coefficient becomes 6 times the sum of the coefficients of the second polynomial? Wait, that seems correct because each term in the second polynomial would multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term, so the coefficient would be 6 times each coefficient in the second polynomial, and when we collect like terms, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial. So, yes, that would be 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of it as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product being equal to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), because \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term without \\(c\\), so we need the terms in the second polynomial that don't involve \\(c\\), which is the term where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out, i.e., \\(c^0\\). So, let me check that approach too.\n\nIn \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(1/c\\right)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We want the term where the exponent is 0, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\), which is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Then, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times this 20. So, that would be 6 * 20 = 120. Wait, but that contradicts my earlier result of 384. Hmm, so now I'm confused. Which approach is correct?\n\nWait, let me think again. When I set \\(c = 1\\), I get the sum of all coefficients as 64, which includes all terms from \\(c^{-6}\\) up to \\(c^6\\). But when I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), perhaps I need to consider only the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero because that's the only term that, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), will result in a term that still has \\(a^2b^2\\). The other terms in the second polynomial would introduce \\(c\\) terms, which would make the overall term have \\(c\\) exponents, but since we're only interested in \\(a^2b^2\\), perhaps we should only consider the term where \\(c\\) cancels out, i.e., \\(c^0\\). So, that would be 20, and then the coefficient would be 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but that contradicts the earlier approach where I thought it was 384. So, which one is correct? Let me try to clarify.\n\nIn the product \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial will be multiplied by each term in the second polynomial, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) where \\(k\\) varies. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would only include the terms where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, because otherwise, the term would have \\(c\\) in it, making it \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), not just \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second polynomial. So, that would be 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought that the sum of coefficients in the second polynomial was 64, so 6 * 64 = 384, but that would imply that all terms in the second polynomial contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which isn't the case because \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term without \\(c\\), so only the term in the second polynomial that has \\(c^0\\) would multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) to give a term that's just \\(a^2b^2\\). The other terms would give terms like \\(a^2b^2c\\), \\(a^2b^2c^{-1}\\), etc., which aren't \\(a^2b^2\\), so their coefficients shouldn't be included. Therefore, the correct approach is to take the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial and multiply it by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second polynomial, which gives 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but then why did the first approach give me 384? Because I thought that the sum of coefficients in the second polynomial is 64, so multiplying 6 by 64 would give 384. But that would be correct if I was looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times any term, regardless of \\(c\\). But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a specific term without \\(c\\), I think the second approach is correct, and the answer should be 120.\n\nWait, let me test this with a simpler example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^1 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, the expansion is \\((a + b)(c + 1/c) = a c + a/c + b c + b/c\\). Now, the coefficient of \\(a\\) in this product is \\(c + 1/c\\), which is the same as the coefficient of \\(a\\) in the first polynomial times the entire second polynomial. But if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a\\) times \\(c^0\\), that would be just 1, because when \\(c = 1\\), the coefficient of \\(a\\) is 2, but if I'm only considering the term where \\(c^0\\), then it's 1. Wait, no, in this case, the coefficient of \\(a\\) times \\(c^0\\) would be 1, but the coefficient of \\(a\\) in the product is \\(c + 1/c\\), which isn't a constant. So, maybe in this case, the problem is that when we have variables involved, the concept of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is a bit different.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that the expression is a product of two polynomials, and the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the sum over all possible products of terms from each polynomial that result in \\(a^2b^2\\). But since the second polynomial is in terms of \\(c\\), which doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) is to take the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first polynomial and multiply it by any term from the second polynomial, but since the second polynomial doesn't have any \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), the coefficient would just be the coefficient from the first polynomial times the entire second polynomial. Wait, but that would mean the coefficient is 6 times the entire second polynomial, which would be a polynomial in \\(c\\), but the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, so perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is actually written as \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), and we're to consider this as a single expression, and find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 64, giving 384. But then, in the simple example I did earlier, \\((a + b)(c + 1/c)\\), the coefficient of \\(a\\) would be \\(c + 1/c\\), which is a polynomial, not a number. So, perhaps the problem is expecting a numerical coefficient, implying that we need to consider the term where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out, i.e., \\(c^0\\), so that the coefficient is a number, not a polynomial.\n\nWait, so perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be 6 * 20 = 120. But the problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", without mentioning \\(c\\), so maybe it's expecting 384, considering that \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by the entire second polynomial, making the coefficient a polynomial, but perhaps the problem is only interested in the coefficient as a number, so maybe 384 is correct.\n\nWait, I'm getting confused. Let me try to clarify: when you have an expression like \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second part, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), where \\(k\\) can be from -6 to 6. So, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), without any \\(c\\) terms, then we need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be the coefficient from the first part times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part, which is 20. So, 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, then it would be 6 times the entire second polynomial, which would make the coefficient a polynomial, but I think the problem expects a numerical coefficient, so I think it's 120.\n\nWait, but the problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", so perhaps it's considering the entire product, and the term \\(a^2b^2\\) can be combined with any power of \\(c\\), so the coefficient would be 6 times the entire second polynomial, which would have terms with \\(c\\). But that would mean the coefficient isn't a single number but a polynomial. However, the problem asks for \"the coefficient\", implying a numerical value, so perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is in the context where \\(c\\) is a variable, and we're supposed to treat \\(a^2b^2\\) as a term without any \\(c\\), so the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients of the second polynomial, which is 64, making it 384. So, perhaps the answer is 384.\n\nWait, but in the earlier example, \\((a + b)(c + 1/c)\\), the coefficient of \\(a\\) is \\(c + 1/c\\), which is a polynomial, not a number. So, perhaps in this problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is a polynomial, but the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, implying that we need to consider only the constant term in \\(c\\), i.e., \\(c^0\\), so the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, perhaps I should look for the term \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). That is, in the product, \\(a^2b^2\\) can be multiplied by any power of \\(c\\), so the coefficient would be 6 times the entire second polynomial, making it 6*(c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15/c^2 + 6/c^4 + 1/c^6). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be that polynomial. But the problem is asking for \"the coefficient\", so perhaps it's expecting a numerical coefficient, which would require us to consider only the constant term in \\(c\\), i.e., the term where \\(c^0\\), which is 20, so 6*20=120.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is intended to consider that \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are variables separate from \\(c\\), and that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the entire polynomial in \\(c\\), so the coefficient is 6*(c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15/c^2 + 6/c^4 + 1/c^6). But that seems unlikely because the problem asks for \"the coefficient\", which is usually a number, not a polynomial. So, I think the intended answer is 120.\n\nWait, to confirm, let me think of it this way: when you have two polynomials multiplied together, the coefficient of a specific term in one polynomial is multiplied by the entire other polynomial. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and when you multiply by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the coefficient becomes 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But if we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), then it's 6 times the entire second polynomial. However, if the problem is asking for the coefficient as a numerical value, then perhaps we need to evaluate the second polynomial at \\(c = 1\\), which gives 64, so 6*64=384.\n\nWait, but in the problem statement, it's written as \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, perhaps it's intended that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the sum of the coefficients of the second polynomial, which is 64, so 384.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to have the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be 6*20=120.\n\nI think I'm overcomplicating this. Let me look for similar problems or recall binomial theorem applications. When you have a product of two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in one polynomial is the product of that coefficient and the entire other polynomial. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would indeed be 6 times the entire second polynomial. But since the problem asks for \"the coefficient\", perhaps it's expecting a numerical value, so we set \\(c = 1\\) to get the sum of coefficients, which is 64, making the coefficient 6*64=384.\n\nBut then again, in the simple example, \\((a + b)(c + 1/c)\\), the coefficient of \\(a\\) is \\(c + 1/c\\), which is a polynomial, not a number. So, perhaps the problem is expecting a polynomial as the coefficient, but the problem statement says \"the coefficient\", which is usually a number. Therefore, I think the intended answer is 120, considering only the \\(c^0\\) term.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is from a source where variables are considered independent, and the coefficient is a polynomial, but since the problem didn't specify, it's safer to assume that it's expecting a numerical coefficient, so 120.\n\nWait, but let me check the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). The general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\times (1/c)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, the exponents go from \\(c^6\\) when \\(k=0\\) to \\(c^{-6}\\) when \\(k=6\\). The term where the exponent is 0 is when \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), so \\(k=3\\). So, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nYes, I think that's correct. So, the answer is 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem.\n\nFirst, we expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n\\]\nThe term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\), so the coefficient is:\n\\[\n\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\n\\]\n\nNext, we consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem, the general term is:\n\\[\n\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n\\]\nWe need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, which occurs when \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), giving \\(k = 3\\). The coefficient of this term is:\n\\[\n\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\n\\]\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is the product of the coefficients found above:\n\\[\n6 \\times 20 = 120\n\\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}."

    "text": " Wait, no, actually, no. Because when you multiply two expressions together, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second. So, if I have \\((a + b)^4\\) times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), then each term from the first expansion is multiplied by each term from the second expansion. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), we can consider that term separately, and the rest of the terms in the second expansion might not affect it. Wait, but no, that's not quite right. Because when you multiply, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part will be multiplied by every term in the second part. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. But wait, that doesn't make sense because the second part doesn't have any \\(a\\) or \\(b\\) terms. So, actually, when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by the second expression, it's just \\(a^2b^2\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since we're only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term without any \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), that would mean that the only way \\(a^2b^2\\) can appear in the product is if it's multiplied by 1 from the second expansion. But wait, the second expansion is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which doesn't have a constant term. So, is the coefficient zero? Wait, that can't be right because the problem is asking for it, so maybe I'm missing something. Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), the only way it can appear in the product is if it's multiplied by the constant term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because if you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by, say, \\(c^k\\), you'd get \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), which isn't \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the only term that would contribute to \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the term where \\(k = 0\\), i.e., the constant term from the second expansion. So, first, I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me expand that using the binomial theorem. \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, i.e., \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\), which is \\(\\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20. Now, going back to the original product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by the constant term 20 from the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Wait, that seems straightforward, but let me check if I missed anything.

    "text": " Wait, no, actually, since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and the other part is multiplied by that, maybe I don't need to consider the \\(c\\) terms at all because they don't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me think again. So, the expression is \\((a + b)^4\\) times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When you multiply two polynomials, each term from the first polynomial gets multiplied by each term from the second polynomial. But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I can just take the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) for \\(a^2b^2\\), which is 6, and then multiply it by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but wait, no, that doesn't make sense because the problem is probably treating the entire expression as a product and looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. Alternatively, maybe the \\(c\\) terms can be considered separately, but since they don't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), they just contribute a scalar multiple. Wait, no, that's not right. The entire expression is a product of two polynomials, so the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by every term in the \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) expansion. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, that doesn't seem right because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would be a term that includes \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by some combination of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) terms. But if the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, then perhaps we can treat the entire \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) as a scalar, but that doesn't make sense because the coefficient would then depend on \\(c\\). Alternatively, maybe the problem is only considering the terms where \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) multiply in such a way that they become a constant, like \\(c^0\\), so that the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by a constant. Wait, that might make sense. Let me think: if I have \\((a + b)^4\\) times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), and I want the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), then I need to consider all the terms in the expansion where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by terms in the \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) that result in a constant (i.e., \\(c^0\\)), because otherwise, the term would still have \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), and thus wouldn't be a pure \\(a^2b^2\\) term. So, perhaps I should first find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), and then multiply that by the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) from \\((a + b)^4\\). That sounds plausible. Let me try that approach. So, first, let's find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We want the exponent of \\(c\\) to be 0, so set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\) so \\(m = 3\\). So, the term where \\(m = 3\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} c^{0}\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Now, going back to the original expression, \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), when we expand it, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But we only want the terms where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0 because that's the only way \\(a^2b^2\\) will be a standalone term without any \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the coefficient from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) where \\(c^0\\), which is 6 times 20, so 120. Wait, but let me make sure. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it, and the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. But that doesn't make sense because the product would include terms with \\(c\\). So, perhaps the problem is considering the entire product and wants the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), not a scalar. So, perhaps the problem is only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\). That makes more sense. So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times 20, which is 120. Alternatively, maybe I should consider the entire expansion. Let me try another approach. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). To find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I can consider that any term in the product will be of the form \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}a^{4 - k}b^k \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, to get \\(a^2b^2\\), we need \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\), as before. So, the coefficient from the first part is 6. Now, the second part, \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\), can have any exponent, but if we're only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) exponent, then the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. But wait, that would be 6 times \\(2^6 = 64\\), because \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) evaluated at \\(c = 1\\) is \\(2^6 = 64\\). But that would mean the coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384, which seems too high. Alternatively, maybe the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and the \\(c\\) terms are separate, so the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would make the coefficient a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't seem right because the problem is probably expecting a numerical coefficient. Therefore, I think the correct approach is to consider that the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, but since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), it's likely referring to the coefficient when considering all possible \\(c\\) terms. But that doesn't make sense because the coefficient would then be a polynomial. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating \\(c\\) as a variable separate from \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), so the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which would make the coefficient a polynomial. But that seems unlikely because the problem is asking for a coefficient, which is typically a scalar. So, perhaps I need to consider that the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\). In that case, as I calculated earlier, the coefficient would be 6 * 20 = 120. Let me check that again. So, in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term with \\(c^0\\) is when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), so \\(m = 3\\), and the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 * 20 = 120. Yes, that makes sense. So, the answer should be 120.\n\nWait, but let me think again. If I have \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), when I multiply them, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion is multiplied by every term in the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be \\(6 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that's not a scalar; it's a polynomial in \\(c\\). So, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which would mean that the coefficient is a polynomial. But that doesn't seem right because the problem is probably expecting a numerical coefficient. Therefore, I think the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\). In that case, the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120. Alternatively, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without considering \\(c\\), then it would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which would be 6*(2^6) = 6*64 = 384. But that seems too large, and also, the problem is probably expecting a single number, so I think the first interpretation is correct: the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nWait, but let me make sure. Let's think about how the product works. When you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion will be multiplied by every term in the second expansion, which includes various powers of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would actually be a sum of terms involving different powers of \\(c\\). But if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), without specifying anything about \\(c\\), then it's ambiguous. However, in most cases, when a problem asks for the coefficient of a term in a product involving multiple variables, they are looking for the coefficient when considering all variables. But in this case, since \\(a^2b^2\\) is part of the product, and the other part is in terms of \\(c\\), perhaps the problem is expecting the coefficient to be a polynomial in \\(c\\). But that seems unlikely because the problem is probably expecting a numerical coefficient. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only considering the terms where \\(c\\) cancels out, i.e., \\(c^0\\), so that the term is \\(a^2b^2\\) times a constant. In that case, the coefficient would be 6 * 20 = 120. I think that's the most reasonable interpretation. So, I'll go with 120 as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, considering only the constant term with respect to \\(c\\).\n\nWait, but to be thorough, let me check another approach. Suppose I treat the entire expression as a product and look for the term \\(a^2b^2\\). Since the problem doesn't specify anything about \\(c\\), maybe it's considering the coefficient as a polynomial in \\(c\\). But that would mean the coefficient is 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which would be a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient, which is usually a scalar, so I think the intended interpretation is that we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\). Therefore, the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but let me confirm by expanding both parts. The expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) gives \\(a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). The expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) gives \\(c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15\\dfrac{1}{c^2} + 6\\dfrac{1}{c^4} + \\dfrac{1}{c^6}\\). Now, when you multiply these two expansions together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times each term in the second expansion. So, the coefficient would be \\(6c^6 + 36c^4 + 90c^2 + 120 + 90\\dfrac{1}{c^2} + 36\\dfrac{1}{c^4} + 6\\dfrac{1}{c^6}\\). Therefore, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), it's actually this entire expression. But that seems too complicated, and the problem is likely expecting a numerical coefficient. Therefore, I think the problem is intended to ask for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. So, I'll go with 120 as the final answer.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplying it by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20. Thus, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer:** \\(\\boxed{120}\\)"

    "text": " Wait, no, because when we multiply, each term in the first expansion gets multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), maybe we can ignore the \\(c\\) terms and just take the coefficient from the first part? Wait, that doesn't seem right because the second part is also a binomial expansion, and when we multiply, every term from the first expansion is multiplied by every term from the second. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term without \\(c\\), perhaps the only way that happens is if the term from the second expansion is a constant term, i.e., the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. Because if the second expansion has a term with \\(c^k\\), then when we multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), we'd get \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), which isn't just \\(a^2b^2\\). So, perhaps the coefficient we're looking for is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part. Because \\(c^0 = 1\\), so that term is just a constant. So, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me think about that. Again, using the binomial theorem, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying that, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m} = \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, we need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be zero, which means \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient from the second part is 20. Now, since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which comes from the first part, and we're multiplying it by the constant term from the second part, which is 20, the overall coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't miss anything. So, when we multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the term where we take \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion and multiply it by \\(c^0\\) from the second expansion. All other terms from the second expansion would introduce a \\(c\\) term, which would make the product have a \\(c\\) component, which we don't want. So, yes, only the constant term from the second expansion contributes to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120. So, I think that's the answer. Wait, just to double-check, maybe I can think of it another way. Let's consider the entire expansion of both parts. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, as we found. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) has terms with various powers of \\(c\\), but when we multiply, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part will be multiplied by every term in the second expansion. However, only the term where \\(c^0\\) contributes to the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the product because any other power of \\(c\\) would change the variables in the term, making it something like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), which isn't just \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, only the constant term from the second expansion affects the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. So, the coefficient is indeed 6 * 20 = 120. I think that makes sense. So, the final answer should be 120.\n\nWait, but let me check my math again to be sure. So, \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) is indeed 6, and \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\) is 20. Multiplying them gives 120, which seems correct. So, yeah, I think I'm confident that the coefficient is 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem.\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\):\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\n   \\]\n   So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\n2. **Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n   \\]\n   We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero:\n   \\[\n   6 - 2m = 0 \\implies m = 3\n   \\]\n   The coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\n   \\]\n\n3. **Combine the results:**\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the product of the coefficients from each expansion:\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 20 = 120\n   \\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

So, perhaps the coefficient is just the product of the coefficient from \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and the entire expansion of the second part. Wait, that doesn't make sense because the second part is also being expanded. Hmm, maybe I need to consider that when I multiply the two expansions, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by every term in the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the sum of all coefficients in the second part. But that can't be right because the second part is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which when expanded has terms involving various powers of \\(c\\). Wait, but the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, actually, every term in the product that has \\(a^2b^2\\) will be of the form \\(a^2b^2 \\times\\) some term from the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all coefficients from the second part. But wait, that's not correct because the second part's coefficients depend on the powers of \\(c\\). Alternatively, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, perhaps it's considering the entire expression, and we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in other words, when we multiply the two expansions, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Wait, no, that's not quite right. The sum of all coefficients in the second part would be when we set \\(c = 1\\), but that's not exactly what we need here. Let me think again. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient from the first part times the entire expansion of the second part, but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), it's actually the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Because each term in the second expansion will multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term, so the total coefficient would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion. Wait, but the second expansion is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). The sum of its coefficients is obtained by setting \\(c = 1\\), so that would be \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 * 64 = 384. Hmm, that seems plausible, but let me check if that's correct. Alternatively, maybe I'm supposed to consider that the second expansion contributes a factor that doesn't affect the \\(a^2b^2\\) term, so the coefficient remains 6. But that doesn't seem right because the entire expression is a product, so the coefficients would multiply. Wait, no, because the second expansion is being multiplied by each term in the first expansion. So, for each term in the first expansion, like \\(a^2b^2\\), it's multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all coefficients in the second part. So, as I thought earlier, 6 * 64 = 384. But let me confirm this approach. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by any power of \\(c\\), so in that case, the coefficient would just be 6 times the entire expansion of the second part. But that doesn't make sense because the coefficient should be a number, not an expression. Wait, no, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in the product, each term will have some power of \\(c\\), but the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the sum of all the coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by 6. So, yes, 6 times 64 is 384. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without considering \\(c\\), which would mean that the coefficient is 6, and the \\(c\\) terms are separate. But that seems unlikely because the problem includes the entire expression. Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me try to think differently. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). When you expand this, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first part, and it's multiplied by every term from the second part. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. The sum of all coefficients in the second expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient would be 6 * 64 = 384. So, I think that's the answer. But let me double-check. Alternatively, perhaps I'm supposed to consider that the second expansion is separate, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just 6, and the \\(c\\) terms are part of the overall expression but don't affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, that doesn't make sense because when you multiply, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by every term in the second expansion, each of which has a coefficient. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is indeed 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. So, I think that's the correct approach.

    "text": " Wait, no, actually, no, because when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first polynomial gets multiplied by each term in the second. But since we're only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and the second part involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), which don't affect the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), maybe the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't seem right because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, not an expression involving \\(c\\). Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" Oh! Wait, maybe the entire expression is a product, and we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, that would mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the sum of all the terms in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that can't be right because that would involve an infinite series or something. Wait, no, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is a finite expansion. Let me think again. Maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me try to break it down.\n\nSo, the expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When I expand this, each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), we can consider that term separately. So, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, as I found earlier. Now, when we multiply this by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). However, since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, and \\(a^2b^2\\) is independent of \\(c\\), the coefficient would actually be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, that doesn't make sense because \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) has terms with different powers of \\(c\\), but when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), each term would contribute a coefficient. But actually, when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), you get terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for different \\(k\\). But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). Wait, no, that can't be right because \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term on its own, and when multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), it becomes \\(a^2b^2\\) times that expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would actually be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that can't be, because the coefficient should be a number, not an expression involving \\(c\\). I must be misunderstanding something.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some specific \\(k\\)? But no, the problem just says \\(a^2b^2\\), without mentioning \\(c\\). So, maybe the problem is considering the entire product, and \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), so when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), you get \\(a^2b^2\\) times the sum of all terms in that expansion. But that would mean the coefficient is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), so that would be \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times 64, which is 384. But that seems too high. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think again.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, in other words, when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But as I thought earlier, the sum of the coefficients is 64, so 6 times 64 is 384. But let me check that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm supposed to treat the entire product as a single expression and find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 6 times 64, which is 384. But let me verify this.\n\nWait, another approach: The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When you expand this, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\) with coefficient 6, and it's multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is indeed found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, 6 times 64 is 384. Therefore, the coefficient is 384.\n\nWait, but I'm not sure if this is correct because when you have \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), it's a Laurent polynomial, meaning it has terms with both positive and negative exponents of \\(c\\). So, when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by this, you get \\(a^2b^2\\) times a sum of terms with different powers of \\(c\\). So, in the entire product, \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each of those terms, but the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually be the sum of all those coefficients because each term is a separate term in the product. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 6 times 64, which is 384.\n\nBut let me think again: when you have two separate expressions multiplied together, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each factor. But in this case, \\(a^2b^2\\) is only in the first factor, and the second factor doesn't have any \\(a\\) or \\(b\\). So, when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by the entire second factor, you're effectively scaling \\(a^2b^2\\) by the entire second expression. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the entire second expression. But the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, so perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\), which is 1. That would make sense because then we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\). So, in that case, we need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), and then multiply that by 6.\n\nSo, let's try that approach. First, find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). To do that, we can use the binomial theorem again. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so we set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire product is 6 times 20, which is 120.\n\nWait, that makes more sense. So, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. I think that's the correct approach. Let me double-check.\n\nSo, in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), so \\(k = 3\\), and the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Then, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, the final answer should be 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplying it by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20. Thus, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\boxed{120}"

Wait, no, that's not correct either because each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) has its own coefficient, and when you multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), it would be \\(a^2b^2\\) times each term from the \\(c\\) expansion.

Wait, but that might not be the case. Alternatively, perhaps the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because each term in the \\(c\\) expansion would multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term, effectively. But that seems a bit off because the \\(c\\) terms could have negative exponents, so maybe some terms would cancel out. Wait, let me think again. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When you multiply these together, each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by every term from the second part. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 (from \\(a^2b^2\\)) multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that can't be correct because the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) would be obtained by setting \\(c = 1\\), right? Because substituting \\(c = 1\\) gives you the sum of the coefficients. So, if I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 times 64, which is 384. But wait, that seems too straightforward, and I'm not sure if I'm missing something. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which would mean that each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), so the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion. But that would make the coefficient a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. So, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Wait, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, but since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient would just be 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would make the coefficient a polynomial, not a single number. Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when considering the entire expression, which includes the \\(c\\) terms. But since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are different variables, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the product of the coefficients from each part. So, the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the coefficient from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is... Wait, but \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) expands to terms involving various powers of \\(c\\), but since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), perhaps the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in the \\(c\\) expansion. Because each term in the \\(c\\) expansion would multiply \\(a^2b^2\\), so the total coefficient would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the \\(c\\) part. As I thought earlier, the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is obtained by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives 64. So, 6 times 64 is 384. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 384.\n\nWait, but let me check this again because I might be making a mistake. So, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When we expand this, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) has a coefficient of 6, and it is multiplied by every term in the \\(c\\) expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the \\(c\\) expansion. As I calculated before, the sum of the coefficients in the \\(c\\) expansion is 64, so 6 times 64 is indeed 384. Therefore, the coefficient is 384.\n\nWait, but maybe I should approach it differently. Let's consider that the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). To find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I can treat the \\(c\\) terms as separate and just focus on the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) part. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and since the \\(c\\) part is multiplied by it, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the \\(c\\) expansion, which is 64, giving 384. Alternatively, maybe I should think of it as the product of the two expansions, and the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the product of the coefficients from each part. Since the \\(c\\) part doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms, the coefficient is just 6 times whatever the sum of the coefficients in the \\(c\\) part is. So, yes, 6 times 64 is 384.\n\nWait, but let me make sure. Let's consider a simpler case. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, expanding, we get \\((a^2 + 2ab + b^2) \\times (c + 1/c)\\). The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in this case would be zero because there's no \\(a^2b^2\\) term. Wait, but that's a different example. Alternatively, maybe I should think of it as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) being 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the \\(c\\) expansion because each term in the \\(c\\) expansion is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), making the coefficient a polynomial in \\(c\\), but the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would be a term that includes all possible powers of \\(c\\). But that doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, not a polynomial. So, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\). That would make more sense because then the coefficient would be a number. So, in that case, I would need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\) in the entire expression. That would require me to consider both expansions and find the product term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\). So, the coefficient would be 6 (from \\(a^2b^2\\)) multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). That makes more sense. So, let me correct my approach. First, find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6. Then, find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Once I have both coefficients, multiply them together to get the final coefficient for \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire expression.\n\nSo, let's find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We want the exponent of \\(c\\) to be 0, so we set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n\nSo, now, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficients from each part, which is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nWait, that makes more sense. So, I think I made a mistake earlier by considering the sum of all coefficients in the \\(c\\) expansion, but actually, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), so I need to find the specific term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. That changes things. So, the correct approach is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part, which is 20, and then multiply them together to get 120.\n\nLet me verify this again. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\) with a coefficient of 6. The term \\(c^0\\) comes from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) with a coefficient of 20. So, when you multiply these two terms together, you get \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\) as the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is the same as \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient is 120.\n\nI think that's the correct approach. Earlier, I thought the problem was asking for the coefficient regardless of \\(c\\), but now I realize that since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), it must be multiplied by \\(c^0\\), so the coefficient is 6 times 20, which is 120.\n\nSo, to summarize:\n\n1. Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is 6.\n2. Expand \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\), which is 20.\n3. Multiply these two coefficients together to get the final coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, which is 120.\n\nYes, that makes sense now. I think 120 is the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\), and then finding the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying these together gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

    "text": " Wait, no, that's not quite right. Let me think again. The entire expression is a product of two parts: \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when you multiply them together, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), that means we need to find the term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) that has \\(c^0\\), because \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\) would just be \\(a^2b^2\\). So, I think I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) and then multiply it by the coefficient from \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which we found to be 6. So, let me first find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).

Therefore, the constant term is when \\(m = 3\\), and the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20. Now, going back to the original expression, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the constant term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). That is, 6 times 20, which is 120. Wait, but let me make sure I'm not missing anything. So, the expansion is \\((a + b)^4\\) times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), and when we multiply them, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second. But since we're only interested in the term that results in \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), we just need the product of the coefficients from each part, right? Because \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), so the only term in the second expansion that contributes is the constant term. Therefore, the total coefficient is indeed 6 times 20, which is 120. Hmm, that seems correct. Let me just check my steps again. First, I found the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial coefficient \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Then, I found the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) by solving \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which gave \\(m = 3\\), and the coefficient there is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying these together, 6 * 20 = 120. Yes, that makes sense. I don't think I made any mistakes in the calculations. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is found by first determining the coefficient in \\((a + b)^4\\) and then multiplying it by the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\n1.

Actually, when you multiply two expressions, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression.

So, in other words, we need to find the term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) that has \\(c^0\\), because \\(c^0 = 1\\), which doesn't affect the term. So, let's find that term. Using the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\).

But wait, no, that doesn't make sense because the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) would contribute terms with \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), but since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), we're just looking for the coefficient when \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by whatever term in the second expansion. Wait, but actually, no. When you multiply two polynomials, the coefficients multiply. So, if I have \\((a + b)^4\\) which has a term \\(6a^2b^2\\), and then I multiply it by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is another polynomial, then the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by every term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since we're only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), we need to see if any of these multiplications result in \\(a^2b^2\\) times something that would cancel out the \\(c\\) terms. Wait, no. Because \\(a^2b^2\\) is just a term without \\(c\\), so when we multiply by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which has terms with different powers of \\(c\\), each term in the product will have \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by some power of \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms? Or is it asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, which would include terms with \\(c\\)? Wait, the problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", so I think it's considering the entire expression, which includes \\(c\\) terms. But \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), so actually, in the product, each term will be of the form \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some integer \\(k\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that can't be right because the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't make sense because the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) would be when \\(c = 1\\), which is \\(2^6 = 64\\). So, would the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) be \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\)? Wait, but that seems too high. Let me think again. Maybe I'm overcomplicating this. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, in the product, each term from \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But since we're only interested in terms where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2 each, the \\(c\\) terms can be anything, but the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Wait, no, that's not quite right. Because when you multiply, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), we need to consider that each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term without \\(c\\). Wait, but in the product, \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would actually be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would mean that the coefficient is not just a number, but a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for a coefficient, which is a number, so perhaps it's considering the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, maybe the coefficient is the product of the coefficients from each part. Wait, but that would mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). The sum of coefficients in a polynomial is found by setting all variables to 1. So, if we set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = (1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of coefficients is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 * 64 = 384. But wait, that seems too straightforward. Let me check again. Alternatively, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question. Maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, treating \\(c\\) as a variable, so we have to consider that each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), and we need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). But in that case, the coefficient would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which would make the coefficient a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for a coefficient, which is a number, so maybe it's considering the coefficient when you collect like terms, meaning that \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by all possible \\(c\\) terms, so the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would make the coefficient a polynomial, not a number. So, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating all variables as separate, so the coefficient would be the product of the coefficients from each part. Wait, but that's not correct because when you multiply two polynomials, each term from the first is multiplied by each term from the second, so the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each polynomial. But in this case, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), so in the product, it's \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient would be 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient, which is a number, so perhaps I'm missing something. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, which would include all possible powers of \\(c\\). But in that case, the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), not a number. So, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), ignoring the \\(c\\) part, which would be 6. But that seems too simple, and the presence of the \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) term suggests that it's part of the problem. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, considering all possible terms, but since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient would just be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient would be 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that's a polynomial, not a number. So, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when you expand the entire expression, treating all variables as separate, so the coefficient is 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that seems unlikely because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. Alternatively, maybe the problem is miswritten, and it's supposed to be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where \\(c\\) cancels out, but that's just a guess. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, so it's 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 times 64, which is 384. That seems plausible. Let me check that approach again. If I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = 64\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when \\(c = 1\\) would be 6 * 64 = 384. But that's only when \\(c = 1\\). Alternatively, if I consider the entire expansion, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient is 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial. But the problem is asking for a coefficient, which is a number, so perhaps the answer is 6 times 64, which is 384. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating this, and the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and the rest is irrelevant because the problem is miswritten. But that seems unlikely. Let me try another approach. Let's consider that the expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). When we expand this, each term will be of the form \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}a^{4 - k}b^k \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - m}(1/c)^m = \\dbinom{4}{k}\\dbinom{6}{m}a^{4 - k}b^k c^{6 - 2m}\\). Now, we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, we need \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). So, \\(k = 2\\), and then for each \\(m\\) from 0 to 6, we have terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^{6 - 2m}\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the sum over all \\(m\\) of \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\dbinom{6}{m}\\) times the coefficient of \\(c^{6 - 2m}\\). Wait, but that's not quite right because the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for a coefficient, which is a number, so perhaps it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when considering all possible terms, but that would still be a polynomial. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable, so the coefficient is \\(6 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial, but the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, which suggests that perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, so it's 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 times 64, which is 384. That seems plausible. Let me verify this by considering that when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term is the product of the coefficients from each polynomial. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the coefficient of any term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is a number, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). The sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\(2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).

Let me check that logic again. If I have two terms, one from each expansion, say \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first and \\(c^k\\) from the second, then when multiplied together, I get \\(a^2b^2c^k\\). But since the problem only wants the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), that would mean \\(k\\) must be 0, so that \\(c^k = c^0 = 1\\), which doesn't change the \\(a^2b^2\\) term.

So, now, let's find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Again, using the binomial theorem, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying that, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\times c^{-m} = \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be 0, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\).

Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, maybe the question is treating \\(c\\) as a variable, and \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) as separate variables, so when we multiply out the entire expression, we're looking for the term that has \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by some power of \\(c\\). Wait, but that might not make sense because \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term, and the other part is in \\(c\\), so maybe the coefficient is just 6 times the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't seem right because the coefficient should be a number, not an expression. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, treating \\(c\\) as another variable. So, maybe we need to find all terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present, regardless of the power of \\(c\\). But that would mean that the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that also seems off because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would include all possible powers of \\(c\\). But that's not how coefficients work; each term has its own coefficient depending on the variables. Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try a different approach. Let's consider that the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when we expand this, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion comes with a coefficient of 6, as we found earlier. Then, this 6 will be multiplied by every term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be 6 times each term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for any \\(k\\) would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^k\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), without specifying any particular power of \\(c\\). That suggests that we might need to sum over all possible coefficients of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), but that doesn't make much sense because the coefficient depends on \\(k\\). Alternatively, maybe the problem is considering \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) as separate variables, and it's asking for the coefficient of the term \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). But in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, not an expression involving \\(c\\). So, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me check again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" Maybe the problem is expecting us to consider that \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are all variables, and it's asking for the coefficient of the term where \\(a\\) is squared, \\(b\\) is squared, and \\(c\\) is to some power. But without specifying the power of \\(c\\), it's unclear. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, and so the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) would be found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\( (1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, 6 times 64 would be 384. But that seems high, and I'm not sure if that's the correct approach. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by \\(c^0\\), i.e., the constant term in \\(c\\). That would make sense because then we're looking for the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\), which is the constant term. So, let's try that approach. So, first, find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6. Then, find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Then, multiply those two coefficients together. So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) can be found using the binomial theorem. The general term in the expansion is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We want the exponent of \\(c\\) to be 0, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\). So, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire expression is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). So, the answer should be 120. Wait, but let me double-check. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), which would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that would result in a polynomial, not a single number. So, that can't be right. Therefore, I think the correct approach is to consider the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\), giving a coefficient of 120. So, I think the answer is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then finding the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20. Multiplying these gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\boxed{120}"

But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term without any \\(c\\), that means we need to find the constant term in the second expansion, because only the constant term (i.e., the term with \\(c^0\\)) will result in a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the constant term in the second part. Therefore, I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me figure that out. Again, using the binomial theorem, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We want the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, because that's the constant term. So, set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which gives \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} c^{0} = \\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficients from each part, which is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the second part). So, 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120. Wait, but let me double-check. So, in the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6. In the second part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the constant term is 20. So when we multiply these two, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion is multiplied by the constant term 20 from the second expansion, resulting in \\(20a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient is 20 * 6 = 120.

So, actually, I think I was wrong before. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me calculate that.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, when you expand this, each term from \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), we need to find the term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) that is a constant term, i.e., the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. Because when you multiply that by \\(a^2b^2\\), it will give you a term that's \\(a^2b^2\\) times that constant, so that's the only term that contributes to \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, first, as I found earlier, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. Now, I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Let's expand that using the binomial theorem. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(1/c\\right)^m\\). Simplifying that, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\times c^{-m} = \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the exponent of \\(c\\) in each term is \\(6 - 2m\\). We need the term where the exponent is zero because that's the constant term. So, set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is when \\(m = 3\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the two coefficients: 6 (from \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\)) and 20 (the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\)). So, 6 times 20 is 120. Therefore, the coefficient is 120.\n\nWait, let me double-check that. So, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). In \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the constant term occurs when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, which is when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), so \\(m = 3\\). The coefficient there is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying these together gives 6 * 20 = 120. That seems correct. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120.\n\nBut wait, let me make sure I didn't miss anything. The problem is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). When you multiply these two expressions, each term from the first is multiplied by each term from the second. But since we're only interested in the term that has \\(a^2b^2\\), we only need the constant term from the second expression, because any \\(c\\) terms would introduce \\(c\\) into the term, which we don't want.

But that's not the same as the constant term. The constant term is 20, as calculated earlier. So, I think the correct approach is to take the constant term from the second expression, which is 20, and multiply by the coefficient from the first expression, which is 6, giving 120.\n\nI think that's solid.

So, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that seems unlikely because the problem is presented as a single term. Alternatively, maybe the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), because \\(c^0 = 1\\), so that term would be just \\(a^2b^2\\). So, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which would involve taking the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) and multiplying it by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). That makes more sense. So, let me try that approach. So, first, find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which we found earlier as 6. Then, find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Then, multiply those two coefficients together to get the final coefficient for \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is just \\(a^2b^2\\). So, let me work on finding the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Again, using the binomial theorem, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(1/c\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be 0, so set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Now, the overall coefficient for \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is the product of the two coefficients we found: 6 and 20. So, 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120. Wait, but let me make sure I'm interpreting the problem correctly. The problem says, \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\).\" So, in the expanded form, each term will be of the form \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) where \\(k\\) can be positive or negative. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would include all the terms where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2, regardless of the exponent of \\(c\\). Wait, no, that's not right. Because if we're just looking for \\(a^2b^2\\), without any \\(c\\) terms, that would mean we need the term where \\(c^0\\), as I thought earlier. So, yes, the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120. Alternatively, if the problem was asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some specific \\(k\\), that would be different, but since it's just \\(a^2b^2\\), I think it refers to the constant term with respect to \\(c\\), meaning \\(c^0\\). So, I think 120 is the correct answer. Let me just recap to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. First, expand \\((a + b)^4\\) and find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is 6. Then, expand \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) and find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\), which is 20. Multiply them together to get 120. Yes, that seems correct. I don't think I made any calculation errors. The binomial coefficients are correct: 6 choose 2 is 15, wait, no, wait a second. Wait, 4 choose 2 is 6, right? Because 4! / (2!2!) = (24)/(2*2) = 6. Yes, that's correct. And 6 choose 3 is 20, because 6! / (3!3!) = 720 / (6*6) = 720 / 36 = 20. So, yes, that's correct. So, 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient is 120.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me think about it another way. Suppose I consider the entire product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Each term in the expansion is of the form \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}a^{4 - k}b^k \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, to get \\(a^2b^2\\), we need \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). So, that gives us the coefficient 6 from the first part. Then, for the second part, we need \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), so \\(m = 3\\), giving us 20. So, the combined coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120. Yes, that checks out. I think I'm confident that 120 is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem for both parts of the expression.\n\nFirst, consider the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\). Using the binomial theorem, we have:\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n\\]\nWe need the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which corresponds to \\(k = 2\\). The coefficient is:\n\\[\n\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\n\\]\n\nNext, consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).

Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(m = 3\\). The coefficient is:\n\\[\n\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\n\\]\n\nThe overall coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is the product of the two coefficients found:\n\\[\n6 \\times 20 = 120\n\\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}."

    "text": " Wait, no, actually, when you multiply two expressions together, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression. But since we're only looking for the term that has \\(a^2b^2\\), which comes from \\((a + b)^4\\), and the other part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would just be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but wait, that doesn't make sense because when you multiply, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second. But since we're only interested in \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), the \\(c\\) terms would contribute a factor that's multiplied by 1 for the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. Wait, no, that's not quite right. Let me think again. If I have \\((a + b)^4\\) times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), then when I expand both, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6\\(a^2b^2\\), and when I multiply it by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), it becomes 6\\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, that can't be right because then the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\), but the problem just asks for a numerical coefficient. Hmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me check again. The problem says: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, perhaps the question is treating \\(c\\) as a variable independent of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and it's asking for the coefficient of the term that has \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, in other words, when you multiply out the entire expression, you'll have terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for various \\(k\\), but the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the sum of all the coefficients from the \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) expansion, because each term in that expansion will multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term, contributing their coefficients to the overall coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients of all terms in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that seems a bit off. Let me think differently. Alternatively, maybe I can treat \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) as a constant with respect to \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be 6 times whatever \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) evaluates to. But that doesn't make much sense either because \\(c\\) is a variable, not a constant. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when considering all possible terms, regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, in other words, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients of each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but the sum of the coefficients of a polynomial is found by plugging in \\(c = 1\\). So, if I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 * 64 = 384. But wait, let me check that again. So, if I have \\((a + b)^4\\) times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), and I want the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), then in the product, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term would be multiplied by every term in the \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Since the sum of the coefficients is indeed 64, as calculated by setting \\(c = 1\\), then 6 * 64 = 384. So, the coefficient is 384. Wait, but let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is more straightforward. Since \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is being multiplied by \\((a + b)^4\\), and we're only interested in the \\(a^2b^2\\) term, which comes from the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) as 6\\(a^2b^2\\). Then, when you multiply this by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). As I thought earlier, the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, 6 * 64 = 384. Therefore, the coefficient is 384. Wait, but let me check if that's correct. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Perhaps the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, so it's just 6, because the \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) part doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. But that doesn't seem right because when you multiply, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6\\(a^2b^2\\), and when you multiply it by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), it becomes 6\\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would be 6 times the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), not a single number. So, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when considering the entire product, treating \\(c\\) as another variable. But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which seems unlikely because the problem just asks for a coefficient, implying a numerical value. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, meaning it's just 6, but that seems too simple. Wait, perhaps the problem is phrased as \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", which would mean that it's looking for the coefficient when considering all possible terms, including those involving \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. Therefore, the coefficient is 384. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting me to treat \\(c\\) as a separate variable and just recognize that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, because the other part doesn't affect it. But I think that's not the case because when you multiply two polynomials, each term in one is multiplied by each term in the other. So, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term would have a coefficient that's 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which would make the coefficient a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, so perhaps I'm missing something. Wait, maybe the problem is written as \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), and it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, perhaps the coefficient is 6, and the rest is ignored. But that seems incorrect because the entire expression would have terms involving \\(c\\), so the coefficient would depend on \\(c\\). Hmm, perhaps I should approach this differently. Let me consider the entire expansion. The product is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When I expand this, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\) with coefficient 6, and it's multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients of all terms in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). As I thought earlier, the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives 64. So, 6 * 64 = 384. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 384. Wait, but let me confirm this with an example. Suppose I have a simpler case: \\((a + b)^1 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^1 = (a + b)(c + 1/c)\\). The expansion would be \\(a c + a \\times 1/c + b c + b \\times 1/c\\). The coefficient of \\(a\\) is \\(c + 1/c\\), and the coefficient of \\(b\\) is also \\(c + 1/c\\). So, if I were to ask for the coefficient of \\(a\\) in this product, it would be \\(c + 1/c\\), which is a polynomial in \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient isn't a single number but a polynomial. But in the original problem, the answer is expected to be a numerical coefficient, so perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Alternatively, maybe the problem is written differently, and it's actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where the exponents of \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are 2, 2, and 0 respectively. In that case, we'd need to find the coefficient where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\), which is 1. So, that would require considering the term where in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0. Let me see, because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by \\(c^k\\), the exponent of \\(c\\) would be \\(k\\). So, to get \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), we need the term where \\(k = 0\\). So, the coefficient would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). That makes more sense because then the coefficient would be a number, not a polynomial. So, perhaps I misinterpreted the problem. It might be asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is the term where the exponents of \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are 2, 2, and 0 respectively. That would make the problem more interesting. So, let me approach it that way. First, find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, as before. Then, find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(c^0\\) is the constant term in that expansion. To find the constant term, we can use the binomial theorem again. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(1/c\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, we need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be 0, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which implies \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire product would be 6 * 20 = 120. So, the coefficient is 120. Wait, that makes more sense because it's a numerical value, and the problem is likely asking for that. So, perhaps I initially misread the problem, thinking it's only about \\(a^2b^2\\), but it's actually about \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). Therefore, the correct coefficient is 120.\n\nWait, but let me double-check this. If I have \\((a + b)^4\\) times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), and I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then yes, that would be the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part. So, 6 * 20 = 120. Alternatively, if the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), without considering \\(c\\), then the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial. But since the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, it's more likely that it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. Therefore, the final answer is 120.\n\nWait, but to be thorough, let me check the expansion again. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\) with coefficient 6. The term \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is when the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, which occurs when \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), so \\(k = 3\\). The coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, the product is 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is 120. So, I think that's the correct answer.\n\nWait, but let me think again. If the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, then it's 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But since the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, it must be asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. So, I think that's the correct interpretation.\n\nWait, but let me check the problem statement again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" It doesn't specify anything about \\(c\\), so maybe it's indeed asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, meaning it's 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. But then, the problem is expecting a numerical answer, so perhaps that's the case. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is written differently, and it's actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. Hmm, this is a bit confusing. Let me try to see if there's a way to interpret the problem that leads to a numerical answer. If the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, then it's 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, if it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it's 6 * 20 = 120. Which one is correct? I think it's more likely that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which would be 384, because if it was asking for \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), it would probably specify that. So, perhaps my initial approach was correct, and the answer is 384.\n\nWait, but let me think about this: when you have a product of two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in one polynomial is the sum of the products of that term's coefficient with each term's coefficient in the other polynomial. So, in this case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Because each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), so the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will have a coefficient that's 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial. Therefore, the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. Therefore, the coefficient is 384.\n\nBut wait, let me confirm this with an example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^1 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^1 = (a + b)(c + 1/c)\\). Expanding this, I get \\(a c + a/c + b c + b/c\\). Now, the coefficient of \\(a\\) is \\(c + 1/c\\), and the coefficient of \\(b\\) is also \\(c + 1/c\\). So, if I were to ask for the coefficient of \\(a\\), it's \\(c + 1/c\\), which is a polynomial in \\(c\\). So, in this case, the coefficient isn't a single number but a polynomial. Therefore, in the original problem, if it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), it's expecting a polynomial in \\(c\\), which is 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But since the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, that suggests that perhaps it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. So, perhaps the problem is intended to be interpreted that way. Alternatively, maybe the problem is written as \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), and it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. But since the problem is expecting a numerical answer, perhaps it's intended to be 120, considering only the constant term in \\(c\\). I'm a bit confused here. Let me try to think differently.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, in other words, when you expand the product, you'll have terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), and the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the sum of the coefficients of all such terms. So, that would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients of \\(c^k\\) for all \\(k\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384. Therefore, the coefficient is 384.\n\nWait, but in the example I did earlier, with \\((a + b)^1 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^1\\), the coefficient of \\(a\\) is \\(c + 1/c\\), which is a polynomial. So, in that case, the coefficient isn't a single number. Therefore, perhaps in the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed a polynomial in \\(c\\), and the problem is expecting that, but since it's written as a numerical coefficient, perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is miswritten, and it's actually \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), and it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^3\\), for example. But without more context, it's hard to say. Given the problem as stated, I think the most reasonable interpretation is that it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. Therefore, I'll go with 120 as the answer.\n\nWait, but to be thorough, let me consider both interpretations:\n\n1. If the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, then the answer is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\n2. If the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then the answer is 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nGiven that the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, I think the second interpretation is more likely intended, so the answer is 120.\n\nWait, but let me think again. If I expand \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for various \\(k\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the sum of all coefficients from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each multiplied by 6. So, that would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384. Therefore, the coefficient is 384.\n\nWait, but in that case, the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), not a single number. So, perhaps the problem is indeed expecting a numerical coefficient, implying that it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. Therefore, I think that's the correct answer.\n\nWait, to resolve this, perhaps I should compute the product step by step. Let me compute \\((a + b)^4\\) first:\n\n\\((a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\).\n\nNow, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) can be expanded using the binomial theorem:\n\n\\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\times (1/c)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\).\n\nSo, the expansion is:\n\n\\(c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15/c^2 + 6/c^4 + 1/c^6\\).\n\nNow, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product will be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). The sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\(1^6 + 6 \\times 1^4 + 15 \\times 1^2 + 20 + 15 \\times 1^{-2} + 6 \\times 1^{-4} + 1 \\times 1^{-6} = 1 + 6 + 15 + 20 + 15 + 6 + 1 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but in this case, the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), because each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is multiplied by 6. So, the coefficient would be 6 times \\(\\left(c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15/c^2 + 6/c^4 + 1/c^6\\right)\\), which is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, so perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when \\(c\\) is set to 1, which would make the coefficient 6 * 64 = 384. But that seems a bit forced.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting me to treat \\(c\\) as another variable and find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), meaning the coefficient is a polynomial. But since the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, perhaps it's expecting me to recognize that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but in the expansion, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is indeed 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial. Therefore, the coefficient is a polynomial, not a single number. Therefore, perhaps the problem is expecting me to recognize that and provide the polynomial. But the problem says \"the coefficient\", implying a numerical value, so maybe it's a misinterpretation. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120, as I thought earlier.\n\nWait, let me check the problem statement again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" It doesn't specify anything about \\(c\\), so perhaps it's indeed asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384. Therefore, the coefficient is 384.\n\nBut wait, in that case, the coefficient is a polynomial, which seems odd. So, perhaps the problem is expecting me to recognize that the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), but since it's asking for a numerical coefficient, maybe it's intended to be 120. I'm a bit stuck here.\n\nWait, perhaps I can think of it this way: when you have two polynomials multiplied together, the coefficient of a specific term in one polynomial is the product of that term's coefficient and the sum of all coefficients in the other polynomial. So, in this case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 * 64 = 384. So, that's the answer.\n\nWait, but in the example I did earlier, with \\((a + b)^1 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^1\\), the coefficient of \\(a\\) is \\(c + 1/c\\), which is a polynomial. So, in that case, the coefficient isn't a single number. Therefore, in the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial. But the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, so perhaps it's intended to be 120, considering only the constant term in \\(c\\). Therefore, I think the answer is 120.\n\nWait, but to be absolutely sure, let me compute the product explicitly. Let me write out the terms:\n\nFrom \\((a + b)^4\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6\\(a^2b^2\\).\n\nFrom \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the expansion is \\(c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15/c^2 + 6/c^4 + 1/c^6\\).\n\nWhen I multiply 6\\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the expansion, I get:\n\n6\\(a^2b^2c^6 + 6 \\times 6 a^2b^2c^4 + 6 \\times 15 a^2b^2c^2 + 6 \\times 20 a^2b^2 + 6 \\times 15 a^2b^2/c^2 + 6 \\times 6 a^2b^2/c^4 + 6 \\times 1 a^2b^2/c^6\\).\n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nTherefore, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), the answer is 120.\n\nBut if it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then the coefficient is a polynomial, which is 6 times the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6\\(c^6 + 36c^4 + 90c^2 + 120 + 90/c^2 + 36/c^4 + 6/c^6\\).\n\nBut since the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, I think it's more likely that it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nTherefore, after all this thinking, I conclude that the coefficient is 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break down the problem into two parts using the binomial theorem.\n\n1. **Expanding \\((a + b)^4\\):**\n   Using the binomial theorem, we know that:\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\), so the coefficient is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\n   \\]\n\n2. **Expanding \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   Using the binomial theorem, we know that:\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n   \\]\n   We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, which occurs when \\(6 - 2k = 0\\).

The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from \\((a + b)^4\\), and when we multiply it by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, is that right? Because when you multiply by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is being multiplied by every term in that expansion. But since we're only interested in \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), we need to find how many ways we can get \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by 1 (i.e., the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, because only then \\(c^0 = 1\\), and that term would contribute to the constant term in \\(c\\), which would then multiply \\(a^2b^2\\)). So, perhaps the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).

Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20.

Because if we multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by any term involving \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), then the resulting term would have \\(c\\) in it, which isn't part of \\(a^2b^2\\).

The term \\(a^2b^2\\) is in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\), and when we multiply it by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that can't be right because that would mean the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion, which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a specific coefficient, not an expression. Hmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Let me clarify: when we multiply two polynomials, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial, and the coefficients are multiplied as well. So, if I have \\( (a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 \\), and I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), then perhaps the coefficient will be the coefficient from \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the sum of all coefficients in the second part? Wait, no, because the second part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which expands to terms involving various powers of \\(c\\). But since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term without \\(c\\), that would mean that the \\(c\\) terms in the second expansion must cancel out, i.e., the exponent of \\(c\\) must be zero. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by \\(c^0\\), you get \\(a^2b^2\\), which is the term we're interested in. So, I think that's the right approach. So, first, find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which we already found to be 6. Then, find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Once we have both coefficients, multiply them together to get the final coefficient in the product. So, let's work on finding the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Again, we can use the binomial theorem here. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k\\). Simplifying each term, that's \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} c^{-k} = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We want the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so we set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\) so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Now, going back to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is the product of the two coefficients we found: 6 (from \\(a^2b^2\\)) and 20 (from \\(c^0\\)). So, 6 multiplied by 20 is 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120. Wait, let me double-check that. So, the first part: \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6, since \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). The second part: \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, when you multiply these two, 6 * 20 = 120. That seems correct.

But wait, \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't have any \\(c\\) terms, so the only way for that to happen is if the term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is a constant term, i.e., the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. Because if the term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) has a non-zero exponent of \\(c\\), then when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), it would result in a term that includes \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), which we don't want. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I need to find two things: 1. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which I already found to be 6. 2. The constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me work on that second part. The expression \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) can be expanded using the binomial theorem as well. So, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying each term, that becomes \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m} = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We're looking for the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, so we set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is when \\(m = 3\\), and the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20. Now, going back to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) and the constant term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, that's 6 multiplied by 20, which equals 120. Wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake here. So, \\((a + b)^4\\) gives 6 for \\(a^2b^2\\), and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) has a constant term of 20, so multiplying them gives 6 * 20 = 120. That seems right. Let me double-check the binomial coefficients. For \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). For \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term where \\(m = 3\\) gives the constant term, and \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\), so that's correct. So, the final coefficient should be 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplying it by the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20. Therefore, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\boxed{120}"

    "text": " Wait, no, that might not be correct. Let me think again. Actually, when you multiply two expressions together, each term in the first expression is multiplied by each term in the second expression. So, if I have \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), then the expansion would be the product of the two expansions. But since I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I can consider that term in the first part and then multiply it by the entire expansion of the second part, because any term from the second expansion will just be multiplied by the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. Wait, but that doesn't make sense because the second part is a separate variable. Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Let me clarify: The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product. But \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\) at all. So, actually, when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will just be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since the question is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term without \\(c\\), that means we need to find the sum of all the coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) that result in a constant term (i.e., \\(c^0\\)), because when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), that term would still be \\(a^2b^2\\) times 1. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of the coefficients of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, that might not be the right approach. Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that each term in the product will be a combination of terms from both expansions. So, to get \\(a^2b^2\\), I need to pick \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part, and then any term from the second part that doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\). But since the second part is only in terms of \\(c\\), which is a different variable, I think that the product of \\(a^2b^2\\) with any term from the second expansion will just be \\(a^2b^2\\) times that term. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), it would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients in the second part. Wait, no, that's not correct either because the second part is a separate expression. Let me try another approach. Maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, in other words, when you multiply the two expressions, each term will have some combination of \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\), and \\(1/c\\). But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) appears, regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), it would actually be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times the sum of all the coefficients in the second expansion. Wait, no, that's not correct because the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion would give the value when \\(c = 1\\), but I don't think that's what we need here. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, but since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient would just be the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. But that doesn't make sense because the coefficient should be a number, not an expression in \\(c\\). Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me read the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, in the entire product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) can be multiplied by any term from the second expansion, but since \\(a^2b^2\\) is independent of \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Because each term in the second part, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), would contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. So, the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but the sum of the coefficients in a polynomial is found by setting all variables to 1. So, if I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = (2)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the sum of the coefficients in the second part is 64. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 * 64 = 384. Wait, but that seems high. Let me check if that's correct. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without considering the \\(c\\) terms, meaning that we treat the entire second expression as a single term, but that doesn't make sense because it's an expansion. Alternatively, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\). In that case, we need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part, then multiply them together. So, in that case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is the middle term when expanded. Let me calculate that. Using the binomial theorem, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\). So, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire product is 6 * 20 = 120. But wait, the problem didn't specify \\(c^0\\); it just asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, does that mean we're considering all possible powers of \\(c\\), or only the constant term? Hmm, that's a bit ambiguous. But in algebra, when you're asked for the coefficient of a specific term without any other variables, it usually means considering all possible combinations. But in this case, since \\(a^2b^2\\) is independent of \\(c\\), the coefficient would actually be the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by the coefficient from the first part. Because each term in the second expansion would multiply \\(a^2b^2\\), resulting in \\(a^2b^2\\) times each term in the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of the coefficients in the second part. As I calculated earlier, the sum of the coefficients in the second part is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. But wait, that seems like a lot. Let me think again. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to consider the product as a whole, and the term \\(a^2b^2\\) can be combined with any term from the second expansion, regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would indeed be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. But I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, maybe the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without considering the \\(c\\) terms, meaning that we treat the second part as 1, but that doesn't make sense because the second part is part of the product. Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part, but that would make the coefficient a polynomial in \\(c\\), which isn't what is being asked. The problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, so I think the correct interpretation is that we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), i.e., the constant term with respect to \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient would be 6 * 20 = 120. Let me verify this. If I expand \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. Then, in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. So, when I multiply these two expansions, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is independent of \\(c\\), we need to consider only the term in the second expansion that is \\(c^0\\), because any other power of \\(c\\) would make the term have \\(c\\) in it, which would not be \\(a^2b^2\\) alone. Therefore, the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120. So, I think that's the correct answer. Wait, but earlier I thought the sum of coefficients in the second part is 64, which would give 6 * 64 = 384, but that would be if we're considering all terms in the product, but the problem is specifically asking for \\(a^2b^2\\), which is independent of \\(c\\), so we need to find the coefficient where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\). Therefore, the correct approach is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part, which is 20, and multiply them together to get 120. So, the final answer should be 120.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break down the problem as follows:\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\), so its coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n\n2. **Find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n   \\]\n   The constant term (\\(c^0\\)) occurs when \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\).

But actually, the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, perhaps the answer is just 6 times the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, no, that's not quite right. Let me think again. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when you expand this, each term will be of the form \\(a^{4 - k}b^k \\times c^m\\) or \\(a^{4 - k}b^k \\times c^{-m}\\) for various \\(k\\) and \\(m\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), that term would be \\(6 \\times\\) the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, that might be the case. Because for each \\(c\\) term, when you multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), it just scales it by that coefficient. So, the total coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) across all powers of \\(c\\) would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\). Because when \\(c = 1\\), \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of the coefficients is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times 64, which is 384. Wait, but that seems too high. Let me check again. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and since \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is being multiplied, but \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient would just be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the coefficient from the term where \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because only the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero would contribute to the constant term, which would then multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms. So, perhaps I should find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) and then multiply it by 6. Let me try that approach. So, first, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, as before. Now, in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the expansion is given by the binomial theorem as \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the exponent of \\(c\\) in each term is \\(6 - 2m\\). We need to find the term where the exponent is zero, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Wait, that makes more sense because 120 is a reasonable number, whereas 384 seemed too large. So, maybe my initial approach was wrong because I thought the sum of all coefficients is 64, but that's not necessary here. Instead, since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is independent of \\(c\\), we only need the term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) that has \\(c^0\\), which is 20, and then multiply that by 6, giving 120.

But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), that would mean we need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because \\(c^0 = 1\\), so that term won't affect the \\(a^2b^2\\) term.

Again, using the binomial theorem: \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be 0, so we set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\).

    "text": " Wait, no, that might not be correct because when you multiply two expressions together, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression. But since we're only looking for the term \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), that means we need to take the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) and multiply it by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient from the \\(c\\) part would just be 1, right? Wait, no, that doesn't seem right. Let me think again. Actually, when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term from the first expansion is multiplied by each term from the second expansion. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't have any \\(c\\) terms, that means we need to find the term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) that is a constant, i.e., the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. Because only then, when we multiply it by \\(a^2b^2\\), we'll get a term that's just \\(a^2b^2\\) times that constant. So, first, let me find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). To do that, I can use the binomial theorem again. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying that, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m} = \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We want the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, so we set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Now, going back to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part is 20. So, when we multiply these two parts together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Let me double-check that. So, from \\((a + b)^4\\), \\(a^2b^2\\) has a coefficient of 6. From \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the constant term is 20. Multiplying them together gives 120. That seems correct. I don't think I made any mistakes in the calculations. So, the coefficient is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Multiplying these gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\boxed{120}"

    "text": " Wait, no, that doesn't make sense because the \\(c\\) terms could affect the overall coefficient when multiplied by the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, if I expand both parts separately, each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since the problem only asks for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I just need to find the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) appears, which is from \\((a + b)^4\\), and then multiply it by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, no, because when you multiply two polynomials, each term from the first polynomial is multiplied by each term from the second. So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't make sense because the coefficient should be a number, not a polynomial. Wait, no, actually, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term is in the first part, and the second part is multiplied by it. So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be the coefficient from the first part times the entire second part. But that can't be right because then it would be a polynomial in \\(c\\), but the problem is just asking for a coefficient, which suggests it's a constant. Hmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Wait, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\), which is 1. So, that would involve both parts: from \\((a + b)^4\\), we have the coefficient 6 for \\(a^2b^2\\), and from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we need the term where \\(c^0\\) is present. Then, the overall coefficient would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Okay, that makes more sense. So, first, let's find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Again, using the binomial theorem, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be 0, so we set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which gives \\(m = 3\\). So, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Now, the overall coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficients from each part. So, 6 (from \\(a^2b^2\\)) times 20 (from \\(c^0\\)) equals 120. Therefore, the coefficient is 120. Wait, let me double-check that. So, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. In \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Multiplying these together gives 6 * 20 = 120. That seems correct. Alternatively, I can think of it as the product of two independent binomial expansions, and since \\(a^2b^2\\) is only affected by the first part, and the second part contributes a factor that is multiplied by it, so the coefficient would indeed be 6 * 20 = 120.
