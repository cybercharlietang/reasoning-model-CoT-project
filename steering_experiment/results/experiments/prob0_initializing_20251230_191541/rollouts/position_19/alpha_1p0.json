    "text": " Wait, no, actually, since we're looking for the term \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), maybe the coefficient is just the product of the coefficients from each part. Hmm, but wait, I think I might be overcomplicating it. Let me think again. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When you multiply two expressions together, the coefficients of the terms multiply as well. But since we're only interested in the term \\(a^2b^2\\), which is in the first part, and the second part doesn't have any \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), so when we multiply, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part will be multiplied by every term in the second part. But wait, no, that's not quite right. Because we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is independent of \\(c\\), so actually, the coefficient in the product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. But since the second part doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will just be the coefficient from the first part times the entire expansion of the second part. Wait, no, that doesn't make sense because the second part is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which expands into terms involving \\(c\\) raised to different powers, but when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), each term would have \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for various \\(k\\). But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, actually, in the product, \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by the sum of all the terms in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), because each term in the second expansion is a coefficient times \\(c^k\\), and when you multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), you just get \\(a^2b^2\\) times the sum of those coefficients. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients in the second part. So, first, let's find the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). The sum of coefficients in a polynomial is found by setting all variables to 1. So, if I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(1 + 1/1\\right)^6 = (2)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the sum of all coefficients in the second part is 64. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 64 (sum of coefficients in the second part). So, 6 * 64 = 384. Therefore, the coefficient is 384. Wait, but let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. So, if I have \\((a + b)^4\\) times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), then the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the first part, and when multiplied by each term in the second part, it's just \\(a^2b^2\\) times each term in the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would indeed be the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all coefficients in the second part because each term in the second part is a coefficient times some power of \\(c\\), and when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), it's just \\(a^2b^2\\) times the sum of those coefficients. So, that makes sense. So, the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 64, and the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, so 6 * 64 = 384. Therefore, the coefficient is 384. Alternatively, I could think of it as the entire expression being the product of two polynomials, and when you multiply, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the product of the coefficients from each part, since the variables are independent. So, yeah, I think that's correct. So, I'm pretty confident the answer is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is found by considering the binomial expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) and the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\)**:\n   - Using the binomial theorem, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\).\n   - The coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n\n2. **Sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)**:\n   - Set \\(c = 1\\) to find the sum of coefficients: \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\).\n\n3. **Multiply the coefficients**:\n   - The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\(\\boxed{384}\\)."

So, when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficients multiply as well. But in this case, the first part is \\((a + b)^4\\) and the second part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), the multiplication will involve terms from both expansions. However, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part will be multiplied by every term in the second part. But since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. Wait, but that doesn't seem right because the second part is also an expression with variables. Wait, no, maybe I'm misinterpreting the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, perhaps when they say \"coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", they're treating \\(c\\) as another variable, but \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), so the coefficient would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that doesn't make sense because the coefficient should be a number, not a polynomial. Hmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, treating all variables together. But \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), so the coefficient would just be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which seems odd because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where \\(c\\) is raised to the zero power. Because if we're looking for \\(a^2b^2\\), we might also need to consider the terms in \\(c\\) such that the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out, leaving a term without \\(c\\). So, perhaps the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). That makes more sense because otherwise, the coefficient would involve \\(c\\) terms, which isn't a numerical coefficient. So, I think that's the right approach. Therefore, I need to compute two things:\n\n1. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which we already found to be 6.\n\n2. The coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\).\n\nThen, multiply these two coefficients together to get the final coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression.\n\nAlright, so let's tackle the second part: finding the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Again, this is another binomial expansion. Using the binomial theorem, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(1/c\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\).\n\nWe need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so we set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\).\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\).\n\nCalculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\).\n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20.\n\nNow, going back to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the product of the coefficients we found: 6 (from \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\)) multiplied by 20 (from \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\)).\n\nSo, 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 120.\n\nWait, let me just double-check to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. So, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6 because \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Then, in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term where \\(c^0\\) is when \\(k = 3\\), and \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying 6 and 20 gives 120, which seems correct.\n\nI don't think I missed anything here. The key was realizing that since we're looking for a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), we need to find the \\(c^0\\) term in the second expansion and then multiply it by the coefficient from the first expansion. That makes sense because when you multiply the two expansions together, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part will be multiplied by every term in the second part, but only the term with \\(c^0\\) will result in a term that doesn't have any \\(c\\) in it. So, the coefficient is just the product of the two coefficients. Yeah, I think that's solid.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is found using the binomial theorem: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). For \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying these gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\boxed{120}"

    "text": " Wait, no, that doesn't seem right. Wait, actually, since we're looking for a term that's only in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the other part is in \\(c\\), maybe the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would just be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but since we're only considering the term \\(a^2b^2\\), the \\(c\\) part doesn't affect it, so maybe the coefficient is just 6 times whatever the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is? Wait, no, that can't be right because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would just be the product of the coefficients from each part since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\). So, perhaps the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just 6, and the rest of the terms involving \\(c\\) don't affect it because \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\). Wait, that seems too simple. Let me think again. The problem is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when we expand this, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since we're only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term without \\(c\\), the only way that can happen is if we take the term from \\((a + b)^4\\) that is \\(a^2b^2\\) and multiply it by the term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) that is \\(c^0\\), which is 1. Because any other term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) would have a power of \\(c\\) that isn't zero, and thus when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), it would result in a term that includes \\(c\\) to some power, which isn't part of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, that means the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I already found that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. Now, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me figure that out. Again, using the binomial theorem, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k\\). Simplifying the exponents, that's \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} c^{-k} = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, each term has an exponent of \\(6 - 2k\\). We want the term where the exponent is 0, so we set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 (from the \\(a + b\\) part) times 20 (from the \\(c + 1/c\\) part), which is 6 * 20 = 120. So, the coefficient is 120.\n\nWait, but let me double-check that. So, \\((a + b)^4\\) gives \\(a^2b^2\\) with coefficient 6. \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) gives \\(c^0\\) with coefficient 20. So, when you multiply the two expressions, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in the \\(c\\) expansion, but only the \\(c^0\\) term will result in a term without \\(c\\), which is what we're interested in. So, the coefficient is indeed 6 * 20 = 120. So, the final answer should be 120. I think that's correct.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by considering each part separately. \n\n1. **Expanding \\((a + b)^4\\)**:\n   - Using the binomial theorem, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) has the coefficient \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n\n2. **Expanding \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)**:\n   - The term with \\(c^0\\) is found when the exponent \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), giving \\(k = 3\\).\n   - The coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n\n3. **Combining the coefficients**:\n   - Multiply the coefficients from each part: \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), I think that means we only need to consider the term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) that is a constant term, because when we multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by that constant term, it will still be \\(a^2b^2\\) times that constant, so the coefficient would be 6 times that constant. Wait, is that right? Let me think again. So, if I have \\((a + b)^4\\) times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), and I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term without \\(c\\). So, when I multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) (which comes from the first part) by a term from the second expansion, the term from the second expansion must be a constant term, i.e., a term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, because otherwise, the resulting term would have a \\(c\\) component, which we don't want. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part. Therefore, I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Let me figure that out. So, let's expand \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem. That would be \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(1/c\\right)^m\\). Simplifying each term, that becomes \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m} = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, so we set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). So, the constant term is when \\(m = 3\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} c^{0}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the constant term from the second part, which is 20. So, 6 times 20 is 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120. Wait, let me make sure I didn't miss anything. So, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\). So, when we multiply the two expansions, only the constant term in the second expansion will contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) because any other term would introduce a \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\) term, which would make the overall term have a \\(c\\) component, which isn't part of \\(a^2b^2\\).

So, maybe the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, that doesn't make sense because the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is a sum of terms involving different powers of \\(c\\), but we're only looking for a term that has \\(a^2b^2\\) and nothing else. So, perhaps the \\(c\\) terms don't affect the \\(a^2b^2\\) term because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by any term from the second expansion, it just adds a coefficient, but since we're only interested in the \\(a^2b^2\\) term, maybe the coefficient is just the product of the coefficients from each part. Wait, no, that might not be correct. Let me think again. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when you expand this, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).

But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), that means we have to consider all the terms in the second expansion and sum their coefficients, because each term in the second expansion will multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term, effectively adding their coefficients to the total coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, but that seems off because if we have \\((a + b)^4\\) times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), then the entire expression is a product, and \\(a^2b^2\\) is just a term in the first part, so when multiplied by the second part, each term in the second part adds a coefficient to \\(a^2b^2\\). But actually, no, because \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term in the first expansion, and when you multiply by the second expansion, which is in terms of \\(c\\), you don't get any cross terms between \\(a\\) and \\(c\\). So, in other words, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, each of which is a power of \\(c\\). Therefore, in the product, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will be multiplied by each of those \\(c\\) terms, but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), that would mean that the coefficient is actually the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients in the second part. Wait, but that doesn't sound right because each term in the second expansion is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient from the first part times the entire second expansion. But that would mean the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion, which is a polynomial in \\(c\\), but we're only looking for a scalar coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\). Hmm, I'm getting confused here. Maybe I should approach this differently. Let me think: when you have two independent variables, \\(a, b\\) and \\(c\\), the terms in the product are independent. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is a sum of terms involving \\(c^6\\), \\(c^4\\), etc., down to \\(c^{-6}\\), each multiplied by their respective coefficients. So, when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each of these terms, you get terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), etc. But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, in other words, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that's not quite right because each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually be the coefficient from the first part times the sum of the coefficients from the second part. But is that correct? Let me think. The sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) would be obtained by setting \\(c = 1\\), because substituting \\(c = 1\\) gives the sum of the coefficients. So, if I substitute \\(c = 1\\) into \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), I get \\((1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, times 64, giving 6 * 64 = 384. Wait, but that seems too straightforward. Let me check if that's correct. Alternatively, maybe I should consider that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is just the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), perhaps it's just 6 times the sum of the coefficients of the second expansion, which is 64, so 6*64=384. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me try to think differently. Let's consider that the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When you expand this, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because each term in the second expansion contributes its coefficient when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). So, yes, that would mean the coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, maybe I should look at it as the entire product, and the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just 6 times the expansion of the second part, but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, it's 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. Since the sum of coefficients in the second expansion is 64, as we found earlier, the total coefficient would be 6 * 64 = 384. So, I think that's the answer. Let me just verify that approach. So, to recap: The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is obtained by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 * 64 = 384. That seems correct. So, I think the final answer is 384.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break it down as follows:\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term with \\(a^2b^2\\) occurs when \\(k = 2\\):\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\n   \\]\n   So, the coefficient from this part is 6.\n\n2. **Consider the second part \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   The sum of the coefficients in this expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\):\n   \\[\n   \\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\n   \\]\n\n3. **Multiply the coefficients:**\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the product of the coefficients from each part:\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 64 = 384\n   \\]\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{384}\\)."

    "text": " Wait, no, that might not be the right approach. Let me think again. Actually, the entire expression is the product of two expansions: \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When we multiply two polynomials, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), maybe the terms involving \\(c\\) will just contribute a factor that's part of the coefficient. Hmm, that makes sense. So, perhaps the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, that doesn't seem right because when you multiply, each term from \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). However, since we're only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), the \\(c\\) terms will just contribute a factor that's part of the coefficient. So, in other words, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) will be the same as the coefficient in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the part involving \\(c\\) will just multiply the coefficient. Wait, that might not be accurate. Let me think differently. Maybe I need to consider that when you multiply the two expansions together, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first expansion will be multiplied by every term in the second expansion. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), that means we can just take the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and multiply it by the entire second expansion. But wait, that doesn't make sense because the second expansion has terms with \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), which are variables. So, actually, maybe the entire expression will have terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2 \\cdot c^{-k}\\), but the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would require that the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, right? Because \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term without \\(c\\). So, that means we need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by \\(c^0\\), you get \\(a^2b^2\\), which is the term we're interested in. So, that makes more sense. So, first, we found that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. Now, we need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Once we have that, we can multiply it by 6 to get the final coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression. So, how do we find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)? Again, we can use the binomial theorem. Let me write it out: \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying that, each term becomes \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\cdot c^{-m} = \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the exponent of \\(c\\) in each term is \\(6 - 2m\\). We need the exponent to be 0, so we set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Now, going back to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the two coefficients we found: 6 and 20. So, 6 multiplied by 20 is 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120. Let me just double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake. First, I expanded \\((a + b)^4\\) and found the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) correctly as 6. Then, for \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), I used the binomial theorem and found that the term with \\(c^0\\) occurs when \\(m = 3\\), which gives a coefficient of 20. Multiplying these together gives 120. That seems correct. So, I think the final answer is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is found by first determining the coefficient in \\((a + b)^4\\) and then multiplying it by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\n1. Coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\): \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n2. Coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n3.

But since we're only looking for a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), maybe the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), must contribute a term that's just a constant, right? Because \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term without \\(c\\), so when we multiply by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we need to find the constant term in that expansion, because any other term would introduce a \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\) factor, which would make the product have \\(c\\) in it, but we don't want that. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, let me break this down into two parts: 1. Find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\). We already did that, it's 6. 2. Find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Then, multiply those two together. So, let me focus on the second part. To find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), I can again use the binomial theorem. The expansion is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k\\). Simplifying each term: \\(c^{6 - k} \\times c^{-k} = c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero because that's the constant term. So, set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\): \\(6 - 2k = 0\\) \u21d2 \\(2k = 6\\) \u21d2 \\(k = 3\\). So, the constant term is when \\(k = 3\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the constant term in the second part). So, 6 \u00d7 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient is 120. Wait, but let me double-check to make sure I didn't make a mistake. So, the first part: \\((a + b)^4\\) has \\(a^2b^2\\) with coefficient 6. The second part: \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) has a constant term when the exponent is zero, which occurs at \\(k = 3\\), giving 20. Multiplying 6 and 20 gives 120. Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe I can think of it differently: when you multiply the two expressions together, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) gets multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But since we're only interested in the terms where the product doesn't have \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), that means we need the constant term from the second expression. So, yes, that approach also leads to 120. So, I think that's the correct answer. But just to be thorough, let me consider if there's any other way this could be approached. Maybe using multinomial coefficients or something else? Wait, no, I think the approach I took is correct. So, the coefficient is 120. Therefore, the final answer is 120.\n\nWait, but hold on a second. The problem is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, when we multiply these two, the terms are indeed multiplied. So, each term from the first expansion is multiplied by each term from the second. But since we're only interested in the terms where the product has \\(a^2b^2\\), which comes from the first expansion, and the second expansion contributes a constant term, so the coefficient is the product of the two coefficients, which is 6 \u00d7 20 = 120.

However, since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) part, perhaps the coefficient is the product of the coefficients from each part. Wait, no, that can't be right because the second part is a separate expression. Let me try another approach. Maybe I can consider that \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is being multiplied by \\((a + b)^4\\), so when I expand the entire expression, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).

But that seems a bit confusing because the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) has multiple terms with different powers of \\(c\\). Wait, but perhaps the question is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, in that case, the coefficient would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But how do I find the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)? Well, the sum of the coefficients in a polynomial is found by setting all variables to 1. So, if I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = (2)^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 (from \\((a + b)^4\\)) multiplied by 64 (sum of coefficients from the other part), which would be 6 * 64 = 384. But wait, that seems a bit off because the problem is presented as if it's a single term, but maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Alternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, which would include all possible terms from the multiplication. But actually, no, because the other part is in terms of \\(c\\), so when you multiply, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term would be multiplied by each term in the \\(c\\) expansion, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the \\(c\\) expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. But I'm not sure if that's the right approach. Alternatively, maybe the problem is intended to have the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, so perhaps the answer is simply 6, but that doesn't seem right because the other part is also being multiplied. Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)\". So, the entire expression is the product of two binomial expansions. So, when we multiply them, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second part. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be 6 (the coefficient from the first part) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which is 64, as calculated before. So, 6 * 64 = 384. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 384. But wait, let me check that again. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to have the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), meaning that we're looking for the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, because \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\). So, in that case, we would need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product. So, that would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). That makes more sense, perhaps. So, let me recast the problem: we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product. So, first, from \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, as before. Now, from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we need the coefficient of \\(c^0\\). So, let's find that. Using the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We want the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which implies \\(k = 3\\). So, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. So, putting it all together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product is 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120. Wait, but earlier I thought it was 384, but that was when considering all coefficients, but perhaps the problem is asking for the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\), which makes more sense because otherwise, the coefficient would be a sum over all \\(c\\) terms, which might not be intended. So, perhaps the correct approach is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be 6 * 20 = 120. Let me verify that. So, \\((a + b)^4\\) gives us \\(a^2b^2\\) with coefficient 6. \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) gives us \\(c^0\\) with coefficient 20. Multiplying these two, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by \\(c^0\\), so the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 120. I think that makes sense because if we're looking for the term that has exactly \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, we need to ensure that the \\(c\\) part is also at its zero exponent. So, the answer should be 120. Wait, but let me check again. Alternatively, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, meaning that it's multiplied by any combination of \\(c\\) terms. But in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 64, leading to 384. But I think the more likely scenario is that the problem wants the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. Let me see if that's the case. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is written as \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), and we're to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which would mean that we're looking for the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present, regardless of what's happening with \\(c\\). But in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which would mean the coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384. But that seems a bit strange because the coefficient of a term in a product is usually considered in the context of specific exponents for all variables. So, perhaps the correct interpretation is that we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be 120. To confirm, let's consider that when you multiply two expressions, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expression comes with a coefficient of 6, and in the second expression, we have terms like \\(c^6\\), \\(6c^4\\), \\(15c^2\\), \\(20c^0\\), \\(15c^{-2}\\), \\(6c^{-4}\\), and \\(c^{-6}\\). So, when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each of these, the resulting terms would be \\(6c^6a^2b^2\\), \\(36c^4a^2b^2\\), \\(90c^2a^2b^2\\), \\(120a^2b^2\\), \\(90c^{-2}a^2b^2\\), \\(36c^{-4}a^2b^2\\), and \\(6c^{-6}a^2b^2\\). So, in the entire product, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) (without any \\(c\\) terms) is 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120. So, I think that's the correct answer. Therefore, the coefficient is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Next, we find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which occurs when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. This happens when \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), so \\(k = 3\\), giving the coefficient \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying these coefficients together, \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\boxed{120}"

    "text": " Wait, no, actually, the entire expression is a product of two parts. So, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term from the second expansion. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), that means we just need the coefficient from the first part, and the second part can be evaluated separately, but since it's multiplied by the first part, maybe the second part contributes a factor that just scales the entire expression. Wait, no, because \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't have any \\(c\\) terms, so perhaps the coefficient is just the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't make sense because then the coefficient would be multiplied by some expression involving \\(c\\), but we're just looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term without \\(c\\). Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, if I expand both parts separately and then multiply them together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will come from the product of the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first part and the constant term (i.e., the term with \\(c^0\\)) in the second part. Because any other term in the second expansion would have a power of \\(c\\), which would make the product have terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some \\(k\\), but we only want \\(a^2b^2\\), which has no \\(c\\) terms. So, I think the approach is: 1. Find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which we already found to be 6. 2. Find the constant term (i.e., the term with \\(c^0\\)) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). 3. Multiply these two results together to get the final coefficient. Okay, so let's do step 2. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) can also be handled using the binomial theorem. So, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying that, each term becomes \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\times c^{-m} = \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Let me compute that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20. Now, going back to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the product of the coefficients from both expansions. So, that would be 6 (from \\((a + b)^4\\)) times 20 (from the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)). So, 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120. Wait, but let me just double-check that I didn't miss anything. So, the first part: \\((a + b)^4\\) gives 6 for \\(a^2b^2\\). The second part: \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) gives 20 as the constant term. Multiplying 6 and 20 gives 120. That seems correct. Alternatively, maybe I can think of the entire expression as the product of two independent expansions, so when you multiply them, the coefficients multiply as well. So, yeah, that should be right. I don't think I made any mistakes here. So, the final answer should be 120.\n\nWait, but hold on, let me make sure I didn't misinterpret the problem. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product of \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, when I multiply these two expressions together, each term from \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by every term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), that means we need to consider the product of \\(a^2b^2\\) (which is a term without \\(c\\)) and the term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) that is also without \\(c\\), which is the constant term. So, the coefficient would indeed be 6 * 20 = 120. Alternatively, if I didn't think about it that way, I might have considered that the entire expression is a product, and so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just the product of the coefficients from each part, provided that the other part doesn't contribute any \\(c\\) terms. Since we're only looking for \\(a^2b^2\\), any \\(c\\) terms would create terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), which we don't want. Therefore, only the constant term in the second part contributes to the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. So, yes, 120 is correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of it as the product of two independent variables, so the coefficients multiply. So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, and the coefficient for \\(c^0\\) in the second part is 20, so the combined coefficient is 6*20=120. That makes sense.\n\nWait, another way to think about it: when you have two separate polynomials multiplied together, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each polynomial. So, in this case, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial has coefficient 6, and the term \\(c^0\\) in the second polynomial has coefficient 20. So, when you multiply these two terms together, you get \\(6*20 = 120\\) as the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is just \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the answer is 120.\n\nWait, but just to make sure I didn't make a mistake in calculating the binomial coefficients. Let me recalculate them. For \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\), which is indeed 6. And for \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the constant term is when the exponent is 0, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), so \\(m=3\\), and \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\) is 20. So, 6*20=120. Yeah, that seems correct.\n\nI think that's all. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break down the problem into two parts:\n\n1. **Expanding \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   We need the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2, which corresponds to \\(k = 2\\). The coefficient for this term is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\n   \\]\n\n2. **Expanding \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n   \\]\n   We need the constant term (where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0), which occurs when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\).

So, when I expand both, the terms will multiply each other. But the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), and the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), will contribute some multiple that we might need to consider. Wait, but actually, since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will just be the product of the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from \\((a + b)^4\\) and the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems a bit confusing. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are different variables, the only way to get a term with \\(a^2b^2\\) is to take the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from \\((a + b)^4\\) and multiply it by any term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, that would mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because \\(a^2b^2\\) can be multiplied by any term from the second expression. But is that correct? Let me think. No, actually, that's not quite right. Because when you multiply two polynomials, each term from the first polynomial is multiplied by each term from the second polynomial. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Because each term in the second part, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), will contribute to the overall coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. So, if I denote the first part as \\(P = (a + b)^4\\) and the second part as \\(Q = \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), then the product \\(P \\times Q\\) will have terms like \\(a^2b^2 \\times c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2 \\times c^4\\), etc., each multiplied by their respective coefficients. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\), we can think of it as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(P\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(Q\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(P\\) is 6, as we found earlier. Now, we need to find the sum of all coefficients in \\(Q\\). The sum of all coefficients in a polynomial is found by evaluating the polynomial at \\(c = 1\\), because substituting 1 for all variables gives the sum of coefficients. So, let's compute \\(Q(1) = \\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = (1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the sum of all coefficients in \\(Q\\) is 64. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product \\(P \\times Q\\) is 6 (from \\(P\\)) multiplied by 64 (from \\(Q\\)), which is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). Wait, but let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. Because when you multiply \\(P\\) and \\(Q\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from \\(P\\) will be multiplied by every term in \\(Q\\), so the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will indeed be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(P\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(Q\\). That makes sense because each term in \\(Q\\) contributes a coefficient that gets multiplied by the 6 from \\(a^2b^2\\), and since we're summing over all possible \\(c\\) terms, each multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), the total coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\) is 6 times 64. So, 6 * 64 is 384. So, the coefficient is 384.\n\nWait, but let me double-check if that's correct. Alternatively, maybe I should consider that the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term is a product of a term from \\((a + b)^4\\) and a term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term from the second part, which will have different powers of \\(c\\). But since the problem doesn't specify any particular power of \\(c\\), just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\), the coefficient would indeed be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part. So, 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should think of it as the coefficient being 6 times the sum of the coefficients of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Since each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is of the form \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - k} \\times \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, the sum of all coefficients is when we set \\(c = 1\\), which gives 2^6 = 64, as I did earlier. So, that part is correct.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 * 64 = 384. So, I think that's the answer.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, maybe I should approach it differently. Let me consider expanding both expressions separately and then see how the terms multiply.\n\nFirst, \\((a + b)^4\\) expanded is:\n\n\\[\na^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\n\\]\n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6.\n\nNow, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) can be expanded using the binomial theorem as:\n\n\\[\n\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n\\]\n\nSo, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\\) for \\(k = 0\\) to \\(6\\). The sum of all coefficients is when \\(c = 1\\), which is 64, as before.\n\nSo, when we multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) with coefficient 6 in the first polynomial will be multiplied by each term in the second polynomial, each with their own coefficients. Therefore, the total coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) times any power of \\(c\\) will be 6 multiplied by the sum of the coefficients of the second polynomial, which is 64. So, 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but another way to think about it is that when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum of the products of coefficients from each polynomial whose exponents add up to that term. But in this case, since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), we're effectively looking for all combinations where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2 each, and the exponents of \\(c\\) can be anything. But since \\(c\\) is separate, each term in the product will have \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by a term from the second polynomial. Therefore, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\) is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial.\n\nSo, that seems consistent. Therefore, I think 384 is the correct coefficient.\n\nWait, but let me check if I'm not making a mistake here. Because sometimes when you have separate variables, the coefficients don't just multiply like that. Wait, no, in this case, because we're considering the product of the two polynomials, each term from the first polynomial is multiplied by each term from the second. So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), I can think of it as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial. Because each term in the second polynomial contributes a coefficient that gets multiplied by the 6 from \\(a^2b^2\\), and since we're considering all possible powers of \\(c\\), we sum all the coefficients from the second polynomial.\n\nSo, I think that approach is correct. Therefore, the answer is 384.\n\nWait, but let me compute it again to be sure.\n\nFirst, \\((a + b)^4\\) gives \\(a^2b^2\\) with coefficient 6.\n\nThen, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) evaluated at \\(c = 1\\) is 2^6 = 64.\n\nSo, 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nI don't see any mistakes in this reasoning. So, I think the coefficient is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is found using the binomial theorem, which gives 6. The sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by evaluating it at \\(c = 1\\), resulting in 64. Multiplying these together gives the final coefficient as \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{384}"

So, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me think about how to expand that. Again, using the binomial theorem, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying that, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m} = \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, we need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be 0, which means \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20.

In \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the constant term is when \\(m = 3\\), and that's 20. So, 6 times 20 is 120. Yeah, that seems right. I don't think I made any mistakes here.

    "text": " Wait, no, actually, the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, maybe the entire expression is being multiplied, but since we're only looking for \\(a^2b^2\\), the \\(c\\) terms will just contribute a factor, but since \\(a^2b^2\\) is independent of \\(c\\), perhaps the coefficient is just the product of the coefficients from each part. Let me think again. So, the expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). If I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), then regardless of what happens with \\(c\\), the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will be multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and not any specific term involving \\(c\\), maybe I just need to consider that the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and then multiply it by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that doesn't seem right because we're not combining like terms across different \\(c\\) powers. Alternatively, perhaps each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, the coefficient would just be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, no, that might not be correct because each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) has a specific power of \\(c\\), but since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), perhaps the coefficient is just 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that doesn't make sense because we're looking for a coefficient, not an expression. Maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, considering all possible terms, but since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, no, because when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second, but here, \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) are separate, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean that \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by every term in the \\(c\\) expansion, which would mean that the coefficient isn't just a single number, but rather a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so maybe it's just the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the coefficient from the \\(c\\) expansion. Wait, no, because the \\(c\\) expansion is separate, so perhaps the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems odd because then the coefficient would be a polynomial, not a single number. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which would just be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the \\(c\\) expansion. Wait, no, the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) would be obtained by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, if I set \\(c = 1\\), the entire expression becomes \\((a + b)^4 \\times 64\\), and then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times 64, which is 384. But wait, is that correct? Let me think again. If I have \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), and I want the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), then the coefficient would indeed be 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the \\(c\\) expansion because each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in the \\(c\\) expansion, so the \\(a^2b^2\\) term would be multiplied by every term in the \\(c\\) expansion, effectively multiplying the coefficient 6 by the entire sum of the \\(c\\) expansion's coefficients. But wait, that seems a bit confusing. Alternatively, perhaps the coefficient is just 6, because the \\(c\\) terms are separate, and the problem is only asking about the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. Wait, no, that can't be right because the entire expression is a product, so the coefficients would multiply. Let me try another approach. Let me denote the first part as \\((a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^4 \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\\), and the second part as \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^6 \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^6 \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, when we multiply these two expansions together, each term in the first sum is multiplied by each term in the second sum. So, the product is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^4 \\sum_{m=0}^6 \\dbinom{4}{k} \\dbinom{6}{m} a^{4 - k}b^k c^{6 - 2m}\\). Now, we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, we need to find all terms where \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). So, \\(k = 2\\), which gives us the coefficient \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\), and the term \\(a^2b^2\\). Now, this term is multiplied by each term in the \\(c\\) expansion, so the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 multiplied by the entire \\(c\\) expansion, but since we're only interested in the coefficient, and not the specific \\(c\\) terms, perhaps the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the \\(c\\) expansion. The sum of all coefficients in the \\(c\\) expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\(\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times 64, which is 384. Wait, but that seems high. Let me check again. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, so it's just 6, but that seems too simple. Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it, and the problem is actually just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), it's just 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the \\(c\\) expansion, which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. Hmm, but maybe I should think differently. Let me consider that the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). If I expand both parts separately, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term comes from \\((a + b)^4\\) with coefficient 6, and it's multiplied by every term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The sum of coefficients in a polynomial is found by substituting 1 for all variables. So, substituting \\(c = 1\\), we get \\(\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384. So, I think that's the answer. But let me verify. Alternatively, maybe the problem is considering the entire expression, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 multiplied by each term in the \\(c\\) expansion, but since the problem is asking for the coefficient, perhaps it's just 6 times the entire \\(c\\) expansion, but that would make the coefficient a polynomial, which doesn't make sense. Therefore, I think the correct approach is that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the \\(c\\) expansion, which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. So, the final answer is 384. Wait, but let me check again. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, so the coefficient would be 6, because the \\(c\\) terms are separate. But that seems incorrect because when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficients multiply. So, for example, if you have (polynomial in a and b) times (polynomial in c), then the coefficients of terms that don't involve c would just be the coefficients from the a and b polynomial, because they're multiplied by the constant term (if any) in the c polynomial. But in this case, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) doesn't have a constant term unless 6 - 2m = 0, which would be when m = 3. So, the constant term is when m = 3, which is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} c^{0} = 20\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial is 6, and it's multiplied by the constant term 20 from the second polynomial. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 * 20 = 120. Wait, that makes more sense. So, perhaps I was wrong earlier. Let me go through this again. When we multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the only term in the \\(c\\) expansion that will contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, i.e., the constant term. Because if we have any other term with \\(c\\) raised to a power, then the product would have \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by \\(c^k\\), which is not just \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, only the constant term in the \\(c\\) expansion will contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, let's find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem, the general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We want the exponent of \\(c\\) to be zero, so 6 - 2m = 0 => m = 3. Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, multiplied by the constant term from the \\(c\\) expansion, which is 20. So, 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient is 120. Wait, that seems more reasonable. So, earlier, I thought it was 384, but that was because I was considering multiplying by all terms, but actually, only the constant term contributes to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the correct coefficient is 120. Let me verify this again. So, \\((a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. Then, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) has terms involving various powers of \\(c\\), but only the constant term (where \\(c^0\\)) will, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), result in a term that is just \\(a^2b^2\\). All other terms would have \\(c\\) raised to some power, so they would contribute to terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), which aren't \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, only the constant term in the \\(c\\) expansion affects the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). The constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, which happens when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), so \\(m = 3\\). The coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 * 20 = 120. So, I think that's the correct answer. I must have made a mistake earlier when I considered multiplying by all terms in the \\(c\\) expansion. It makes sense now that only the constant term contributes to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient is 120.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term with \\(a^2b^2\\) occurs when \\(k = 2\\):\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} a^{2}b^{2} = 6a^2b^2\n   \\]\n   So, the coefficient is 6.\n\n2. **Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m}\\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n   \\]\n   We need the constant term (where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0):\n   \\[\n   6 - 2m = 0 \\implies m = 3\n   \\]\n   The constant term is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\n   \\]\n\n3. **Multiply the coefficients from each expansion:**\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the product of the coefficients from each part:\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 20 = 120\n   \\]\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break down the problem into two parts:\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term with \\(a^2b^2\\) occurs when \\(k = 2\\):\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} a^{2}b^{2} = 6a^2b^2\n   \\]\n   So, the coefficient is 6.\n\n2. **Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m}\\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n   \\]\n   We need the constant term (where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0):\n   \\[\n   6 - 2m = 0 \\implies m = 3\n   \\]\n   The constant term is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\n   \\]\n\n3. **Multiply the coefficients from each expansion:**\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the product of the coefficients from each part:\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 20 = 120\n   \\]\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}."

    "text": " Wait, no, actually, the expression is a product of two separate binomial expansions. So, maybe I should think of it as multiplying each term from \\((a + b)^4\\) by each term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), perhaps I can treat the \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) part as a constant with respect to \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). Hmm, that might not be the right way to think about it. Wait, no, actually, when you multiply two expressions together, each term from the first expression gets multiplied by each term from the second expression. So, if I'm looking for a term that's just \\(a^2b^2\\), it would come from taking the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from \\((a + b)^4\\) and multiplying it by the constant term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because if I take any term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) that has a power of \\(c\\), then when I multiply it by \\(a^2b^2\\), the resulting term would have \\(a^2b^2\\) times some power of \\(c\\), which is not what we want. So, we only want the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, meaning \\(c^0 = 1\\), so that when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), it just gives \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, let me first find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Let me compute that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Now, going back to the original expression, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, as we found earlier. So, the total coefficient in the product would be 6 multiplied by 20, right? Because when you multiply the two expressions together, the coefficients multiply. So, 6 times 20 is 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't miss anything. So, the key idea is that when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each polynomial. Since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), we're only concerned with the constant term in the second polynomial, which is 20. So, 6 times 20 is indeed 120. So, I think that's the answer. Alternatively, maybe I can think of it as the entire expression being the product of two independent binomial expansions, so the coefficient is just the product of the coefficients from each expansion.

But since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient would be the same as the coefficient in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion, which isn't possible because a coefficient is a single number. So, maybe I'm making a mistake here. Let me think differently. Perhaps the question is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, when we multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second part, but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), we can treat the second part as a constant multiplier because \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\). Wait, that might make sense. So, if I consider \\((a + b)^4\\) times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but the sum of all coefficients in a polynomial is found by setting all variables to 1. So, if I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of all coefficients in the second part is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 times 64, which is 384. Is that correct? Wait, but I'm not sure if that's the right approach. Let me check. Alternatively, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, and since \\(a^2b^2\\) is only in the first part, the coefficient is just 6 times the entire second expression. But that would mean the coefficient is 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which isn't a number but a polynomial. So, that can't be right because the question is asking for a coefficient, which should be a number. So, perhaps I need to consider that when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is only affected by the constant term in the second polynomial. Wait, but \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) doesn't have a constant term unless there's a term where the exponent of \\(c\\) cancels out. Let me check that. Using the binomial theorem, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the exponents of \\(c\\) go from \\(6\\) to \\(-6\\) in steps of 2. So, the constant term (where the exponent is 0) occurs when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which is when \\(m = 3\\). So, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} c^{0} = 20\\). So, the only term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) that doesn't involve \\(c\\) is 20. Therefore, when we multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by 20, and all other terms will involve \\(c\\) to some power. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is just 6 (from \\((a + b)^4\\)) multiplied by 20 (the constant term from the second part), which is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). That makes sense because only the constant term in the second part will contribute to the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the product. So, the coefficient is 120. Wait, but earlier I thought about summing all coefficients, which gave me 64, but that was a mistake because only the constant term contributes to the \\(a^2b^2\\) term without any \\(c\\) involved. So, the correct approach is to find the constant term in the second polynomial and multiply it by the coefficient from the first part. So, I think the answer is 120. Let me double-check. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, 6 times 20 is indeed 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120. I think that's the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is found using the binomial theorem, which gives us 6. The constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying these together gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\boxed{120}."

So, when we multiply these two expressions together, each term from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term from the second expansion. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), we can focus on the part of the product that gives \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because when we multiply, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part will be multiplied by every term from the second part, but we don't care about the \\(c\\) terms because the problem is only asking for \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, no, that doesn't make sense because \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term in the first part, and when multiplied by the second part, it will create terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2 \\times \\dfrac{1}{c^k}\\), but the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me try a different approach. Since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), perhaps I can treat the second part as a constant with respect to \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). So, the coefficient would be 6 (from the first part) multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part, but since we're only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), maybe that's not the case. Wait, no, that might not be right because the second part is being multiplied by the first, so each term in the first expansion is being multiplied by each term in the second. But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), perhaps we can ignore the second part because it's being multiplied by terms that don't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) exponents. Wait, that doesn't make sense either. Let me think again. If I have \\((a + b)^4\\) times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), then when I expand this product, each term will be of the form \\(a^{4 - k}b^k \\times c^{6 - m}(1/c)^m\\) or something like that. But the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first part, and when multiplied by any term from the second part, it becomes \\(a^2b^2 \\times c^{...}\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be the coefficient from the first part, 6, multiplied by the sum of all coefficients from the second part. Wait, is that correct? Because when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term is the product of the coefficients from each polynomial. So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which comes from the first part, then the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients from the second part, which is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But wait, the sum of all coefficients in a polynomial is found by setting all variables to 1. So, if I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(1 + 1/1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of all coefficients in the second part is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 times 64, which is 384. Wait, but that seems too straightforward. Let me check if that's correct. Alternatively, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Wait, actually, when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term is the product of the coefficients from each polynomial for that term. But in this case, \\(a^2b^2\\) is only present in the first polynomial, and when multiplied by any term in the second polynomial, it would create terms with \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2 \\times c^{-k}\\). However, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). Wait, no, that's not correct. Because when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second, so the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first polynomial would be multiplied by each term in the second polynomial, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), etc., depending on the expansion. But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not considering the \\(c\\) terms. Wait, that can't be right because the entire expression is a product of two polynomials, so each term will have both \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) and \\(c\\) parts. Therefore, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) by itself doesn't exist in the product unless we consider the coefficients across all possible \\(c\\) terms. Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try to break it down more carefully.\n\nFirst, let's consider the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\). As I did before, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. Now, the second part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let's expand this using the binomial theorem as well. The expansion is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, each term in this expansion is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\) for \\(m\\) from 0 to 6.\n\nNow, when we multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term from the first expansion is multiplied by each term from the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term from the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part (which is 6) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients from the second part. Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, the coefficient for each such term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\), and since we're summing over all \\(m\\), it's equivalent to the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion.\n\nBut wait, the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\). So, substituting \\(c = 1\\) into \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion is 64. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 64 (sum of coefficients from the second part), which equals 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but is that correct? Because each term in the second expansion is a coefficient times a power of \\(c\\), but when we're considering the product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is being multiplied by each of these terms, so the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2c^{6 - 2m}\\) would be 6 * \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not considering the \\(c\\) terms. Hmm, maybe I'm misinterpreting the question. Perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, regardless of the power of \\(c\\). That is, it's considering all terms where \\(a\\) is squared and \\(b\\) is squared, regardless of the exponent on \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should think of it differently. Since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), but in the product, \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by various powers of \\(c\\). So, actually, there isn't a single term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product; instead, there are terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), etc. Therefore, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), which would be the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by 6. So, that would indeed be 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. Another way to think about it is that when you have two polynomials multiplied together, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum of the products of the coefficients of terms whose exponents add up to that term. But in this case, since we're looking for \\(a^2b^2\\), and the first polynomial only has terms with \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), while the second polynomial only has terms with \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), then the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is to take the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first polynomial and multiply it by every term from the second polynomial. Therefore, the coefficient would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial (which is 6) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial (which is 64). So, 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem had asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some specific \\(k\\), then we would have to consider the corresponding term in the second expansion. But since it's just \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\), the coefficient is the product of 6 and 64, which is 384.\n\nWait, but let me check if that's the case. Let me think about a simpler example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^1 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, the expansion would be \\((a + b)(c + 1/c)\\). The coefficient of \\(a^1b^0\\) would be the coefficient of \\(a\\) in the first part (which is 1) multiplied by the sum of coefficients in the second part, which is \\(1 + 1 = 2\\), so the coefficient of \\(a\\) in the product would be 2. Similarly, the coefficient of \\(b\\) would be 2 as well. So, in this case, the coefficient of \\(a^1b^0\\) in the product is indeed 2, which is the coefficient from the first part (1) times the sum of coefficients from the second part (2). So, that seems to confirm my approach.\n\nTherefore, applying the same logic, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) would be 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 64 (sum of coefficients from the second part), which is 384.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not missing anything. The problem is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, when you expand this, you'll have terms like \\(a^4b^0c^6\\), \\(a^4b^0c^4\\), ..., down to \\(a^0b^4c^{-6}\\). But the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is present only once in the first part, and when multiplied by each term in the second part, it creates terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), etc. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by 6, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but another way to think about it is that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in the product, every term that has \\(a^2b^2\\) will have some power of \\(c\\), but the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the sum of all those coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by 6. So, that would be 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem had asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then we would have to find the term where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out, which would be when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), so \\(m = 3\\). In that case, the coefficient would be 6 * \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\) = 6 * 20 = 120. But that's not the case here; the problem is just asking for \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), so it's the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion times 6, which is 384.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because sometimes when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms. But in this case, since the second polynomial doesn't have any \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would just be the coefficient from the first polynomial times the sum of all coefficients from the second polynomial. So, that makes sense.\n\nLet me try to write this out more formally. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). The sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is obtained by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\(2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, when multiplying these two polynomials, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\nWait, but let me make sure that's correct. Let me think of it as the product of two polynomials. The first polynomial is \\(P(a, b) = (a + b)^4\\), and the second is \\(Q(c) = \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). The product is \\(P(a, b) \\times Q(c)\\). So, any term in the product will be of the form \\(a^{4 - k}b^k c^{6 - 2m}\\), where \\(k\\) and \\(m\\) are integers between 0 and 4 and 0 and 6, respectively. So, if we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then we need to sum over all \\(m\\) the coefficients from \\(Q(c)\\). So, the coefficient would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} \\times \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m}\\). But \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} = 2^6 = 64\\), so the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\nAlternatively, if the problem had specified a particular power of \\(c\\), say \\(c^0\\), then we would have to find the term where \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which gives \\(m = 3\\), and then the coefficient would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} \\times \\dbinom{6}{3} = 6 \\times 20 = 120\\). But since the problem doesn't specify any power of \\(c\\), just \\(a^2b^2\\), the coefficient is the product of 6 and 64, which is 384.\n\nWait, but I'm still a bit unsure because sometimes when you have variables involved, you might have to consider if there's any overlap or if the terms could combine in a way that affects the coefficient. But in this case, since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are all distinct variables, their exponents don't interfere with each other. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is indeed 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 64, so 384.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, which includes all possible powers of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient would be the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by the coefficient from the first expansion for \\(a^2b^2\\). So, that would be 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me make sure that this approach is correct. Let me take a simpler example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, expanding this, we get \\((a^2 + 2ab + b^2)(c + 1/c)\\). The coefficient of \\(a^2b^0\\) would be the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) in the first part (which is 1) multiplied by the sum of coefficients in the second part (which is 2), so 1 * 2 = 2. Similarly, the coefficient of \\(ab\\) would be 2 * 2 = 4, and the coefficient of \\(b^2\\) would be 1 * 2 = 2. So, in this case, the coefficients of \\(a^2\\), \\(ab\\), and \\(b^2\\) in the product are 2, 4, and 2 respectively. This seems to confirm that the approach of multiplying the coefficient from the first expansion by the sum of coefficients from the second expansion is correct.\n\nTherefore, applying this to our original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 (from the first expansion) multiplied by 64 (sum of coefficients from the second expansion), which equals 384.\n\nWait, but another thought: when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a term in the product is the sum of the products of coefficients of terms whose exponents add up to that term. But in this case, since the second polynomial only has terms with \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), and the first polynomial only has terms with \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) in the product are determined solely by the first polynomial, and the exponents of \\(c\\) are determined by the second. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is indeed the coefficient from the first polynomial times the sum of all coefficients from the second polynomial, because every term in the second polynomial contributes to the coefficient when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). So, that makes sense.\n\nTherefore, I think I've reasoned through this correctly, and the coefficient is 384.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break down the problem as follows:\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\), so its coefficient is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\n   \\]\n\n2. **Consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n   \\]\n   The sum of all coefficients in this expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\):\n   \\[\n   (1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\n   \\]\n\n3. **Multiply the coefficient from the first expansion by the sum of coefficients from the second expansion:**\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 64 = 384\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is \\(\\boxed{384}\\)."

    "text": " Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, no, because the entire expression is a product of two separate expansions. So, actually, when we multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), that term must come from the part of the product where the \\(c\\) terms multiply to give a constant term, because otherwise, the term would involve \\(c\\) raised to some power, and we don't want that. So, maybe I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and then multiply it by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because \\(c^0\\) is 1, which doesn't affect the term. So, that makes sense. So, first, I have the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) as 6, as I found earlier. Now, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me think about how to expand that. Again, using the binomial theorem, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying that, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m} = \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be 0, so we set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). So, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Let me compute that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Now, since we're multiplying the two expressions together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product will be the product of the two coefficients I found. So, that's 6 (from \\(a^2b^2\\)) multiplied by 20 (from \\(c^0\\)). So, 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is 120. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Let me go through it again. So, first, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Then, in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term where \\(c\\) cancels out is when the exponent is 0, which happens when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), so \\(m = 3\\), giving \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, when we multiply these two parts together, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second. But since we're only interested in the \\(a^2b^2\\) term, which doesn't involve \\(c\\), it's only the product of the coefficients where the \\(c\\) terms cancel out, which is exactly the 6 * 20. So, 6 * 20 is 120. I think that's correct. Alternatively, maybe I can think of it as the entire expression being \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), and we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term comes from \\((a + b)^4\\) and is multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and not any specific power of \\(c\\), perhaps we can consider that the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will have the coefficient 6, and then multiplied by the sum of all terms in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but that doesn't make sense because we need to find a specific coefficient, not the sum. Wait, no, because the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\)'s power. Wait, but in the product, each term is \\(a^2b^2 \\times\\) something involving \\(c\\). So, unless we're looking for \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^k\\), but the problem doesn't specify any power of \\(c\\), just \\(a^2b^2\\). Hmm, maybe I misread the problem. Let me check again. The problem says: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but in the entire product. So, in the product, each term would be of the form \\(a^kb^{4 - k}c^m\\), where \\(k\\) is from 0 to 4, and \\(m\\) is from, say, -6 to 6, depending on the expansion. But the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would correspond to \\(k = 2\\). But in that case, when \\(k = 2\\), the term would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}a^2b^2 \\times\\) [the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\)]. But wait, that's not possible because the entire expansion is multiplied. So, actually, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by each term in the \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) expansion, but since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, perhaps we can treat the \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) part as contributing a scalar multiple. Wait, but that doesn't make sense because each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is a different power of \\(c\\), so when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), each would give a different term. So, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), because otherwise, the term would have some power of \\(c\\), and the problem doesn't specify. So, maybe I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be the product of the coefficients from each part where the exponents add up appropriately. So, in that case, from \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, and from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20, so the total coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120. Alternatively, if the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then it's more complicated because \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by all the terms in the \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) expansion, each contributing a different power of \\(c\\). But since the problem didn't specify any particular power of \\(c\\), maybe it's just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) irrespective of \\(c\\), meaning we can treat the \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) as a constant. But that doesn't make sense because \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is not a constant; it's an expression in \\(c\\). So, perhaps the problem is implicitly assuming that we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), which would make sense because otherwise, the term would involve \\(c\\) to some power, and the problem didn't specify. So, going back, I think the correct approach is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 20, and then multiply them together to get 120. So, I think that's the answer. Wait, but let me think again. If the problem had just been \\((a + b)^4\\), then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. If it's multiplied by another expression, say \\(X\\), then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the entire expression \\(X\\), but that's not the case here because \\(X\\) is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is a sum of terms involving different powers of \\(c\\). So, when we multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in the expansion would be \\(a^kb^{4 - k}c^m\\), where \\(k\\) ranges from 0 to 4 and \\(m\\) ranges from -6 to 6. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by each term in the \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) expansion, resulting in \\(a^2b^2c^m\\) for each \\(m\\). Therefore, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), then it's actually the sum of all the coefficients where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any power of \\(c\\). But that would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), so \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). So, 6 * 64 = 384. But that seems different from the earlier approach. Wait, but that can't be right because the problem is likely expecting a specific coefficient, not the sum. So, perhaps the problem is indeed asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120, as I originally thought. Alternatively, maybe the problem is only considering the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) parts and ignoring the \\(c\\) terms, but that seems unlikely because the entire expression includes \\(c\\). So, perhaps the correct interpretation is that we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), which is 120. So, I think that's the right answer. Let me just confirm. So, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. In \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Therefore, when we multiply these two, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is 6 * 20 = 120. So, that's the answer. I think that's correct.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break down the problem as follows:\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\), so its coefficient is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\n   \\]\n\n2. **Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n   \\]\n   To find the term where \\(c^0\\), set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), giving \\(m = 3\\).

The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so maybe I can treat \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) as a separate part and just consider how it affects the coefficient when multiplied by the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from \\((a + b)^4\\). But actually, since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient would just be the product of the coefficients from each part. So, the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the coefficient from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)... wait, no, that's not quite right. Because when you multiply two expressions, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, if I'm looking for the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present, then I don't care about the \\(c\\) part because that's separate. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, that doesn't make sense because the \\(c\\) terms are separate.

So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by every term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), I think the coefficient would just be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) evaluated at the terms that don't involve \\(c\\). Wait, no, that's not possible because \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) only has terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), so when you multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), the resulting term will have \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some \\(k\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would only consider the constant term in \\(c\\), right? Because if you have a term like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the sum of all coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) that are multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). But wait, no, because \\(a^2b^2\\) is just a term in the first part, so when you multiply by the second part, which is in terms of \\(c\\), each term in the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by every term in the second part, which are in terms of \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, so that would mean we're looking for all the terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient from the first part, 6, multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part, because every term in the second part is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). But that doesn't make sense because the coefficient would then be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which isn't correct because we're just looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not considering the \\(c\\) terms. Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\), and the coefficient there is 6. Now, when you multiply this by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by every term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which are terms like \\(c^6\\), \\(6c^4\\), \\(15c^2\\), \\(20\\), \\(15c^{-2}\\), \\(6c^{-4}\\), \\(c^{-6}\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be \\(6a^2b^2 \\times \\left(c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15c^{-2} + 6c^{-4} + c^{-6}\\right)\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be the sum of all the coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) multiplied by 6. Wait, but that's not correct because we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is independent of \\(c\\). So, perhaps the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that can't be right because the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is when \\(c = 1\\), which would be \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, then the coefficient would be 6 * 64 = 384. But that seems too large, and I'm not sure if that's the correct approach. Alternatively, maybe the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just 6, and the \\(c\\) terms don't affect it because they're separate variables. Wait, but when you multiply two expressions, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by every term in the second part, which includes different powers of \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product. So, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is indeed 64, as I thought earlier. So, then 6 * 64 = 384. But I'm not sure if that's correct because the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is only present once in the first part, so when you multiply by the second part, the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of the second part. But that would mean the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, maybe I'm misunderstanding the question. Perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\). In that case, I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, first, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. Then, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is the middle term, which is when the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0. Using the binomial theorem, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, we need the exponent \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\). So, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire expression is 6 * 20 = 120. So, that's probably the correct answer. Wait, but earlier I thought it might be 384, but that was under the assumption that we're considering all coefficients, which doesn't make sense because we need to have \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by \\(c^0\\). So, yes, the correct approach is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part, which is 20, and then multiply them together to get 120. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120. Let me just verify that. So, \\((a + b)^4\\) gives \\(a^2b^2\\) with coefficient 6. \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) gives \\(c^0\\) with coefficient 20. Multiplying these together gives 6 * 20 = 120. So, that's the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is just \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the answer should be 120. I think that makes sense now.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\)** using the binomial theorem:\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term with \\(a^2b^2\\) occurs when \\(k = 2\\), so the coefficient is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\n   \\]\n\n2. **Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)** using the binomial theorem:\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n   \\]\n   The term with \\(c^0\\) (the constant term) occurs when \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\).

But since we're only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and that term doesn't involve \\(c\\), the only way that term can come about is if we multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part by the constant term from the second part. Because if we multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by any term involving \\(c\\), it would result in a term that includes \\(c\\) as well, which isn't what we're looking for. So, I think I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Once I have that, I can multiply it by 6 to get the overall coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\). So, let me focus on finding the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Again, I can use the binomial theorem here. The expansion is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying each term, that's \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m} = \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero because that's the constant term. So, set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20.

So, putting it all together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120. Wait, let me just make sure I didn't miss anything here. So, I considered that the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part must be multiplied by the constant term from the second part to get a term without any \\(c\\). That makes sense because if we multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by any term involving \\(c\\), the result would include \\(c\\), which isn't what we want. So, yes, I think that's correct. Therefore, the coefficient is 120. I don't think I made any mistakes in the calculations. The binomial coefficients are correct, and the exponents add up properly. So, I'm confident that 120 is the right answer.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is found using the binomial theorem, which gives us 6.

So, that would be 6 times 64, which is 384. Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating, and the answer is simply 6, but that seems too small because the second part also contributes coefficients. Wait, no, because in the product, each term from the first expansion is multiplied by each term from the second, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is indeed 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, giving 384. So, is that the answer?\n\nWait, but let me check this again. Let me consider \\((a + b)^4\\). The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. Then, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) can be expanded using the binomial theorem as well. The expansion is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(1/c\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\) for \\(k\\) from 0 to 6. Now, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion, which has a coefficient of 6, is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be 6 times the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion. Because each term in the second expansion has a coefficient, and when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), it becomes part of the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2c^{6 - 2k}\\). But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), we need to sum all the coefficients from the second expansion and multiply by 6.\n\nWait, but the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion is when \\(c = 1\\), so \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). Hmm, that seems correct. So, is the answer 384?\n\nWait, but let me think again. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating and the problem just wants the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, considering all possible terms. But wait, in the product, each term is a product of a term from \\((a + b)^4\\) and a term from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, for the term \\(a^2b^2\\), it's only coming from the term in \\((a + b)^4\\) that is \\(a^2b^2\\), which is 6, and then multiplied by every term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which has coefficients. Therefore, the total coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but I'm not sure if that's the correct approach. Maybe I should instead consider that the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), and we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, in effect, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without considering the \\(c\\) terms, so maybe it's just 6, but that seems too simple.\n\nWait, no, because the product is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), so when you expand it, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion is multiplied by every term in the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me test this with a simpler example to see if this approach is correct. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, \\((a + b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2\\), and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right) = c + 1/c\\). So, the product would be \\(a^2c + a^2/c + 2abc + 2ab/c + b^2c + b^2/c\\). Now, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually be zero because there's no \\(a^2b^2\\) term. Wait, but according to my previous approach, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^2\\) times the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)\\). The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^2\\) is zero because the highest power is \\(a^2\\) and \\(b^2\\) separately, not both together. So, zero times 2 (sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)\\)) is zero, which matches the actual expansion. So, that seems to check out.\n\nAnother test case: Let's say \\((a + b)^3 \\times (c + 1/c)^2\\). The coefficient of \\(a^2b\\) in \\((a + b)^3\\) is 3, right? Because \\((a + b)^3 = a^3 + 3a^2b + 3ab^2 + b^3\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b\\) is 3. Then, the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^2\\) is \\((1 + 1)^2 = 4\\). So, according to my approach, the coefficient of \\(a^2b\\) in the product would be 3 * 4 = 12. Let's check the actual expansion: \\((a + b)^3 = a^3 + 3a^2b + 3ab^2 + b^3\\), and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^2 = c^2 + 2 + 1/c^2\\). Multiplying these together, each term from the first is multiplied by each term from the second. So, the term \\(3a^2b\\) is multiplied by \\(c^2\\), \\(2\\), and \\(1/c^2\\), giving \\(3a^2bc^2 + 6a^2b + 3a^2b/c^2\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b\\) (regardless of the power of \\(c\\)) is 6. But according to my approach, it was 3 * 4 = 12, which is incorrect. So, my approach must be wrong.\n\nWait, that's a problem. So, in this test case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b\\) in the product is 6, but according to my previous method, it would have been 3 * 4 = 12, which is wrong. So, my initial approach is incorrect. Therefore, I need to rethink this.\n\nSo, what went wrong? In the test case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b\\) in the product is 6, but my method gave 12. So, perhaps the correct approach is not to multiply the coefficient from the first expansion by the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. Instead, maybe each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second, but the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) is just the coefficient from the first expansion times the coefficient from the second expansion for each term. But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), maybe we need to sum all the products of the coefficients from the first expansion and the second expansion where the first term is \\(a^2b^2\\). But in this case, the first expansion only has one term with \\(a^2b^2\\), which is 6, and then it's multiplied by each term in the second expansion, which has coefficients. So, the total coefficient would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion. But in the test case, that would have been 3 times 4 = 12, which was wrong because the actual coefficient was 6. So, perhaps that approach is incorrect.\n\nWait, but in the test case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b\\) in the product was 6, which is 3 times 2, where 2 is the coefficient of the constant term in the second expansion. So, perhaps the correct approach is to consider that only the constant term in the second expansion contributes to the coefficient of \\(a^2b\\) without any \\(c\\) terms. So, in other words, when you multiply \\(a^2b\\) by a term in the second expansion that has \\(c^0\\), which is the constant term, then the resulting term is \\(a^2b\\), and its coefficient is 3 times the coefficient of the constant term in the second expansion. So, in the test case, the second expansion was \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^2 = c^2 + 2 + 1/c^2\\), so the constant term is 2, so 3 * 2 = 6, which matches the actual coefficient. So, perhaps the correct approach is to find the coefficient of the constant term in the second expansion and then multiply it by the coefficient from the first expansion.\n\nWait, that makes sense because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by a term in the second expansion that has \\(c^0\\), you get \\(a^2b^2\\), and any other term would have \\(c\\) raised to some power, making it \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), which isn't just \\(a^2b^2\\). So, only the constant term in the second expansion contributes to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. Therefore, the correct approach is to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) and then multiply it by the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\).\n\nSo, let me try that. First, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\), as I calculated earlier. Now, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Let's expand \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem: \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(1/c\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which implies \\(k = 3\\). So, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nWait, but let me check this with my earlier test case to see if this approach works. In the test case, \\((a + b)^3 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^2\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b\\) would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b\\) in the first expansion times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion. The coefficient of \\(a^2b\\) in \\((a + b)^3\\) is 3, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^2\\) is 2, as we saw earlier. So, 3 * 2 = 6, which matches the correct coefficient in the test case. So, this approach seems correct.\n\nTherefore, applying this to the original problem: the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 20. So, multiplying these together gives 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 120.\n\nWait, but let me confirm this by expanding \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) more carefully. The expansion is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, when \\(k = 3\\), the exponent is \\(6 - 6 = 0\\), and the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, that's correct. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is indeed 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nSo, to recap: The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 20. Multiplying these gives 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break down the problem into two parts using the binomial theorem.\n\n1. **Expanding \\((a + b)^4\\)**:\n   Using the binomial theorem, the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is:\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\), so the coefficient is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\n   \\]\n\n2. **Expanding \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)**:\n   Using the binomial theorem, the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is:\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n   \\]\n   We need the coefficient of the constant term \\(c^0\\). This occurs when \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\). The coefficient is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\n   \\]\n\n3. **Combining the results**:\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is the product of the coefficients found above:\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 20 = 120\n   \\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}."

    "text": " Wait, no, actually, the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product. So, when we multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which comes from the first part, the \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) part will just contribute a scalar multiple, because \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\) at all. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that doesn't sound right. Because if I have \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by another expression, the coefficients from \\((a + b)^4\\) will be scaled by each term in the other expansion. But since \\(a^2b^2\\) is only present in \\((a + b)^4\\), it would be multiplied by the sum of all terms in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), right? So, perhaps the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 (the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\)) multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that seems complicated. Let me think again. Alternatively, maybe I can treat each part separately and then multiply the coefficients. Since \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from \\((a + b)^4\\), and the other part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), when expanded, will contribute terms involving \\(c\\), but since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), perhaps the entire \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is just a scalar multiple. Wait, but that's not the case because \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is a polynomial in \\(c\\) with multiple terms, so when multiplied by \\((a + b)^4\\), each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in the other expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) would be multiplied by every term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that seems a bit confusing. Let me try another approach. Maybe I can consider the entire product as \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), and we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), the coefficients involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are independent of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), perhaps the coefficient is just 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) would be obtained by setting \\(c = 1\\), right? Because substituting \\(c = 1\\) into the expression would give the sum of coefficients. So, let's calculate that. \\(\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = (2)^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 (from \\((a + b)^4\\)) multiplied by 64, which is 6 * 64 = 384. Hmm, but wait, is that correct? Let me check again. Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, and \\(a^2b^2\\) is independent of \\(c\\), then when we multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient would just be 6 times the sum of the coefficients of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). As I calculated earlier, the sum of coefficients is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 384. Wait, but let me think again. Alternatively, maybe I can consider that when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each polynomial. But in this case, since \\(a^2b^2\\) is only in the first polynomial, the second polynomial's entire expansion would scale the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, perhaps the coefficient is indeed 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, maybe I can think of it as the product of the two expansions, so each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is independent of \\(c\\), the coefficient would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, maybe I can think of it as the coefficient being 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is independent of \\(c\\), the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients of the second polynomial. So, 6 * 64 = 384. Therefore, I think the coefficient is 384.\n\nWait, but let me check if this makes sense. Let me try to compute the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) and see what the sum of coefficients is. The expansion is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, the coefficients are \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}\\) for each term. The sum of coefficients is when \\(c = 1\\), so it's \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} = 2^6 = 64\\), which matches what I had before. So, the sum is indeed 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 * 64 = 384. So, I think that's the answer.\n\nBut wait, let me think again. Is there another way to approach this? Maybe by considering the entire product and seeing if \\(a^2b^2\\) is affected by the \\(c\\) terms. But since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the \\(c\\) terms would just scale the coefficient, so the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384. Yeah, that seems consistent. Alternatively, if I were to write out the entire product, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) with coefficient 6 is multiplied by each term in the \\(c\\) expansion, so the total coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the \\(c\\) expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. So, I think that's correct.\n\nWait, but let me check for any possible mistakes. Did I correctly identify the coefficient in \\((a + b)^4\\)? Yes, for \\(a^2b^2\\), which is the term when \\(k = 2\\), so \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Then, the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. That seems right.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of it as the coefficient being 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is independent of \\(c\\), the \\(c\\) part just scales the coefficient, so it's 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nI think that's the correct approach. So, the coefficient is 384.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Suppose I consider the entire expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When expanding this, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by every term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384. So, yes, that seems correct.\n\nI think I've considered this from multiple angles and each time I get 384 as the coefficient. So, I'm confident that's the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{384}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break down the problem into two parts: the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) and the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\n1. **Expanding \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\):\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} a^{2}b^{2} = 6a^2b^2\n   \\]\n   So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\n2. **Considering the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   The sum of all coefficients in this expansion can be found by setting \\(c = 1\\):\n   \\[\n   \\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\n   \\]\n\n3. **Combining the results:**\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is the product of the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) and the sum of the coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 64 = 384\n   \\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{384}\\)."

But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), that means we need to find how many times \\(a^2b^2\\) appears when multiplied by other terms. Wait, no, actually, that's not quite right either. Because when you multiply two polynomials, the variables are independent, so \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part won't combine with anything in the second part because the second part only has \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, maybe the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just the same as the coefficient in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but since we're only looking for the term with \\(a^2b^2\\), it's just the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. But wait, that doesn't make sense because the second part is a separate variable. So, perhaps the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just the coefficient from the first part, and the second part doesn't affect it because it's multiplied by other variables. Hmm, I'm a bit confused here. Let me think again. So, the expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When we expand this, each term from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term from the second expansion. So, for example, \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by every term from the second part, which includes various powers of \\(c\\). But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, does that mean we have to consider all possible terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present, each multiplied by some power of \\(c\\), and then sum their coefficients? Or is it asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by any term in the second expansion? Wait, no, actually, the problem is phrased as \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", which suggests that we're looking for the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, the coefficient would be the product of the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) and the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). But that seems a bit off because the coefficient would then be a polynomial in \\(c\\), not a single number. Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me re-read the problem: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, the expression is a product of two polynomials: one in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the other in \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, when you multiply them together, the variables are independent. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term from the second polynomial. So, for example, \\(a^2b^2 \\times c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2 \\times c^5 \\times (1/c)\\), and so on. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is actually the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, not a single number. But the problem is asking for a coefficient, which is usually a single number. So, maybe I'm misunderstanding the question. Perhaps it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when considering all possible terms, but since \\(c\\) and \\(a, b\\) are independent variables, the coefficient would be the product of the coefficients from each part. Wait, no, that's not right. Let me think again. When you have two separate variables, \\(a, b\\) and \\(c\\), the coefficients are separate. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be the coefficient from the first part, multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. But since the problem is asking for a single coefficient, perhaps it's only considering the part related to \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and treating the rest as constants. Hmm, but that doesn't seem right either. Alternatively, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, that would mean that the coefficient is the product of the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) and the sum of all coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, the coefficients add up. So, the total coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 (from \\((a + b)^4\\)) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, the sum of all coefficients in a polynomial is found by plugging in 1 for all variables. So, for \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), if we set \\(c = 1\\), we get \\((1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of all coefficients is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 * 64 = 384. Wait, but that seems too straightforward. Let me check that again. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Perhaps the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which is the same as the coefficient in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since the variables are separate, the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion, which is 6 * (sum of coefficients). But as I calculated before, the sum of coefficients is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, maybe I should think of it differently. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first part, and in the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), so the coefficient would be 6 times each term in the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since the problem is asking for a coefficient, perhaps it's expecting a numerical value, so maybe I'm supposed to consider the entire expansion and find that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients, which is 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, maybe I'm misunderstanding and the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some \\(k\\), but since it's not specified, perhaps it's just \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating, and the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then since the other part is multiplied by it, but since we're only looking for \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\), the coefficient is 6 multiplied by the entire expansion, but that's not a single number. Hmm, maybe I'm missing something. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is a product of two separate expansions, and the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just the coefficient from the first part, because the second part doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. So, the coefficient would just be 6. But that seems too simple, and I think the problem is expecting more because it's given both parts. Alternatively, maybe I'm supposed to consider that the entire expression is a product, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the product of the coefficient from the first part and the entire second expansion, but since the second expansion has multiple terms, maybe the coefficient is a polynomial, but the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, so perhaps I'm supposed to find the constant term in the second expansion and multiply it by 6. Wait, that makes sense. Because if we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, then the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because the constant term is the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, so when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by that term, you get a term with \\(a^2b^2\\) and no \\(c\\). So, maybe that's the approach. So, first, find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6. Then, find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. So, let's find that. Using the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(k = 3\\). So, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 * 20 = 120. Wait, that seems more reasonable. So, let me recap. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Therefore, when you multiply the two expressions together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by 20, so the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120. Alternatively, if we were looking for \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by some power of \\(c\\), say \\(c^k\\), then the coefficient would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^k\\) in the second expansion. But since the problem doesn't specify any \\(c\\) term, I think it's safe to assume that we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which would mean considering the constant term in the second expansion. Therefore, the final coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120. Let me double-check that. So, in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). Setting the exponent to zero: \\(6 - 2k = 0\\) gives \\(k = 3\\). So, the term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} c^0 = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20. Then, multiplying by the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, we get 120. That makes sense. So, I think that's the correct answer. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) can be found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and then multiplying it by the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\):\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\n   \\]\n   So, the coefficient is 6.\n\n2. **Find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n   \\]\n   The constant term occurs when the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0:\n   \\[\n   6 - 2k = 0 \\implies k = 3\n   \\]\n   The constant term is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\n   \\]\n\n3. **Multiply the coefficients:**\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is:\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 20 = 120\n   \\]\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}."

But wait, that doesn't seem quite right because when you multiply two polynomials together, each term in the first gets multiplied by each term in the second. However, since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), maybe the coefficient will be the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that would mean the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion, which doesn't make sense because the problem is looking for a numerical coefficient, not an expression. Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Alternatively, perhaps the question is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, considering all possible terms, but since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), maybe the coefficient is just 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Wait, no, that's not right either because each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is a separate term involving different powers of \\(c\\), so when you multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), it would be \\(6 \\times\\) each of those terms, but since we're only interested in \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\), perhaps the coefficient is just 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that's not correct because each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is a separate term, so when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each of those terms, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times each of those coefficients. But since the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) part, perhaps the coefficient is 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Wait, but actually, when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in one polynomial is multiplied by all terms in the other polynomial. So, in this case, \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and when you multiply by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in that expansion will have a coefficient, and each of those will be multiplied by 6. But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, it's as if we're summing over all possible coefficients of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for any \\(k\\). So, the total coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But wait, the sum of all coefficients in a polynomial is found by plugging in \\(c = 1\\). So, if I substitute \\(c = 1\\) into \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), I get \\((1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 64. So, then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times 64, which is 384. But wait, is that correct? Let me check. Alternatively, maybe I'm making a mistake here because when you have a product of two expressions, the coefficient of a specific term in one part is multiplied by each term in the other part, but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), maybe each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is just a scalar multiplier. So, the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. Hmm, that seems plausible, but I'm not entirely sure. Let me think differently. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, so the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), not a scalar. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a scalar. So, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it, and the answer is just 6, because the \\(c\\) terms don't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. Wait, but that doesn't make sense because the entire expression is a product, so each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, maybe I should consider that when you have two polynomials multiplied together, the coefficient of a specific term in one polynomial is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each polynomial. So, in this case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) (since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't have any \\(c\\) terms) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is the middle term, which is when the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0. Wait, that's a good point. So, maybe I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), because that's the term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), and when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), it will give a term with \\(a^2b^2\\). So, let's find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(1/c\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, we want the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, that's 6 * 20 = 120. Wait, that makes more sense because we're specifically looking for the term where \\(c\\) cancels out, so the coefficient is 120. Let me double-check that. So, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. In \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. So, when we multiply these two expressions together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by the constant term 20 from the second part, so the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120. That seems correct.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought about summing all coefficients, but that approach gave me 384, which is different. So, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me clarify: when the problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\" in the product, it's referring to the term \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by any power of \\(c\\). But if we're just considering \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), then the coefficient would indeed be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but that would result in a polynomial where each term is \\(6 \\times\\) the corresponding term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a scalar, so perhaps I need to consider that in the product, \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but since the problem doesn't specify any particular power of \\(c\\), maybe it's considering all possible powers, meaning the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384. But now I'm confused because I have two different answers: 120 and 384. Which one is correct?\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is phrased as \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\" in the entire product, without specifying any power of \\(c\\). So, that would mean that \\(a^2b^2\\) can be multiplied by any power of \\(c\\), so the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384. But alternatively, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by \\(c^0\\), then it's 6 * 20 = 120. But the problem doesn't specify any power of \\(c\\), so maybe it's the first case, 384. But wait, that doesn't make sense because when you have a product of two polynomials, the coefficient of a term in one is multiplied by each term in the other, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which would mean that \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), so perhaps the coefficient is just 6 times the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 20, giving 120. That seems more plausible because otherwise, if we consider all coefficients, we'd be including terms with different powers of \\(c\\), which would make the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) a polynomial in \\(c\\), but the problem is asking for a scalar coefficient, so it must be referring to the coefficient when multiplied by \\(c^0\\). Therefore, the correct answer is 120.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Let's write out the product: \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). When you expand this, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, for \\(a^2b^2\\), the coefficient is 6, and it's multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for any \\(k\\) would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^k\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term without any \\(c\\), so we need the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 20 = 120. That makes sense because we're looking for the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2, and the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0. So, the coefficient is 120.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought about the sum of all coefficients, which would be substituting \\(c = 1\\), giving 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. But that would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times the sum of all \\(c\\) terms, which isn't what we want. So, I think the correct approach is to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 20, and multiply that by 6, giving 120. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 120.\n\nWait, but let me make sure. Let's take a simpler example. Suppose we have \\((a + b)^1 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, expanding, we get \\(a c + a (1/c) + b c + b (1/c)\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^1b^0c^1\\) is 1, and the coefficient of \\(a^1b^0c^0\\) is 0, because there's no term with \\(a c^0\\). Wait, but in this case, if we look for the coefficient of \\(a^1b^0\\), regardless of \\(c\\), it's 1 times (c + 1/c), so the coefficient would be 1 * (1 + 1) = 2? Wait, no, because in the product, each term is \\(a c\\), \\(a/c\\), \\(b c\\), \\(b/c\\). So, the term \\(a\\) would have coefficients from both \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), but since we're looking for \\(a^1b^0\\), it's \\(a c\\) and \\(a/c\\), so the coefficient of \\(a\\) is 1 * (1 + 1) = 2, but that's if we're considering the coefficient of \\(a\\) times any power of \\(c\\). But if we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a c^0\\), which is just \\(a\\), then it's 0 because there's no such term. Wait, but in our original problem, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by all terms in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 64, giving 384. But that contradicts the earlier approach where we considered only the \\(c^0\\) term. So, perhaps the confusion arises from whether we're considering the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\) or specifically \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). The problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", without specifying \\(c\\), so maybe it's the former, meaning 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let's go back to the simpler example. If I have \\((a + b)(c + 1/c)\\), and I want the coefficient of \\(a^1b^0\\), regardless of \\(c\\), it would be 1 times the sum of coefficients in \\(c + 1/c\\), which is 2, so the coefficient is 2. But if I look for the coefficient of \\(a^1b^0c^0\\), it's 0, because there's no such term. So, in the original problem, if the question is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), it's 6 times 64 = 384. But if it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), it's 6 times 20 = 120. But the problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", so it's ambiguous whether it's considering all \\(c\\) terms or just \\(c^0\\). Hmm, but in the context of polynomial multiplication, when you're asked for the coefficient of a term without specifying other variables, it's usually considering the term with all variables in their specified exponents, so in this case, \\(a^2b^2\\) would imply \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). Therefore, the correct coefficient is 120.\n\nWait, but let me check again. The problem is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, when we multiply these two, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part, which includes \\(c^6\\), \\(c^4\\), ..., down to \\(c^{-6}\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. But that would mean the coefficient is 384 for \\(a^2b^2\\) times any power of \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term without \\(c\\), so I think that's not the case. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, without considering \\(c\\), so it's 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 64, so 384. But I'm getting conflicting answers depending on how I interpret the problem.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is written as \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), and we're to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\). Therefore, we need to find the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2 and 2 respectively, and the exponents of \\(c\\) are 0. So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 20, so 6 * 20 = 120. That seems correct because we're specifically looking for the term \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), so the coefficient is 120.\n\nWait, but let me think again. If I have two polynomials, say \\(P(a, b)\\) and \\(Q(c)\\), then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(P(a, b) \\times Q(c)\\) is just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(P(a, b)\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(Q(c)\\), because each term in \\(P(a, b)\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(Q(c)\\). So, in this case, \\(P(a, b) = (a + b)^4\\) and \\(Q(c) = \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). The sum of all coefficients in \\(Q(c)\\) is found by substituting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\(2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 * 64 = 384. But that's only if we're considering the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\). However, if we're considering the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), it's 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nBut the problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", so it's ambiguous. However, in most mathematical contexts, when you're asked for the coefficient of a term in a product of polynomials, without specifying other variables, it refers to the term with those exponents and all other variables raised to zero. So, in this case, \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). Therefore, the coefficient is 120.\n\nWait, but to make sure, let me think about it differently. Let's consider that \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) are being multiplied together. So, the product is a polynomial in \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\). When we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), that would mean we're looking for all terms in the product where \\(a\\) is squared and \\(b\\) is squared, regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, that would include terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), ..., down to \\(a^2b^2c^{-6}\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the sum of all coefficients of terms where \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for any \\(k\\). Therefore, that would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but that's conflicting with the earlier approach where I considered only \\(c^0\\). So, which one is correct? I think it depends on the interpretation. If the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), then it's 384. If it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), it's 120. But the problem states \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", so it's more likely that it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), so 384. But that seems a bit counterintuitive because usually, when you're asked for the coefficient of a term, it's implied that all other variables are at their minimal exponents, typically zero. So, perhaps the correct answer is 120.\n\nWait, to resolve this, let me think about the definitions. The coefficient of a term in a polynomial is the numerical factor in front of the variables. So, if we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), that would imply that \\(c\\) is not present, or that \\(c\\) is at its minimal exponent, which is zero. Therefore, the coefficient is 120.\n\nBut wait, another way to think about it is that in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial is multiplied by every term in the second polynomial, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), etc., each with their own coefficients. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the sum of all coefficients of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for any \\(k\\), which is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384. So, perhaps that's the correct answer.\n\nWait, but I'm getting conflicting answers, so I need to clarify this. Let me look up the definition of \"coefficient of a term\" in a polynomial. According to standard definitions, the coefficient of a term like \\(a^2b^2\\) in a polynomial is the sum of all coefficients of monomials that are equal to \\(a^2b^2\\). However, in this case, \\(a^2b^2\\) can be multiplied by any power of \\(c\\), so the monomials would be \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for various \\(k\\). So, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\), then it's the sum of all coefficients of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for any \\(k\\), which is 6 times the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384. But if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), it's 6 times 20 = 120.\n\nGiven that the problem doesn't specify any power of \\(c\\), I think it's more likely that it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. But I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only considering the terms where the exponents of \\(c\\) are zero, so the coefficient is 120. Therefore, I think the correct answer is 120.\n\nWait, but to be thorough, let me compute both possibilities:\n\n1. If we consider the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), it's 6 * 20 = 120.\n\n2. If we consider the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), it's 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nBut the problem is phrased as \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", without mentioning \\(c\\), so perhaps it's the second case, 384. But I'm still unsure. Let me think of an example. Suppose we have \\((a + b)(c + 1/c)\\). The expansion is \\(ac + a/c + bc + b/c\\). The coefficient of \\(a\\) is 1, but if we consider the coefficient of \\(a\\) regardless of \\(c\\), it's 1 times the sum of coefficients in \\(c + 1/c\\), which is 2, so 2. But if we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a c^0\\), it's 0. So, in that case, the coefficient of \\(a\\) is 2, but the coefficient of \\(a c^0\\) is 0. So, in the original problem, if we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), it's 384, and the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is 120. Therefore, since the problem doesn't specify \\(c\\), it's likely asking for 384.\n\nWait, but in the example I just did, the coefficient of \\(a\\) is 2 because it's multiplied by both \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). But in our original problem, we're looking for \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), so maybe the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. That seems to make sense because when you have \\((a + b)^4\\) times a polynomial in \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the coefficient in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire polynomial in \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which, when considered as a scalar, is 6 times the sum of its coefficients, which is 64, so 384.\n\nWait, but that doesn't seem right because \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is a polynomial, not a scalar. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), resulting in a polynomial where each term is \\(6 \\times\\) the corresponding term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^k\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\), it's the sum of all coefficients of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for any \\(k\\), which is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 64, so 384. Therefore, the answer is 384.\n\nWait, but I'm getting confused because earlier I thought it was 120, but now I'm thinking it's 384. Let me try to clarify with another example. Suppose we have \\((a + b)^1 \\times (c + 1/c)^1 = ac + a/c + bc + b/c\\). The coefficient of \\(a\\) is 1, and the coefficient of \\(a\\) times any power of \\(c\\) is 1 times the sum of coefficients in \\(c + 1/c\\), which is 2. So, the coefficient of \\(a\\) in the product is 2. Similarly, in our problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nTherefore, I think the correct answer is 384.\n\nWait, but let me check this again. If I have \\((a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. Now, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) expands to a polynomial where the sum of coefficients is 64, as found by substituting \\(c = 1\\). Therefore, when I multiply these two, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times 64 = 384. Therefore, the answer is 384.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was 120 because I was considering only the \\(c^0\\) term, but now I'm convinced it's 384 because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\). So, the correct answer is 384.\n\nWait, but I'm getting conflicting thoughts here. Let me try to write out the product:\n\n\\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = [a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4] \\times [c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15c^{-2} + 6c^{-4} + c^{-6}]\\).\n\nNow, when we multiply these two, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first polynomial will be multiplied by each term in the second polynomial, resulting in terms like \\(6a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(6a^2b^2c^4\\), etc., each with their own coefficients. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the sum of all these coefficients, which is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is 384.\n\nWait, but let me confirm by calculating the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). The sum is when \\(c = 1\\), so \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So, the final answer is 384.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was 120 because I was considering only the \\(c^0\\) term, but now I realize that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), so it's 384.\n\nWait, but now I'm confused again because in the product, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is indeed 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is 384.\n\nBut I'm still unsure because I initially thought it was 120. Let me check with an example where I can compute manually.\n\nSuppose we have \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^2\\). Let's compute the coefficient of \\(a^2b^0\\).\n\nFirst, \\((a + b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2\\).\n\n\\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^2 = c^2 + 2 + 1/c^2\\).\n\nNow, the product is:\n\n\\(a^2(c^2 + 2 + 1/c^2) + 2ab(c^2 + 2 + 1/c^2) + b^2(c^2 + 2 + 1/c^2)\\).\n\nNow, the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) is 1 times each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^2\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2c^2\\) is 1, \\(a^2c^0\\) is 2, and \\(a^2c^{-2}\\) is 1. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) in the product, regardless of \\(c\\), is 1 + 2 + 1 = 4, which is 1 times the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^2\\), which is 4. So, that makes sense.\n\nSimilarly, in our original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is 384.\n\nWait, but in my earlier example, the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\) is 4"

    "text": " Wait, no, that doesn't seem right. Wait, actually, no, because the entire expression is a product of two independent binomial expansions. So, when you multiply them together, each term from the first expansion will multiply each term from the second expansion. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), that means we can just take the coefficient from the first part and multiply it by the entire expansion of the second part, but since we're only looking for the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) appears, which is independent of \\(c\\), perhaps the second part can be considered as a constant? Wait, that doesn't make sense because \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is definitely not a constant. Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again.\n\nWait, actually, when you have two expressions multiplied together, like \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the terms in the product will be all combinations of terms from each expansion. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is in the first part, the terms from the second part can be considered as constants in this context because they don't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But wait, that would mean the coefficient is 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which doesn't make sense because we need a numerical coefficient, not an expression involving \\(c\\). Hmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, in that case, the coefficient would just be 6, because when you multiply by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), it's just scaling the entire expression by that term, but the \\(a^2b^2\\) term would be multiplied by every term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Wait, no, that's not right. Because when you multiply two polynomials, each term from the first polynomial multiplies each term from the second polynomial. So, if we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), that term in the product would be \\(6a^2b^2\\) multiplied by every term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, perhaps we can consider that the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Wait, no, that's not quite right either. Alternatively, maybe the question is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), treating \\(c\\) as a variable, but since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't make sense because the coefficient should be a number, not an expression. Hmm, I'm getting confused.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to clarify the problem again. The problem is: What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, in the entire product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will appear multiplied by all possible terms from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Wait, but the sum of all coefficients in a polynomial is found by setting all variables to 1. So, if I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 * 64 = 384. But wait, let me check that.\n\nWait, no, that might not be correct. Because when you expand \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term is of the form \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - k}(1/c)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, the coefficients are \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}\\), and each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, when you multiply this by \\((a + b)^4\\), which has a term \\(6a^2b^2\\), the product will have terms \\(6 \\times \\dbinom{6}{k}a^2b^2c^{6 - 2k}\\) for each \\(k\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the sum over all \\(k\\) of \\(6 \\times \\dbinom{6}{k}\\), because each term from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) contributes a coefficient when multiplied by \\(6a^2b^2\\). But wait, that's the same as 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384, as I thought earlier. But let me make sure that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, the coefficient would just be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384. So, that's the answer.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. The sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is indeed found by substituting \\(c = 1\\), giving \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, yes, the sum is 64. Therefore, 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider that the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, but since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. So, I think my initial approach is correct: the coefficient is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me think again. When you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in one polynomial is multiplied by all terms in the other polynomial. So, in this case, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) with coefficient 6 is being multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384. So, I think that's the correct answer.\n\nWait, but maybe I should approach it differently. Let me expand both parts and see how it works. The first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), has the term \\(6a^2b^2\\). The second part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), when expanded, is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - k}(1/c)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, each term in the second expansion is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\\). Therefore, when you multiply the two expansions together, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) from the first part will multiply each term in the second part, resulting in terms like \\(6 \\times \\dbinom{6}{k}a^2b^2c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the sum of all coefficients from the second part multiplied by 6. Since each term in the second part has a coefficient of \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}\\), the sum of all these coefficients is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} = 2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the total coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, that makes sense. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 384. So, I think that's the answer.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of it as the product of two independent expansions. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6, and since the second part is multiplied by this term, the overall coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nYes, I think that's correct. So, the final answer should be 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\(2^6 = 64\\). Multiplying these together gives \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n**Answer:**  \n\\boxed{384}"

But that doesn't make much sense because the entire expansion would have many terms, but since \\(a^2b^2\\) is only from the first part, the coefficient would just be 6 times whatever the sum is from the second part. Wait, no, that's not quite right. Let me think again. When you multiply two expressions, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean that \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by every term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would actually be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that can't be right because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, not an expression involving \\(c\\). Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are only in the first part, and \\(c\\) is only in the second part, the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) don't interact with the terms involving \\(c\\). So, when you multiply them, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is still an expression, not a number. But the problem is asking for the coefficient, which should be a number. Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Is the problem asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, or is it asking for the coefficient when considering only \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) and treating \\(c\\) terms as separate? I'm a bit confused. Let me try to clarify. The original expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when expanded, it's a product of two polynomials. Each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is of the form \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\\), and each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is of the form \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, when you multiply them together, each term will be \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} \\dbinom{6}{m} a^{4 - k}b^k c^{6 - 2m}\\). Now, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, we need to find all terms where \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). So, \\(k = 2\\), which gives us \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Then, the \\(c\\) part is \\(c^{6 - 2m}\\), but since the problem doesn't specify any condition on \\(c\\), we just need to consider the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) term. So, the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that's not quite right either. Because in the product, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But the sum of the coefficients in a polynomial is found by setting all variables to 1. So, setting \\(c = 1\\), the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times 64, which is 384. Wait, is that correct? Let me double-check. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 64. So, when you multiply the two, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 * 64 = 384. Hmm, that seems high. Alternatively, maybe I'm supposed to consider that the \\(c\\) terms don't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms, so the coefficient is just 6, and the \\(c\\) part is separate. But that doesn't seem right because when you multiply, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), so the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) would indeed be 6 times the entire expansion of the \\(c\\) part. But the problem is asking for the coefficient, not the entire expression. So, maybe the answer is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the \\(c\\) part, which is 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it and the answer is just 6 because the \\(c\\) terms don't affect \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, no, because when you multiply, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) expression. But that would mean that \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by all the terms in the \\(c\\) expansion, which would give a coefficient that's 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the \\(c\\) expansion. So, 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, maybe I'm supposed to consider that the \\(c\\) terms are separate and that the coefficient is just 6, but I think that's not the case because the entire product is considered. Let me try another approach. Let's consider that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the product of the coefficients of \\(a^2b^2\\) in each part. But wait, no, that's not quite right because the two parts are multiplied together, so the coefficients multiply. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) (since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't have any \\(c\\) terms) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is the middle term, which is when the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0. So, let's find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We want the exponent of \\(c\\) to be 0, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which implies \\(m = 3\\). So, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the other part, which is 6 * 20 = 120. Wait, that makes more sense. Because when you multiply the two expressions, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part is multiplied by the constant term (c^0) from the second part, so their coefficients multiply. So, the coefficient would be 6 * 20 = 120. Hmm, so earlier I thought it was 384, but now I'm getting 120. Which one is correct? Let me think again. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product. So, in the product, each term from the first polynomial is multiplied by each term from the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first part, and it's multiplied by every term from the second part. But since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of the second part. But that would mean that the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), but the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. Therefore, perhaps the correct approach is to consider that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in the second part, which is 6 * 64 = 384. But that seems too large. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only considering the coefficient when \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by the constant term in the second part, which is 20, giving 6 * 20 = 120. So, which interpretation is correct? Let me check the problem statement again. It says: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, in the entire product, we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would include all possible combinations of \\(c\\) terms. But the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, not a term that includes \\(c\\). So, perhaps the intended interpretation is that we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, meaning that we need to sum over all possible \\(c\\) exponents. So, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which is 6 * 64 = 384. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when considering the entire expression, which would involve \\(c\\) terms. But since the problem is asking for the coefficient, which is a number, perhaps the answer is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second part, which is 384. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it and the answer is just 6, but that seems too simple. Let me try to think differently. Suppose I expand both expressions separately. The first part is \\((a + b)^4\\), which has terms up to \\(a^4\\) and \\(b^4\\). The second part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which has terms from \\(c^6\\) down to \\(c^{-6}\\). When I multiply these together, each term in the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), ..., \\(a^2b^2c^{-6}\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would actually be the coefficient from the first part (which is 6) multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, not a polynomial. So, perhaps the question is misworded, or I'm misunderstanding it. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is the constant term with respect to \\(c\\). In that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 20 = 120. That seems more plausible. So, perhaps the intended answer is 120. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, meaning that we're to treat \\(c\\) as a separate variable and just consider the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would be 6, and the rest would involve \\(c\\) terms. But that doesn't seem right because the product would have terms with \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by various powers of \\(c\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually be a polynomial in \\(c\\). Therefore, perhaps the correct interpretation is that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the constant term with respect to \\(c\\). In that case, as I calculated earlier, the coefficient would be 6 * 20 = 120. Alternatively, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, then the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * (c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15/c^2 + 6/c^4 + 1/c^6). But that's a polynomial, and the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, so that can't be right. Therefore, I think the intended interpretation is that we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. So, to summarize, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20, so their product is 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is 120. But since the problem just says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", perhaps it's intended to consider the entire product, meaning that the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of the second part, but that would be a polynomial, not a number. Therefore, I think the correct answer is 120, considering the constant term with respect to \\(c\\). So, I'll go with 120 as the coefficient.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by considering the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and the constant term in the second part. \n\n1.

So, perhaps the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is just 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but that's not a numerical coefficient. Hmm, maybe I'm approaching this wrong. Let me try again. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term will be of the form \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}a^{4 - k}b^{k} \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - m}(1/c)^m\\), which simplifies to \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}\\dbinom{6}{m}a^{4 - k}b^{k}c^{6 - 2m}\\). Now, we need the term where \\(a^2b^2\\), so \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). So, that part is fixed as \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Now, for each such term, the exponent of \\(c\\) is \\(6 - 2m\\), but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), perhaps the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all the coefficients from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that would be 6 times \\(2^6\\) because each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) has coefficients that sum to \\(2^6\\) when \\(c = 1\\). But I'm not sure if that's the right approach. Alternatively, maybe the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but that can't be because the problem is likely expecting a numerical coefficient. Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think again. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, so perhaps the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which seems odd because the question is just asking for a coefficient. Alternatively, maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where \\(c\\) is to the zero power, so that the coefficient is a constant. That might make more sense. So, if that's the case, then I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product. So, first, from \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, as before. Now, from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), I need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, because \\(c^0 = 1\\), which would make the entire term a constant. So, in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term with \\(c^0\\) is when the exponents from \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) cancel out. So, using the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - m}(1/c)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the exponent of \\(c\\) is \\(6 - 2m\\). We want \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), so \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire product would be the product of the coefficients from each part, which is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) (assuming \\(c^0\\)) is 120. But wait, the problem didn't specify anything about \\(c\\), it just said the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, does that mean it's considering all possible powers of \\(c\\), or is it just the constant term? Hmm, I'm a bit confused here. If it's just \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\), then the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but that would be a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense for a coefficient. So, maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) irrespective of \\(c\\), which would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). The sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) would be found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\(2^6 = 64\\). So, 6 times 64 is 384. But that seems high. Alternatively, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, so each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) would contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables, the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that can't be right because a coefficient should be a number, not a polynomial. So, perhaps I need to clarify: when the problem asks for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), it's considering all possible terms where \\(a\\) is squared and \\(b\\) is squared, regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem is likely expecting a numerical coefficient, so maybe I'm missing something. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only considering the term where \\(c\\) is to the zero power, so that the coefficient is a constant. In that case, as I found earlier, the coefficient would be 120. Let me check that again. So, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. In \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. So, multiplying these together gives 6 * 20 = 120. So, the term \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) would have a coefficient of 120. Therefore, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), but specifically the constant term, then the answer is 120. Alternatively, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without considering \\(c\\), then it's 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but that would be a polynomial, which doesn't make sense for a coefficient. Therefore, I think the intended answer is 120, considering only the constant term in \\(c\\).

Since the problem is only about \\(a^2b^2\\), and the other part is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), perhaps the coefficient is just 6 times the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Because each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) would be multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), so the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in that expansion. Alternatively, maybe I can think of it as the coefficient being 6 times the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But let me make sure. Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that when multiplying by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would have all the terms from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) multiplied by it. But since the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, then yes, it's 6 times the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, to find the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), I can substitute \\(c = 1\\) because that makes each term equal to its coefficient. So, substituting \\(c = 1\\), we get \\((1 + 1/1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 64. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 times 64, which is 384. Wait, but that seems a bit high. Let me check if that's correct. Alternatively, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me try another approach. Let me consider that \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the first part, so when I multiply it by the entire second part, the coefficient would indeed be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second part. Since the sum of the coefficients is 64, as calculated, then 6 * 64 = 384. So, the coefficient is 384. Wait, but maybe I should verify this. Alternatively, perhaps I can think of the entire expression as \\((a + b)^4\\) times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), and when we multiply them, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is present only in \\((a + b)^4\\), and it's multiplied by every term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, that would be 6 times 64, which is 384. Therefore, the answer is 384. But let me check if that makes sense. Alternatively, maybe I should consider that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second part, which is correct because each term in the second part is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), so the coefficient would accumulate all those contributions. So, yes, 6 * 64 = 384. Therefore, the coefficient is 384. So, putting it all together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by substituting \\(c = 1\\), giving \\(2^6 = 64\\). Multiplying these together gives \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\boxed{384}."

    "text": " Wait, but actually, no, because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product. So, maybe I need to think about how the terms interact when we multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me see. So, when you multiply two expressions, each term from the first expression gets multiplied by each term from the second expression. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), we can ignore the \\(c\\) terms because any term involving \\(c\\) would multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) and create a term with \\(c\\) in it, which isn't what we want. So, perhaps the only contribution to \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because if we multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by the constant term, we get \\(a^2b^2\\) times that constant, which would still be a term with \\(a^2b^2\\). If we multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by any other term involving \\(c\\), like \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), then the result would have \\(a^2b^2c\\) or \\(a^2b^2/c\\), which are different from \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me work on that. Using the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, because that's the constant term. So, set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(6 = 2m\\) so \\(m = 3\\). So, the constant term is when \\(m = 3\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} c^{0} = \\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20. Now, going back, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 multiplied by 20, which is 120. Wait, let me just make sure I didn't make a mistake here. So, the key idea is that when you multiply two expressions, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part can only be multiplied by the constant term from the second part to get a term that's just \\(a^2b^2\\). Any other terms from the second part would introduce \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), which would change the term. So, yes, that seems correct. So, the coefficient should be 6 times 20, which is 120. I think that's the answer. But just to double-check, maybe I should consider the entire expansion. Let me think: \\((a + b)^4\\) gives me terms from \\(a^4\\) down to \\(b^4\\), and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) gives me terms from \\(c^6\\) down to \\(c^{-6}\\). When I multiply them together, each term in the first expansion gets multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, which includes \\(c^6\\), \\(6c^4\\), \\(15c^2\\), \\(20\\), \\(15c^{-2}\\), \\(6c^{-4}\\), and \\(c^{-6}\\). So, the only term that when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\) gives a term without \\(c\\) is the constant term 20. So, \\(a^2b^2\\) times 20 is the only term contributing to \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient is 20 times the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, so 6 * 20 = 120. Yeah, that makes sense. I don't think I made any mistakes here.

Wait, but that might not be right. Let me clarify. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) would come from taking \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part and any term from the second part. But since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expression, each of those terms contributes to the overall coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. Wait, no, that's not correct because the second expression is a separate variable. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expression multiplied by the entire expansion of the second expression, but since the second expression is in terms of \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Wait, but the sum of all coefficients in the second part is when \\(c = 1\\), so \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, does that mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\)? Hmm, that seems plausible, but let me check again. Alternatively, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Perhaps the question is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which would mean that the coefficient is indeed the product of the coefficients from each part. So, in other words, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) (since \\(c^0 = 1\\)) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is the middle term, which would be \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, the overall coefficient would be \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Wait, that makes more sense because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by the constant term (which is \\(c^0\\)), you get \\(a^2b^2\\), and any other term would involve \\(c\\) to some power. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient from the first part times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part. So, let me go through this carefully.\n\nFirst, expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem. The term with \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient is 6.\n\nNext, consider \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). We need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\), which is the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. In the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - k}\\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\\). We need \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), so \\(2k = 6\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n\nNow, when we multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second part. However, only the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero will contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, because any other term would introduce a power of \\(c\\), making the term \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) where \\(k \\neq 0\\). Since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is independent of \\(c\\), we only consider the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. Therefore, the coefficient is the product of the coefficients from each part: \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nWait, but earlier I thought about the sum of all coefficients in the second expression being 64, but that's when \\(c = 1\\). But in reality, we need the coefficient of \\(c^0\\), which is 20. So, that makes sense because when you substitute \\(c = 1\\), the entire second expression becomes 64, but that's the sum of all coefficients, not just the constant term.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 from the first part and 20 from the second part, so 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, let me confirm this by expanding both expressions step by step.\n\nFirst, \\((a + b)^4\\):\n\n- The expansion is \\(a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6.\n\nNext, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):\n\n- The expansion is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - k}\\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\\).\n\n- We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\) gives \\(k = 3\\).\n\n- The coefficient for \\(k = 3\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\), so the term is \\(20c^0 = 20\\).\n\nTherefore, when we multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expression is multiplied by 20 from the second expression, resulting in \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\) as the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\).\n\nWait, but let me think again. When you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expression is multiplied by every term in the second expression. But since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, we only care about the terms where the product doesn't introduce any new variables. That is, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) times the constant term from the second expression. Because if you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by any term that has a \\(c\\) in it, you'll end up with a term that includes \\(c\\), which is not what we want. So, the only contribution to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is from \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by the constant term (i.e., \\(c^0\\)) in the second expression. Therefore, the coefficient is indeed \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nAlternatively, if I consider the entire product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be present in the expansion as \\(6a^2b^2\\) multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is of the form \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\\), and when multiplied by \\(6a^2b^2\\), gives \\(6 \\times \\dbinom{6}{k}a^2b^2c^{6 - 2k}\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, we set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), so \\(k = 3\\), as before. Thus, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nWait, but just to make sure I'm not making a mistake, let me think about this another way. Suppose I set \\(c = 1\\). Then \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = (1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, the entire expression becomes \\((a + b)^4 \\times 64\\). The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, so when multiplied by 64, it becomes \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). But this would be the case if I was looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, but that's not the case here. The problem specifically asks for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which implies that it's looking for the coefficient when considering all variables, but only focusing on the \\(a^2b^2\\) term, which would require that the \\(c\\) part is a constant, i.e., \\(c^0\\). So, perhaps I was correct the first time when I considered only the constant term, giving 120.\n\nWait, maybe I'm confusing the difference between evaluating at \\(c = 1\\) and considering the coefficient of \\(c^0\\). When I set \\(c = 1\\), I'm effectively summing all coefficients in the second expression, which gives me 64. But when I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I need to consider only the terms where \\(c\\) doesn't appear, so only the constant term. So, I think the correct approach is to take the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expression, which is 6, and multiply it by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expression, which is 20, resulting in 120.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of it as the product of the two expressions. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the sum over all possible ways to get \\(a^2b^2\\) by multiplying terms from each expression. But since the first expression only has \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the second has \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) is to take \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expression and the constant term from the second expression. Therefore, the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, let me check with an example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^4 = 6a^2b^2 + \\text{other terms}\\). And \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = 20 + \\text{other terms with }c\\). So, when I multiply these two, the term \\(6a^2b^2 * 20\\) gives \\(120a^2b^2\\), and any other terms would involve \\(c\\). So, yes, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought about setting \\(c = 1\\), which would give me 64, but that's not the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). That would just be the sum of all coefficients when \\(c = 1\\), but in reality, I need to find the coefficient specifically for \\(a^2b^2\\), which is 120.\n\nSo, to summarize, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 20, so the overall coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nI think that's the correct approach. Let me just make sure I didn't miss anything. Is there any other term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) that could contribute to \\(a^2b^2\\)? Well, no, because any term with \\(c^k\\) where \\(k \\neq 0\\) would result in a term like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), which isn't \\(a^2b^2\\) alone. So, only the constant term contributes. Therefore, the coefficient is indeed 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break down the problem into two parts: expanding \\((a + b)^4\\) and finding the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\n1. **Expanding \\((a + b)^4\\):**\n   Using the binomial theorem, the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is:\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term with \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\):\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\n   \\]\n   So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6.\n\n2. **Expanding \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   Using the binomial theorem, the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is:\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n   \\]\n   We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, which occurs when \\(6 - 2k = 0\\).

    "text": " Wait, no, actually, I think I might be overcomplicating it. Let me think again. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, so that would mean I need to consider the product of the two expansions. But since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), their coefficients won't be affected by the \\(c\\) terms. So, maybe the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, that doesn't make sense because when you multiply two expressions, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression. But since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is to take the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part and multiply it by the constant term from the second part, right? Because if I take any term involving \\(c\\) from the second part, then the resulting term would have \\(a^2b^2\\) times something with \\(c\\), which wouldn't be just \\(a^2b^2\\). So, perhaps the coefficient is the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and the constant term in the second part. That makes sense. So, first, I found that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. Now, I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). How do I find the constant term in a binomial expansion? Well, using the binomial theorem again. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying that, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m} = \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the exponent of \\(c\\) in each term is \\(6 - 2m\\). We want the term where the exponent is zero, because that's the constant term. So, set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20. Now, going back to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficients from each part, since we're multiplying the two expansions together. So, that would be 6 (from \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part) multiplied by 20 (the constant term in the second part). So, 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120.\n\nWait, let me double-check to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. So, first part: \\((a + b)^4\\), coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). That seems right. Second part: \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), looking for the constant term. The exponent for \\(c\\) is \\(6 - 2m\\), set that to zero, so \\(m = 3\\). \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). That seems correct. Then, multiplying 6 and 20 gives 120. So, yeah, I think that's right. I don't see any errors in the reasoning. So, the final answer should be 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is found by taking the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) and multiplying it by the constant term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\n1. Coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n2. The constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n3.

So, that should be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression. I don't think I missed anything here. Let me think if there's another way to approach this. Alternatively, maybe I can consider expanding both parts separately and then multiplying the specific terms, but I think that's what I just did. Yeah, I think 120 is the correct coefficient. So, the final answer should be 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20.

    "text": " Wait, no, actually, the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, maybe I can treat the entire \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) as a scalar factor that multiplies the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part. So, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all terms in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, that doesn't seem right because each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) would contribute differently. Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term in the product of the two expansions. So, actually, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part will be multiplied by every term in the second expansion. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, perhaps the coefficient is just the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part, but that seems off because each term in the second expansion would add a different power of \\(c\\). Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, actually, \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), so when we multiply the two expansions together, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will be multiplied by each term in the \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) expansion. But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) powers, we need to sum all the coefficients from the second expansion and multiply by the coefficient from the first part. Wait, but that would be the case if we were looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\). However, maybe the problem is actually looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), because otherwise, the coefficient would be an expression involving \\(c\\). Hmm, that might make more sense. So, perhaps I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product. Let me check: the problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", so it's possible that the \\(c\\) terms are being ignored, but that might not be the case. Alternatively, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) irrespective of the \\(c\\) terms, meaning we can treat the second part as a scalar. Wait, but that might not be correct because the second part is an expansion, and each term in it will multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term, so the overall coefficient would be the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all coefficients from the second part. Let me try that approach. So, the coefficient from the first part is 6, as we found earlier. Now, the second part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). To find the sum of all coefficients in this expansion, we can substitute \\(c = 1\\). So, when \\(c = 1\\), \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 * 64 = 384. But wait, is that correct? Let me think again. Because when we multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first part is multiplied by every term in the second part, so the coefficient would indeed be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which is 6 * 64 = 384. But wait, another way to think about it is that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part. Because when you multiply, the exponents of \\(c\\) would add up, so to get \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), you need the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part and the \\(c^0\\) term from the second part. So, perhaps that's the correct approach. Let me try that. So, first, find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6. Then, find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me compute that. Using the binomial theorem, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(k = 3\\). So, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product is 6 * 20 = 120. Wait, but earlier I thought it was 384, but that was when considering the sum of all coefficients. But now, considering only the \\(c^0\\) term, it's 120. So, which one is correct? I think I need to clarify the question. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). So, perhaps the question is just considering \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, meaning that the coefficient would include all the \\(c\\) terms. But that doesn't make much sense because \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term, and it's being multiplied by various powers of \\(c\\). So, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, which would be the sum of all coefficients from the \\(c\\) terms multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). So, in other words, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for any \\(k\\), but that's not standard. Usually, when you're asked for the coefficient of a specific term, it's in the entire expansion, considering all variables. So, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), because otherwise, the coefficient would be an expression in terms of \\(c\\), which isn't a coefficient but rather a term. So, maybe the correct approach is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). Therefore, the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120. Let me verify that again. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\) with coefficient 6. The term \\(c^0\\) comes from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) with coefficient 20. So, when you multiply these two terms, you get \\(6 * 20 * a^2b^2c^0\\), so the coefficient is 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 120. I think that makes sense. So, to recap: 1. Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) and find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is 6. 2. Expand \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) and find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\), which is 20. 3. Multiply these two coefficients together to get 120. So, the final answer should be 120. But just to make sure, let me consider another approach. Alternatively, we can think of the entire expression as a product of two independent expansions. So, when you multiply them, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the sum over all possible exponents of \\(c\\) of the product of the coefficients. But that seems more complicated, and I think the previous approach is correct because we're looking for the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\), so the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120. Yeah, I think that's the right answer.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by considering the product of the relevant coefficients from each part.\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\)**:\n   - The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the binomial expansion where \\(k = 2\\).\n   - Coefficient: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n\n2. **Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)**:\n   - The term \\(c^0\\) occurs when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero.\n   - This happens when \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), so \\(k = 3\\).\n   - Coefficient: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n\n3. **Multiply the coefficients**:\n   - The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer**: The coefficient is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

Because substituting \\(c = 1\\) into \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) gives \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of the coefficients is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 * 64 = 384. Wait, that seems plausible, but let me check if that's correct. Alternatively, maybe I'm supposed to consider that the entire expression is a product, and so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is indeed 64, so 6*64=384. But wait, another thought: when you multiply two expressions, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each expression. But in this case, since we're looking for \\(a^2b^2\\), which is only in the first part, and the second part doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), so the entire second part is just a scalar multiple. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient from the first part times the entire second expression. But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. So, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Wait, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some \\(k\\), but since it's not specified, maybe it's just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. In that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6*(something). But that something is a polynomial in \\(c\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be that polynomial. But the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, so maybe I'm missing something here. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating \\(c\\) as a variable, but the problem didn't specify any particular power of \\(c\\), so maybe it's just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), which would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that seems too broad because the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) has multiple terms. Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try another approach. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, when you multiply two expressions, the coefficient of a term in the product is the sum of the products of the coefficients of terms whose variables multiply to give that term. But since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), we can treat \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) as a constant with respect to \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that seems to suggest that the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which is more complicated than I thought. Wait, maybe the problem is expecting just the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but that would mean the coefficient is 6*(expansion), which isn't a single number. So, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Wait, maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion of the entire product, considering all terms, so the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). As I thought earlier, the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 64, so 6*64=384. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 384. Let me confirm this. Alternatively, perhaps I can think of it as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) being 6, and since it's multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, so 6*64=384. That seems to make sense. So, the final answer is 384. But wait, let me make sure I'm not missing anything. Alternatively, perhaps I can consider that \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) can be expanded, and each term in that expansion is a coefficient times \\(c^k\\) for some integer \\(k\\). So, when I multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), each term in the expansion would contribute a term like coefficient * \\(a^2b^2c^k\\). But the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would be the sum of all coefficients from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) multiplied by 6.

    "text": " Wait, no, actually, I think I might be overcomplicating it. Wait, no, actually, maybe I should consider that the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), so when I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), it's just the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that doesn't seem right because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would be a term that includes \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by some combination of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). But since \\(a^2b^2\\) is only from the first part, and the second part is multiplied by it, the coefficient would actually be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But wait, is that correct? Wait, no, perhaps not. Because when you multiply two polynomials, each term from the first polynomial is multiplied by each term from the second polynomial. So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), it's only the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part, and then any term from the second part will be multiplied by it. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 (the coefficient from the first part) multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients from the second part, because each term in the second part will contribute to the coefficient when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, but is that accurate? Let me think again. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is \\(6a^2b^2\\). Then, when we multiply this by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial in \\(c\\), the result will have terms like \\(6a^2b^2 \\times c^k\\) for various \\(k\\). But the question is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Because each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) contributes a coefficient that, when multiplied by 6, will give the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times that \\(c\\) term. But since we're just looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\), we need to sum all those contributions. Alternatively, maybe I can think of it as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) being 6 multiplied by the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, first, let's find the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). The sum of the coefficients in a polynomial is found by plugging in \\(c = 1\\). So, if I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(1 + 1/1\\right)^6 = (2)^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 times 64, which is 384. But wait, that seems too straightforward. Let me check if that's correct. Alternatively, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Maybe the question is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, which would include all possible powers of \\(c\\). But the way the problem is phrased, it's just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, in that case, yes, it's 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second part, which is 6 * 64 = 384. Wait, but let me think again. Alternatively, perhaps I'm supposed to consider that when you multiply the two expressions, each term from \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but that doesn't make sense because the coefficient would then be a polynomial in \\(c\\), not a single number. So, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Alternatively, perhaps the question is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, that would mean that the coefficient is 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but that's not a single coefficient. Wait, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), because otherwise, the coefficient would depend on the power of \\(c\\). So, maybe I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\). In that case, I would need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), then multiply them together. That makes more sense. So, perhaps that's the correct approach. So, first, as before, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. Now, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). How do I do that? Well, again, using the binomial theorem, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(1/c\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, the exponent of \\(c\\) in each term is \\(6 - 2k\\). We need the exponent to be 0, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product is 6 * 20 = 120. Wait, so earlier I thought it was 384, but that was when I considered the sum of all coefficients, which would be when \\(c = 1\\). But if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), then perhaps it's 6 times the entire expansion, which would be 6 * 64 = 384. But if it's asking for \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it's 120. Hmm, the problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\". It doesn't specify anything about \\(c\\), so perhaps it's just 6 times the entire expansion, which would mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 * 64 = 384. But that seems a bit odd because the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would then have a coefficient that's a polynomial in \\(c\\). Wait, no, actually, when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part would be multiplied by each term in the second part, which are terms involving powers of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), meaning that the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), not a single number. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which might be interpreted as the coefficient when considering all powers of \\(c\\), but that doesn't make sense because the coefficient is a function of \\(c\\). Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) independent of \\(c\\), which would mean the term where the power of \\(c\\) is zero. So, that would be the case where we have \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), so the coefficient would be 6 * 20 = 120. Hmm, that seems more plausible. Let me check that again. So, if we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), but that's not possible because \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term that's multiplied by different powers of \\(c\\). So, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be 120. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, which would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which is 6 * 64 = 384. But that would make the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) equal to 384 times \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that includes all the powers of \\(c\\). But that seems a bit confusing because the coefficient would then be a polynomial in \\(c\\), not a constant. So, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. Alternatively, maybe the problem is only concerned with the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) parts and ignores the \\(c\\) parts, but that seems unlikely because the expression includes both parts. So, perhaps I need to clarify: the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), meaning that the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, so perhaps it's only interested in the constant term with respect to \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is 120. Alternatively, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second part, which is 6 * 64 = 384. But that would mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 384, which is a constant, but in reality, when you multiply by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial, so the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\). Therefore, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. Alternatively, maybe the problem is miswritten, and it's supposed to ask for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which would be 6 * 20 = 120. That seems more reasonable. So, perhaps that's the correct approach. Let me verify this. So, \\((a + b)^4\\) has a term \\(6a^2b^2\\), and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) has a term \\(20c^0\\). So, when you multiply them, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient is 120. So, I think that's the correct answer. Wait, but let me make sure I'm not missing anything. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), which would mean that we sum over all possible \\(c\\) exponents. But that would give us 6 times the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384. But that would mean the coefficient is 384, which is a constant, but in reality, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is being multiplied by a polynomial in \\(c\\), so the coefficient is a polynomial. Therefore, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. Alternatively, maybe the problem is only concerned with the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) parts, and the \\(c\\) part is irrelevant, but that seems unlikely. So, perhaps the correct approach is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. Therefore, the answer is 120. But wait, to be thorough, let me consider both interpretations. If the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), then it's 6 * 64 = 384. If it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it's 120. But in the original problem, it's written as \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), and we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, perhaps the problem is only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), irrespective of the \\(c\\) terms, meaning that the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But that doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a coefficient, which is typically a scalar. Therefore, perhaps the intended interpretation is that we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. Alternatively, maybe the problem is written in such a way that it's just \\((a + b)^4\\) times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), and we're to consider the product as a polynomial in \\(a, b, c\\), and find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would involve summing over all possible \\(c\\) exponents. But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a coefficient, implying a scalar. Therefore, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. So, after considering both interpretations, I think the correct answer is 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is 120.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in calculating the sum of coefficients. When I set \\(c = 1\\), \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) becomes \\((1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of the coefficients is indeed 64. Therefore, if I multiply that by 6, I get 384. But that would be the case if we're considering the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times any power of \\(c\\). But if we're only considering the constant term in \\(c\\), then it's 120. So, perhaps the problem is expecting 384, but I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is written in a way that the entire expression is considered as a product, and the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the sum of the coefficients of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 384. But I'm a bit confused because the problem didn't specify anything about \\(c\\). Hmm.\n\nWait, maybe I should think of it differently. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, each term in the expansion would be of the form \\(a^kb^{4 - k} \\times c^m\\), where \\(k\\) ranges from 0 to 4, and \\(m\\) ranges such that the exponent of \\(c\\) is from \\(-6\\) to \\(6\\) in steps of 2. So, when we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), that corresponds to \\(k = 2\\), so the coefficient from the first part is 6, and then from the second part, we have \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), gives terms like \\(6a^2b^2c^m\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^m\\) would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^m\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), without specifying \\(c\\), which is a bit ambiguous. So, perhaps the intended interpretation is that we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. Alternatively, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), that would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), but that's not a single number, so that can't be the case. Therefore, the most reasonable interpretation is that we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. So, I think that's the correct answer.\n\nWait, to double-check, let me compute \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem and see what the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is. As I did before, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, when \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), \\(k = 3\\), and the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Then, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, so multiplying them gives 6 * 20 = 120. So, that's consistent. Therefore, I think the correct answer is 120.\n\nBut wait, let me also consider the alternative approach where I treat the entire expression as a product and see if the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 384. If I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = 64\\), as before. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 * 64 = 384, but that would be the case if we're considering the coefficient when \\(c = 1\\), which is the sum of all coefficients. But the problem isn't specifying that, so perhaps that's not the correct approach. Therefore, I think the correct answer is 120.\n\nWait, another way to think about it: if we're only concerned with the term \\(a^2b^2\\), then the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient would be 6 times each term in the expansion, meaning that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for a coefficient, which is a scalar, so that can't be the case. Therefore, the only way the coefficient is a scalar is if we're considering the term where \\(c^0\\) is involved. Therefore, the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120. So, I think that's the correct answer.\n\nWait, to sum up, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product is 6 * 20 = 120. So, the answer is 120.\n\nBut just to make sure, let me compute \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) fully. The expansion is:\n\n\\[\n\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n\\]\n\nSo, the terms are:\n\n- \\(k=0\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{0}c^{6} = 1 \\times c^6\\)\n- \\(k=1\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{1}c^{4} = 6c^4\\)\n- \\(k=2\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{2}c^{2} = 15c^2\\)\n- \\(k=3\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}c^{0} = 20\\)\n- \\(k=4\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{4}c^{-2} = 15c^{-2}\\)\n- \\(k=5\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{5}c^{-4} = 6c^{-4}\\)\n- \\(k=6\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{6}c^{-6} = 1c^{-6}\\)\n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is indeed 20. Therefore, when we multiply by \\(6a^2b^2\\), we get \\(6 \\times 20 a^2b^2c^0 = 120a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient is 120. So, I'm confident that the answer is 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break down the problem into two parts using the binomial theorem.\n\n1. **Expanding \\((a + b)^4\\):**\n   Using the binomial theorem, we have:\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\), so the coefficient is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\n   \\]\n\n2. **Expanding \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   Using the binomial theorem, we have:\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n   \\]\n   We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, which occurs when \\(6 - 2k = 0\\).

Wait, no, that's not correct. Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, each term will contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, but since \\(a^2b^2\\) is being multiplied by different powers of \\(c\\), the overall coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will actually be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Because each term in the second expansion has a coefficient, and when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each of those terms, you get a term like \\(a^2b^2 \\times \\text{(coefficient)} \\times c^{\\text{something}}\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). Wait, no, actually, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, which includes all powers of \\(c\\). But actually, no, because \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), so when you multiply it by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), you're effectively scaling \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that doesn't make sense because the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is a sum of terms, each with their own coefficients, and when you multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), you're just scaling it by each of those coefficients. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Because each term in the second expansion contributes a coefficient when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), so the total coefficient is the product of the two coefficients. Wait, no, that's not right. Let me think again. If I have \\((a + b)^4 = \\text{something}\\) and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = \\text{something else}\\), then the product is the sum over all terms in the first expansion multiplied by all terms in the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, each term contributes its coefficient to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 (from the first part) times the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Now, how do I find the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\)? Well, the sum of the coefficients in a polynomial is found by plugging in \\(c = 1\\). So, if I substitute \\(c = 1\\) into \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), I get \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 times 64, which is 384. Wait, but let me double-check that. So, the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the sum of coefficients from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. That seems right. Alternatively, another way to think about it is that when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each polynomial. But in this case, since \\(a^2b^2\\) is only present in the first polynomial, and we're multiplying by the entire second polynomial, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would indeed be the coefficient from the first polynomial times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial. So, I think that's the answer. Therefore, the coefficient is 384.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\):\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\n   \\]\n   So, the coefficient is 6.\n\n2. **Determine the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   The sum of coefficients is found by setting \\(c = 1\\):\n   \\[\n   \\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\n   \\]\n\n3. **Multiply the coefficients:**\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is:\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 64 = 384\n   \\]\n\n**Final Answer:** The coefficient is \\boxed{384}."

    "text": " Let me think. Wait, actually, when we multiply two expressions together, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression. But since we're only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), maybe the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) is the only part that contributes to \\(a^2b^2\\). But wait, that doesn't make sense because the other part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), might have a constant term, which when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\) would still give \\(a^2b^2\\) times that constant. So, perhaps I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) and then multiply it by the coefficient 6 from \\((a + b)^4\\). Let me check that. So, the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is the term where the exponents of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) cancel each other out. Let me expand that using the binomial theorem as well. So, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying each term, that's \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m} = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). Now, we want the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero because that's the constant term. So, set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(6 = 2m\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} c^{0} = \\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 20. Therefore, when we multiply the two expansions together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by 20 from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the second part). Let me compute that: 6 * 20 = 120. Wait, but I'm not sure if I'm missing something here. Let me double-check. So, the expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). When we expand this, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), the only term that will contribute to \\(a^2b^2\\) is when we multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part by the constant term from the second part. So, that makes sense. Therefore, the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120. Hmm, but wait, is that the case? Let me think again. Because when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second. So, if I have \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, and I multiply it by the constant term 20 in the second part, then yes, that gives me \\(20a^2b^2\\). But if there are other terms in the second expansion that also have \\(c^0\\), like maybe more than one term? No, because in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the only term with \\(c^0\\) is when \\(m = 3\\), which we found to be 20. So, that's the only term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), so when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), it just contributes 20 * 6. So, I think that's correct. Therefore, the coefficient should be 120. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the binomial coefficients. So, for \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) which is 6. For \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\) which is 20. Multiplying them gives 6 * 20 = 120. So, yeah, that seems right. I think that's the answer.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is found by first determining the coefficient in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplying it by the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20. Therefore, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}."

So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the entire second part, because there's no overlap in variables. Wait, that might not be correct. Let me think again. If I have \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), then each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) won't interfere with the terms involving \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because when you multiply, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part will just be multiplied by every term in the second part, but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), the other variables don't affect it. Wait, that doesn't seem quite right. Actually, when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficients multiply together. So, if I have a term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part and a term \\(c^k\\) from the second part, then the combined term would be \\(6a^2b^2c^k\\). But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), does that mean we need to sum over all possible \\(c\\) terms? Or is it that \\(a^2b^2\\) is just a term in the product, and the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of the second part? Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try a different approach. Since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are different variables, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't make sense because the coefficient should be a number, not a polynomial. Wait, no, actually, when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficients multiply, but in this case, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term is only from the first part, and the second part is entirely separate. So, perhaps the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is just 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), but the problem is just asking for a coefficient, which is a number. Hmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding the question. Wait, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, treating \\(c\\) as another variable. But that would be complicated because \\(c\\) could be any power. Alternatively, maybe the problem is considering \\(a^2b^2\\) as a term regardless of the power of \\(c\\), so the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems odd. Wait, no, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think again. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so when you expand the entire expression, how many times does \\(a^2b^2\\) appear, and what is the sum of the coefficients of those terms. But since \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by every term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, no, that's not correct. Each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, if I have \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part, it's multiplied by each term in the second part, which has terms like \\(c^6\\), \\(6c^4\\), \\(15c^2\\), \\(20\\), \\(15c^{-2}\\), \\(6c^{-4}\\), \\(c^{-6}\\). So, each of these will be multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times each of these coefficients. But wait, no, that's not right. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just 6, and then when you multiply by the second expansion, each term in the second expansion is multiplied by 6, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^6\\) would be 6, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^4\\) would be 6*6=36, and so on. But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not considering \\(c\\). Wait, but \\(a^2b^2\\) is just a term, so in the product, it's multiplied by each term in the second expansion, so the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of the second part. But that seems too broad. Alternatively, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Maybe the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, but that would require considering all possible powers of \\(c\\), which seems complicated. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only considering the terms where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out, i.e., \\(c^0\\), so that the term is just \\(a^2b^2\\). In that case, I would need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\) in the product. So, that would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Hmm, that makes sense. Because if we're looking for the term \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms, then the coefficient would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion. So, let me compute that. First, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem again, the expansion is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be 0, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\). So, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. So, going back, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\) in the entire product is 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120. Wait, but let me make sure I'm interpreting the problem correctly. The problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", without specifying anything about \\(c\\). So, perhaps I need to consider all possible terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any power of \\(c\\), and then the coefficient would be the sum of all those coefficients. But that would mean the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of the second part, which is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for a coefficient, which is a number, so perhaps I'm supposed to consider only the constant term, i.e., the term where \\(c\\) is raised to the 0 power. That makes sense because otherwise, the coefficient would be a polynomial, which doesn't seem right. So, I think the correct approach is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient is 120. Let me double-check my steps. First, I found the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6. Then, I considered that this term is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the entire expansion of the second part. But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and not considering \\(c\\), I think it's implied that we're looking for the term where \\(c\\) is raised to the 0 power, so the coefficient is 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion, which is 20, so 6*20=120. That seems correct. Alternatively, if I consider that the entire product is a polynomial in \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\), then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be a polynomial in \\(c\\), but the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, so I think the intended interpretation is to find the constant term with respect to \\(c\\), i.e., the term where \\(c^0\\) is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient is 120. I think that's the answer. So, putting it all together, the coefficient is 120. Wait, but just to make sure, let me think about it another way. If I expand both parts separately, then when I multiply them together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient from the first part times each term in the second part. But since we're only interested in \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of the second part. But that would make the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because coefficients are numerical. Therefore, I must have made a mistake in my initial approach. Wait, no, actually, in the product, each term is a product of a term from the first polynomial and a term from the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by each term from the second part, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), etc. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product isn't a single number but rather a sum over all coefficients from the second part, each multiplied by 6. However, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a bit ambiguous. It could mean the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120, or it could mean the sum of all coefficients of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for any \\(k\\), which would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. But the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), so \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, if the problem is asking for the sum of all coefficients of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), then it would be 6 * 64 = 384. But I think that's not what the problem is asking. It's more likely asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), but that's not a standard interpretation. Typically, when asked for the coefficient of a term, it's considering all variables. So, perhaps the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, which would require considering all possible powers of \\(c\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which seems complicated. Alternatively, maybe the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be 120. I think that's the most reasonable interpretation. So, I'll go with 120 as the coefficient. Therefore, the final answer is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6. Then, we consider the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20. Multiplying these together gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is 120, so \\boxed{120}."

When you have two separate expressions multiplied together, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each expression. But in this case, we're looking for a term that only involves \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), specifically \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from \\((a + b)^4\\), and it's multiplied by every term from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the question is asking for a numerical coefficient. Therefore, perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and the \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) part is just a multiplier, so the overall coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But again, that seems like the coefficient would be an expression, not a number.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let's try a different approach. Let's consider that the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). If I expand both parts separately, then multiply them together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be present in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) with coefficient 6, and it will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), so that would be \\((1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times 64, which is 384. Wait, is that correct?\n\nLet me check that again. The sum of the coefficients in a polynomial is found by substituting the variable with 1. So, for \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), substituting \\(c = 1\\) gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the sum of the coefficients is 64. So, if we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is 6 in \\((a + b)^4\\), and it's multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), then the total coefficient would be 6 times 64, which is 384. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 384.\n\nWait, but is that the right way to think about it? Because when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial, because each term in the second polynomial is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, yes, the coefficient would be 6 times 64, which is 384.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider that \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) expands to a sum of terms involving various powers of \\(c\\), but when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), each of those terms would contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. So, the coefficient would indeed be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 64, giving 384.\n\nWait, but another way to think about it is that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is just the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), because each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is being multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). So, yes, that would be 6 times 64, which is 384.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of it as the entire product being \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), so when you expand it, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term comes from \\((a + b)^4\\) as 6, and it's multiplied by every term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me make sure. Let's take a simpler example to test this idea. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^0\\) in \\((a + b)^2\\) is 1, and the sum of coefficients in \\((c + 1/c)^1\\) is (1 + 1) = 2. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^0\\) in the product would be 1 * 2 = 2. Let's check by expanding: \\((a + b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2\\), and \\((c + 1/c) = c + 1/c\\). Multiplying these together: \\(a^2(c + 1/c) + 2ab(c + 1/c) + b^2(c + 1/c)\\). The term \\(a^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) would be \\(c + 1/c\\), which is a sum of coefficients 1 + 1 = 2, so yes, the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) in the product is 2, which matches 1 * 2. So, that seems to confirm that the method is correct.\n\nTherefore, applying this to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 64, so the total coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). The sum of coefficients is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), so \\((1 + 1/1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). That's correct.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't miss anything. The problem is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, when you expand this, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from \\((a + b)^4\\), and it's multiplied by every term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, if I think about it as the coefficient being the product of the individual coefficients, but in this case, since we're looking for a term that only exists in one part, the coefficient is just the product of the coefficient from that part and the sum of coefficients from the other part.\n\nSo, I think that's the answer. The coefficient is 384.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{384}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break down the problem into two parts: expanding \\((a + b)^4\\) and considering the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\n1. **Expanding \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   We need the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2, which corresponds to \\(k = 2\\):\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} a^{2}b^{2} = 6 a^2b^2\n   \\]\n   So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\n2. **Considering the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   The sum of the coefficients in this expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\):\n   \\[\n   (1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\n   \\]\n\n3. **Combining the results:**\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the product of the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) and the sum of the coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 64 = 384\n   \\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\boxed{384}\\)."

So, when we expand \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) separately, each will have their own terms. Then, when we multiply them together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would come from the product of the coefficients of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and the constant term (if any) in the second part. Because if we have \\(a^2b^2\\) times any term involving \\(c\\), it would be \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or something, but since we only want \\(a^2b^2\\), we need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. So, in the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), I need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. Let me recall that in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term is given by \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, to find the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, we set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\). So, the coefficient for the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\), which is 20. Therefore, the constant term in the second part is 20. Now, going back to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be the product of the coefficient from the first part and the constant term from the second part. So, that's 6 (from \\(a^2b^2\\)) times 20 (the constant term). So, 6 * 20 = 120. Wait, is that right? Let me double-check. So, \\((a + b)^4\\) gives 6 for \\(a^2b^2\\), and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) gives 20 for the constant term. So, when we multiply these two expansions, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by the constant term, giving \\(6 * 20 = 120\\). So, the coefficient is 120. Hmm, that seems straightforward, but let me make sure I didn't miss anything. Another way to think about it is that when you multiply two expressions, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the sum of the products of coefficients where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2 and 2, respectively, and the exponents of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) multiply to give a constant term. But in this case, since we're only looking for \\(a^2b^2\\), the \\(c\\) terms must cancel out, which only happens in the constant term of the second expression. So, yeah, that should be correct. Therefore, the coefficient is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is found by considering the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\), where the term \\(a^2b^2\\) has a coefficient of 6, and the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, which is a product of two expansions. So, when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficients multiply as well. But in this case, \\((a + b)^4\\) is being multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), so each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But since we're only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), that term is independent of \\(c\\). So, actually, any term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) that has \\(c^0\\) (i.e., a constant term) will multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term, and the other terms would involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), which would make the entire term have \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), so they wouldn't contribute to \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, first, as I found earlier, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. Now, I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let's expand that using the binomial theorem. The expansion is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We want the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero because that's the constant term. So, set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\).

Wait, no, that's not correct. Let me clarify. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).

Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some \\(k\\), but no, the problem just says \\(a^2b^2\\), so maybe it's considering the entire expression, including the \\(c\\) terms.

But wait, no, because each term in \\((c + 1/c)^6\\) is a separate term, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients from \\((c + 1/c)^6\\). Because when you multiply, each term in \\((c + 1/c)^6\\) is a coefficient times some power of \\(c\\), so when you multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), each of those terms becomes a coefficient times \\(a^2b^2c^k\\). So, if we're just looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\), we would need to sum all the coefficients from \\((c + 1/c)^6\\), because each of those would pair with \\(a^2b^2\\) to give a term with \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), and the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without considering \\(c\\) would be the sum of all those coefficients. Wait, but that might not be correct because the problem might be asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, meaning we can treat the \\((c + 1/c)^6\\) as a single entity. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, which would include all possible \\(c\\) terms, but since the problem doesn't specify any \\(c\\) terms, maybe we can treat the \\((c + 1/c)^6\\) as a constant.

So, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by any power of \\(c\\), but the problem statement just says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", so I'm a bit confused. Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me try to think differently. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when we expand this, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\) and is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't make sense because the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) isn't a single number. So, perhaps I need to consider that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) has a coefficient, and when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), each of those coefficients contributes to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. So, if I can find the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), then multiply that by the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\), that should give me the desired coefficient. So, how do I find the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)? Well, the sum of coefficients in a polynomial is found by setting all variables to 1. So, if I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) becomes \\((1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 (from \\((a + b)^4\\)) multiplied by 64, which is 6 * 64 = 384. Wait, is that correct? Let me check again. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 64. So, when you multiply these together, each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is a coefficient, and when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), each of those coefficients contributes to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. Therefore, the total coefficient would be 6 * 64 = 384. Hmm, that seems plausible, but I'm not entirely sure. Let me think of another approach. Alternatively, maybe I should expand both parts separately and then look for the coefficient. So, first, \\((a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6. Now, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) can be expanded using the binomial theorem as well. So, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, the expansion is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). Now, when we multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which are \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\) for \\(k = 0\\) to \\(6\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) (which is 6) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). As I calculated earlier, the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 384. Wait, but let me make sure. Alternatively, maybe I'm supposed to consider that when multiplying, the terms involving \\(c\\) are separate, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that doesn't make sense because the expansion has multiple terms. So, perhaps the correct approach is that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 64, giving 384. Alternatively, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, then it's 6 times 64, which is 384. But wait, another thought: perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, which would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the other part. Because each term in the other part is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), so the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the other part. So, that would be 6 * 64 = 384. Therefore, I think that's the answer. So, putting it all together, the coefficient is 384. But just to make sure, let me check my reasoning again. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 64. Therefore, when multiplying these two polynomials, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 * 64 = 384. Yeah, that makes sense. So, I think the final answer is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is found using the binomial theorem, which gives 6. The sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is calculated by setting \\(c = 1\\), resulting in 64. Multiplying these together gives the final coefficient as \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n\\boxed{384}"

    "text": " Hmm, wait, no, because when you multiply two expressions together, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression. But in this case, the first part is \\((a + b)^4\\) and the second part is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, actually, the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms are separate from the \\(c\\) terms. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But wait, that doesn't make sense because when you multiply two polynomials, each term from the first polynomial is multiplied by each term from the second. However, since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are in one part and \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) are in the other, the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from the terms involving \\(c\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the product of the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from \\((a + b)^4\\) and the constant term from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Because if I multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by a term involving \\(c\\), it would give me a term like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or something, which isn't just \\(a^2b^2\\). So, to get the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and then multiply it by the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). That makes sense because when you multiply the two expressions together, the constant term in the second expression will multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term, leaving it as \\(a^2b^2\\), while any other terms would involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\). So, let me break it down into two parts. First, I've already found that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. Now, I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). The constant term would be the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero because \\(c^0 = 1\\). So, let's expand \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem. The expansion is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(1/c\\right)^k\\). Simplifying each term, that's \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} c^{-k}\\) which is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, each term has an exponent of \\(6 - 2k\\). We need the term where the exponent is zero, so we set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is when \\(k = 3\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20. Now, putting it all together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the two coefficients I found. That is, 6 (from the \\(a^2b^2\\) term) multiplied by 20 (the constant term from the \\(c\\) expression). So, 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120. Wait, but let me double-check to make sure I didn't make a mistake. So, the first part: \\((a + b)^4\\), coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) which is 6. Then, the second part: \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), constant term is when \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), so \\(k = 3\\), and \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying 6 and 20 gives 120. That seems correct. So, I think that's the answer.\n\nWait, but hold on a second. Maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again. When you multiply two expressions together, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6a^2b^2. Then, when you multiply this by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), you get terms like 6a^2b^2c^6, 6a^2b^2c^4, etc. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would only be present if there's a term in the second expression that is a constant (i.e., \\(c^0\\)), so that when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), it remains \\(a^2b^2\\). So, yes, I think my initial approach is correct. So, the constant term in the second expression is 20, so 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient is 120. I think that's right. Maybe to be thorough, I can think of it another way. Let me consider the entire product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are different variables, the exponents multiply across the terms. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) can only come from multiplying \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part by the constant term from the second part, because any other term would introduce a power of \\(c\\), which isn't present in \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient is indeed 6 * 20 = 120. So, I'm confident that the coefficient is 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break down the problem into two parts using the binomial theorem.\n\nFirst, consider the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\). Using the binomial theorem, we have:\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n\\]\nWe need the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2. This corresponds to \\(k = 2\\), so the coefficient is:\n\\[\n\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\n\\]\n\nNext, consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem, we have:\n\\[\n\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n\\]\nWe need the constant term, which occurs when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. Setting \\(6 - 2k = 0\\) gives \\(k = 3\\). The coefficient is:\n\\[\n\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\n\\]\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, we multiply the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) by the constant term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):\n\\[\n6 \\times 20 = 120\n\\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

Let me try to break it down.\n\nSo, the expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When we expand this, each term from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term from the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term from the second part, which are of the form \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\\).

Now, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but it's not specifying any particular power of \\(c\\). So, does that mean we're just looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms? Or perhaps, is the problem asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times any power of \\(c\\), meaning that the coefficient would be the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by 6? Wait, that doesn't seem right. Maybe I'm misunderstanding the question.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, considering all possible terms, but since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), maybe the coefficient is just 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) has a coefficient, and when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), those coefficients would contribute to the overall coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product.\n\nBut wait, actually, when you multiply two expressions together, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each factor. But in this case, \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term from the first factor, and each term from the second factor is a term involving \\(c\\). So, when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second factor, you get terms like \\(a^2b^2c^{6 - 2k}\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would actually be the sum of all coefficients from the second factor, because each term in the second factor, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), contributes to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^{6 - 2k}\\). But the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), without any restriction on the power of \\(c\\). So, perhaps we're supposed to consider all possible powers of \\(c\\), meaning that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the sum of all the coefficients from the second factor, each multiplied by 6.\n\nWait, let me think again. If the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then that coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because each term in the second factor is a coefficient times some power of \\(c\\), and when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), each of those coefficients contributes to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, but with different powers of \\(c\\). So, if we're just interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), irrespective of the \\(c\\) terms, then it's the sum of all the coefficients from the second factor multiplied by 6.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let's see: perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion of the entire product, but without considering the \\(c\\) terms. So, maybe the \\(c\\) terms are separate, and when you multiply, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term is multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\). So, if I substitute \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the sum of all coefficients in the second factor is 64. So, then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times 64, which is 384. But wait, that seems too large. Let me check that again.\n\nWait, no, perhaps that's not correct. Because when you set \\(c = 1\\), you get the sum of all coefficients, which is 64. So, if we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, it's the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the sum of all coefficients from the second part, which is 64. So, 6 * 64 = 384. But that seems high. Let me see if that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, considering that the product includes terms with \\(c\\), but the problem is only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, in that case, the coefficient would indeed be 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second factor, which is 64, giving 384.\n\nBut let me think again. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, but only considering terms where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out, i.e., where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. So, that would mean finding the term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, and then multiplying that by 6. Because if we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), without any \\(c\\) terms, then that would correspond to the term where \\(c^0\\), which is the constant term in the second factor.\n\nSo, let me calculate the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem again, the general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - k}\\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\\). We want the exponent of \\(c\\) to be zero, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\). So, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\), which is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the second part), giving 120.\n\nWait, but now I'm confused because earlier I thought the sum of all coefficients is 64, but now I'm getting 20 as the constant term. So, which one is correct?\n\nI think I need to clarify the problem. The problem says: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, when it says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", it's referring to the term that has \\(a^2b^2\\) and any power of \\(c\\). So, in other words, in the entire expansion, the coefficient would be the sum of all coefficients where the term is \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for any integer \\(k\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient from the first part (which is 6) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients from the second part, which is 64. So, 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nBut wait, that contradicts my earlier thought where I considered only the constant term. So, maybe I need to figure out whether the problem wants the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\) or only the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\).\n\nLooking back at the problem statement: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" It doesn't specify any power of \\(c\\), so I think it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second factor, which is 64, giving 384.\n\nBut let me check this again. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think of it differently. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). If I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), then in the first part, it's 6. Now, in the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, when I multiply these together, each term in the product will be \\(6 \\times \\dbinom{6}{k} a^2b^2c^{6 - 2k}\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the sum of all \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}\\) for \\(k\\) from 0 to 6. But the sum of all \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}\\) is \\(2^6 = 64\\). So, 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but that would mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 384, considering all possible powers of \\(c\\). But if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then that's correct. However, if it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it's different.\n\nWait, perhaps I should think about it as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, which would include all possible powers of \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient is indeed 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nBut wait, let me test this with a smaller exponent to see if this approach is correct. Suppose instead of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), it was \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^1\\). Then, the expansion is \\(c + 1/c\\). The sum of the coefficients would be 1 + 1 = 2. So, if I have \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)\\), and I want the coefficient of \\(a^2b^0\\), which is the same as \\(a^2\\), then that would be \\(\\dbinom{2}{2} = 1\\) multiplied by the sum of coefficients in \\((c + 1/c)\\), which is 2, so 1 * 2 = 2. But wait, if I expand \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)\\), the terms would be \\(a^2c\\), \\(a^2 \\times 1/c\\), \\(2ab c\\), \\(2ab \\times 1/c\\), \\(b^2c\\), and \\(b^2 \\times 1/c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) would be 1 (from \\(a^2c\\)) + 1 (from \\(a^2 \\times 1/c\\)) = 2, which matches the calculation. So, in that case, the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) is indeed 2, which is 1 (from the first part) times 2 (sum of coefficients in the second part). So, that seems correct.\n\nSimilarly, in our original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times 64, which is 384. But wait, let me check that again because in the smaller example, the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) was 2, which is 1 * 2, where 1 is the coefficient from the first part and 2 is the sum of coefficients from the second part. So, applying that logic, in our problem, the coefficient from the first part is 6, and the sum of coefficients from the second part is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should think about the problem differently. Let me consider that when you have two independent variables, \\(a, b\\) and \\(c\\), the expansion of the product will have terms that are products of terms from each expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first part, and any term from the second part, which is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), will be multiplied by it. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Therefore, 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nBut let me check this with another example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^1 \\times (c + 1/c)^2\\). The expansion of the first part is \\(a + b\\), so the coefficient of \\(a\\) is 1. The expansion of the second part is \\(c^2 + 2c \\times 1/c + (1/c)^2 = c^2 + 2 + 1/c^2\\). The sum of coefficients here is 1 + 2 + 1 = 4. So, the coefficient of \\(a\\) in the product would be 1 * 4 = 4. Let's see: the product is \\((a + b)(c^2 + 2 + 1/c^2)\\). The terms involving \\(a\\) would be \\(a c^2\\), \\(2a\\), and \\(a \\times 1/c^2\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a\\) is 1 (from \\(a c^2\\)) + 2 (from \\(2a\\)) + 1 (from \\(a \\times 1/c^2\\)) = 4, which matches the calculation. So, that seems correct.\n\nTherefore, applying this logic to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 * 64 = 384. So, I think that's the answer.\n\nWait, but another way to think about it is that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the product of the coefficients of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Since the second part is independent of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), each term in the second part contributes its coefficient to every term in the first part. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient from the first part times the sum of coefficients from the second part.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it again. Let me try to think of it as the product of two separate expansions. So, the first expansion gives \\(a^2b^2\\) with coefficient 6, and the second expansion gives any term, each with its own coefficient. So, when you multiply them together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times any term from the second expansion is 6 times that term's coefficient. Therefore, the total coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, giving 384.\n\nWait, but in the problem statement, it's just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so that would include all possible powers of \\(c\\). So, the answer is 384.\n\nBut let me check again with the smaller example to be sure. If I have \\((a + b)^1 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\), then the expansion is \\((a + b)(c + 1/c)\\). The coefficient of \\(a\\) is 1, and the sum of coefficients in the second part is 2 (1 for \\(c\\) and 1 for \\(1/c\\)). So, the coefficient of \\(a\\) in the product is 1 * 2 = 2. Let's see: the product is \\(a c + a \\times 1/c + b c + b \\times 1/c\\). The terms with \\(a\\) are \\(a c\\) and \\(a \\times 1/c\\), so their coefficients are 1 and 1, adding up to 2, which is correct. So, yes, the approach is correct.\n\nTherefore, applying this to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times 64, which is 384.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit unsure because sometimes when you have multiple variables, you might have to consider cross terms, but in this case, since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), their coefficients are independent. So, I think the approach is correct.\n\nWait, but another way to think about it is that when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a term in the product is the sum of the products of coefficients of terms whose variables multiply to give that term. In this case, since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part. So, 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nSo, after all this thinking, I believe the coefficient is 384. But let me just recap to make sure I didn't miss anything.\n\nFirst, expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n\nNext, consider \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The sum of all coefficients in this expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), giving \\(2^6 = 64\\).\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, the final answer is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by calculating the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplying it by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 64. Thus, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n$\\boxed{384}$"

But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), maybe that part just gets multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, that would mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is actually 6 times the sum of all terms in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't seem right because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term without \\(c\\), so maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again. Perhaps I need to consider that the entire expression is a product, so when I expand it, each term will be a product of a term from \\((a + b)^4\\) and a term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), that means we need to find the term in \\((a + b)^4\\) that is \\(a^2b^2\\) and then multiply it by the constant term (the term without \\(c\\)) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because when we multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by the constant term, it will remain \\(a^2b^2\\), and that's the term we're interested in. If we multiplied \\(a^2b^2\\) by a term involving \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), it would become something like \\(a^2b^2c\\) or \\(a^2b^2/c\\), which isn't \\(a^2b^2\\) anymore. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). That makes sense. So, first, I found that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. Now, I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me figure that out. Again, using the binomial theorem, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying that, each term becomes \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\times c^{-m} = \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the exponent of \\(c\\) in each term is \\(6 - 2m\\). We need the term where the exponent is 0, because that's the constant term. So, set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which gives \\(m = 3\\). So, the constant term is when \\(m = 3\\), and the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the second part). So, 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient is 120. Wait, let me double-check to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. So, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed when \\(k = 2\\), giving 6. In \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the constant term is when \\(m = 3\\), giving 20. Multiplying them together gives 120. That seems correct.

Wait, that might be more complicated than I thought. Let me think again. So, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When we expand this, every term in the expansion will be of the form (coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times coefficient from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)) multiplied by \\(a^k b^{4 - k} c^m\\) or something like that.

But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) part, does that mean we can just take the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and multiply it by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)? But that doesn't make sense because the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is a sum of terms involving different powers of \\(c\\), and we're supposed to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\). Wait, no, that's not correct. Actually, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by each term in the other expansion, but since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), the \\(c\\) part can be anything, right? So, the coefficient would actually be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that doesn't sound right either because each term in the product would have both \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) and \\(c\\) parts. Maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try another approach. Since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), that means in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the \\(c\\) terms must cancel out. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would come from multiplying \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) by a term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) that is \\(c^0\\), i.e., a constant term. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is equal to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I need to find both coefficients and then multiply them together. I've already found that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. Now, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let's work on that. Using the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, we need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be 0. That is, \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(6 = 2k\\) so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Let me compute that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Now, going back to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the two coefficients I found: 6 (from \\(a^2b^2\\)) and 20 (from \\(c^0\\)). So, 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120. Wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake here. So, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Then, in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the constant term is when the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, which happens when \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), so \\(k = 3\\), and the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, when I multiply these two together, it's 6 * 20 = 120. That seems correct. So, the final answer should be 120. But just to be thorough, let me think if there's another way to approach this problem. Alternatively, I could consider that the entire expression is a product of two expansions, and when you multiply them, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the product of the coefficients of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and the constant term in the second part, which is what I did. So, I think that's correct. Therefore, the coefficient is 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break down the problem into two parts using the binomial theorem.\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   We need the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which corresponds to \\(k = 2\\):\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\n   \\]\n\n2. **Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n   \\]\n   We need the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) (the constant term), which occurs when \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), so \\(k = 3\\):\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\n   \\]\n\n3. **Multiply the coefficients:**\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficients found:\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 20 = 120\n   \\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

But that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion, which doesn't make sense because the coefficient should be a number, not a polynomial. Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).

So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, is that right? Because when you multiply, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Alternatively, maybe I can think of it as the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but since we're only considering the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present, the \\(c\\) terms don't matter. So, perhaps the coefficient is just the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).

So, does that mean the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\)? But wait, that seems too straightforward. Let me check. Alternatively, maybe I'm supposed to consider that the entire expression is a product, and when you take the product, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, yes, that would be 6 times 64, which is 384. But I want to make sure. Let me think again. When you have two polynomials multiplied together, say \\(P(a, b) \\times Q(c)\\), the coefficient of a term like \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(P(a, b)\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(Q(c)\\), because each term in \\(Q(c)\\) is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), so the total coefficient is the original coefficient times the sum of coefficients in \\(Q(c)\\). So, yes, I think that's correct. Alternatively, if I expand \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) separately, and then multiply them, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be present in the first expansion with coefficient 6, and then each of the terms from the second expansion will be multiplied by this 6. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 6 times 64, which is 384. So, I think that's the answer. But let me double-check. Alternatively, maybe I'm supposed to consider that the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is only one part, and the other part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), so the entire coefficient would be 6 times the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but since we're just looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and not any specific term in \\(c\\), maybe it's just 6 times the entire expansion, but that doesn't make sense because the coefficient should be a single number. So, perhaps the correct approach is that since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term that exists in \\((a + b)^4\\) and when multiplied by any term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), it will still be \\(a^2b^2\\) times some power of \\(c\\).

Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it, and the answer is just 6, but that seems too simple.

So, I think that's the correct answer. Let me just recap: Coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(2^6 = 64\\). So, 6 times 64 is 384.

Wait, no, actually, when you multiply two expressions, the coefficients multiply. So, for the term \\(a^2b^2\\), it will be multiplied by each term in the other expansion. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), maybe the \\(c\\) terms will just contribute their coefficients, and the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will be multiplied by each term in the other expansion, so the total coefficient will be 6 (from \\(a^2b^2\\)) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that might not be accurate because each term in the product would have different powers of \\(c\\), but since we're only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), we need to sum all the coefficients from the \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) expansion because each term in that expansion, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), would contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. So, let me break it down. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. Then, the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is a sum of terms, each of which is of the form \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(1/c\\right)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, the coefficient of each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}\\), and the variable part is \\(c^{6 - 2k}\\). Now, when we multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in the product will be a combination of a term from \\((a + b)^4\\) and a term from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But since we're only interested in the terms where the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) parts are \\(a^2b^2\\), the \\(c\\) part can be anything because the problem doesn't specify any condition on \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Wait, that makes sense because when you multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), each term in the \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) expansion would contribute its own coefficient to the product term \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) power. So, the total coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Now, the sum of all coefficients in a polynomial is found by setting all variables to 1. So, in this case, setting \\(c = 1\\), the sum would be \\(\\left(1 + 1/1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times 64, which is 384. Wait, but let me check that again. Is that correct? Because when you expand \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term has a coefficient \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}\\) and a variable part \\(c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, when you multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), each term would contribute \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}\\) to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^{6 - 2k}\\). But since we're only interested in \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) power, we need to sum all the coefficients from the \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) expansion. So, the sum is indeed 64, so the total coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Since we're just looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\), then yes, the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the other expansion, which is 64, giving 384. So, the final answer should be 384. Let me just verify that. Another way to think about it: the product is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\) with coefficient 6, and it's multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Since we're not restricting \\(c\\), all those terms contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so we have to sum all the coefficients from the \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) expansion, which is 64, and then multiply by 6. So, yes, 6 * 64 is 384. Therefore, the coefficient is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.

    "text": " Let me think. Wait, no, actually, because the expression is a product of two separate binomial expansions. So, when you multiply them together, each term in the first expansion will multiply each term in the second expansion. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), we can consider that any terms involving \\(c\\) will just contribute a factor, but since we're looking for a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), maybe the \\(c\\) part has to cancel out. Wait, but the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so perhaps the \\(c\\) part can be any term, but since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), maybe I don't need to worry about the \\(c\\) terms at all. Wait, that doesn't make sense because the entire expression is a product, so the \\(a^2b^2\\) term would be multiplied by some term from the second expansion, which involves \\(c\\). So, perhaps I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion. Because \\(c^0\\) is 1, so that would just contribute a constant factor. So, in other words, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, that seems like a plan. So, let me first confirm that approach. So, in the product of two expressions, the coefficient of a specific term (like \\(a^2b^2\\)) would be the product of the coefficient of that term in the first expression and the coefficient of the term in the second expression that doesn't affect the variables we're considering. Since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the term from the second expression must be the one that is a constant, i.e., \\(c^0\\), so that when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), it remains \\(a^2b^2\\). So, that makes sense. Therefore, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me figure that out. So, using the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying each term, that's \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m} = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, each term has an exponent of \\(6 - 2m\\). We want the term where the exponent is 0, so we set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). So, the term where \\(m = 3\\) is the constant term. So, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficients from each part, which are 6 and 20. So, 6 multiplied by 20 is 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let me double-check each step. First, for \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Correct. Then, for \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), expanding using the binomial theorem, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, to get the term where the exponent is 0, \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), so \\(m = 3\\), and the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Correct. Then, since the two parts are multiplied together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 times 20, which is 120. So, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe I can think of it as the entire expression being the product of two expansions, so when you multiply them, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the sum over all possible products where the exponents add up to \\(a^2b^2\\). But since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the only way that can happen is if the term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is the constant term, so that when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), it remains \\(a^2b^2\\). So, that reinforces that the coefficient is 6 times 20, which is 120. Therefore, I think that's the answer. Wait, but just to make sure, maybe I can try a different approach. Let's consider the entire expression: \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). If I expand both parts separately and then multiply them, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will come from the first part, and it will be multiplied by every term from the second part. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), that means we need to find all terms in the product that result in \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). So, that would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part. So, that again gives 6 times 20, which is 120. So, yes, that seems consistent. Alternatively, maybe I can think of the entire expression as a product, and use generating functions or something, but I think the approach I took is solid. So, I think the coefficient is 120. Therefore, the final answer is 120. Wait, but just to make sure, let me compute \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) again. 4 choose 2 is (4\u00d73)/(2\u00d71) = 6. Correct. And 6 choose 3 is (6\u00d75\u00d74)/(3\u00d72\u00d71) = 20. Correct. So, 6\u00d720 is 120. So, yeah, that's the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression. Therefore, I think I'm confident that the answer is 120.\n\nWait, but wait a second, maybe I'm missing something. Let me think again. The problem is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, when you expand this, each term is of the form \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}a^{4 - k}b^k \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(4 - k = 2\\), so \\(k = 2\\), giving \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Then, the term \\(c^{6 - 2m}\\) must be \\(c^0\\), so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), so \\(m = 3\\), giving \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, the coefficient is 6\u00d720=120. So, that's correct. Alternatively, if I were to write out the entire expansion, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term would be 6 times the \\(c^0\\) term from the second expansion, which is 20, so 6\u00d720=120. So, yeah, that seems right. I think I've got it.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break down the problem into two parts using the binomial theorem.\n\n1. **Expanding \\((a + b)^4\\):**\n   Using the binomial theorem, the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is given by:\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   We need the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2, which corresponds to \\(k = 2\\).

Let me read the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" Hmm, so perhaps the question is just looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, but since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), the coefficient would be the same as in \\((a + b)^4\\) because the other part doesn't affect \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). Wait, but that seems too straightforward. Let me think again. Alternatively, maybe the problem is expecting me to consider the entire expansion, including the \\(c\\) terms, but since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient would just be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).

But wait, that doesn't sound right because each term in the expansion would have a different power of \\(c\\), so when you collect like terms, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that can't be correct because each term would have a different power of \\(c\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is independent of \\(c\\), maybe it's just the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).

Wait, but that would be if we were collecting all terms, but I think that's not the case here. Let me try to clarify. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when you multiply these two expressions together, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by every term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) where \\(k\\) ranges from, say, -6 to +6. But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). Wait, that can't be right because \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term on its own, so when multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), it becomes \\(a^2b^2 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which would be a sum of terms each involving \\(c^k\\). But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), perhaps we're only supposed to consider the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because otherwise, \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by different powers of \\(c\\), and we can't have a single coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) across different powers of \\(c\\). Hmm, this is confusing. Maybe I need to think differently. Wait, perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, in other words, when you multiply the two expressions, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will be multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that would be the case if we were collecting all the \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) terms, but the problem is only asking for \\(a^2b^2\\), so perhaps we're supposed to consider that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion, but since the problem is written as a single expression, maybe the variables are independent, and the coefficient is just the product of the coefficients from each part. Wait, no, that doesn't make sense because \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is multiplied by \\((a + b)^4\\), so when you expand the entire product, each term will be a product of a term from \\((a + b)^4\\) and a term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term without \\(c\\), that would mean that the coefficient is the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) contributes a coefficient, and when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), they become terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), but the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(k\\) would be the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) multiplied by the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\). Wait, but that seems off because the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so maybe we're supposed to treat the entire expression as a product and find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then considering that the rest of the expression doesn't affect \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), so the coefficient remains 6. But that seems too simple, and I feel like I'm missing something. Let me try another approach. Let me think of the entire expression as a product of two separate expansions. So, \\((a + b)^4\\) is one part, and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is another. When you multiply them together, each term from the first expansion is multiplied by each term from the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion is multiplied by every term in the second expansion, which has terms like \\(c^6, 6c^4, 15c^2, 20, 15c^{-2}, 6c^{-4}, c^{-6}\\). So, when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each of these, you get terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6, 6a^2b^2c^4, 15a^2b^2c^2, 20a^2b^2, 15a^2b^2c^{-2}, 6a^2b^2c^{-4}, a^2b^2c^{-6}\\). So, in the entire product, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Wait, but the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, does that mean we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\)? But that would imply that we're summing over all possible coefficients from the \\(c\\) terms. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me calculate that. First, as before, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. Now, the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\). So, plugging \\(c = 1\\) into \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 64. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 * 64 = 384. But wait, that seems high. Let me check if that's correct. Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and since the other part doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), the coefficient remains 6. But that doesn't seem right because when you multiply by the other expression, the coefficients could change. Wait, no, because when you multiply by a constant, the coefficients scale by that constant. But in this case, the other expression isn't a constant; it's another expansion. So, perhaps each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, that would be 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me try to think differently. Perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, without considering the \\(c\\) terms. In that case, since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be the same as in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, because the other part doesn't affect \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). But that seems contradictory because when you multiply by another expression, it's not just scaling by a constant; it's multiplying by an entire polynomial, so the coefficients would change. Wait, but in reality, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is being multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384. But wait, that seems like a lot. Let me confirm. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, meaning that we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which would indeed be 6 times 64, which is 384. But let me think again. When you have two polynomials multiplied together, the coefficient of a specific term in one polynomial is multiplied by the entire other polynomial. So, in this case, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by every term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(6a^2b^2c^4\\), etc. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would actually be the sum of all the coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) multiplied by 6, because each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) contributes a coefficient when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is indeed 64, as calculated before by setting \\(c = 1\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 * 64 = 384. Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, perhaps I can think of it as the coefficient being 6 times the sum of the coefficients of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 64, so 6*64=384. Yeah, that makes sense. So, the final answer should be 384.\n\nWait, but let me check this again because I might have made a mistake in understanding the problem. Let me rephrase: The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when we expand this product, each term will be a product of a term from \\((a + b)^4\\) and a term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by every term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which has terms like \\(c^6\\), \\(6c^4\\), \\(15c^2\\), \\(20\\), \\(15c^{-2}\\), \\(6c^{-4}\\), \\(c^{-6}\\). So, when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each of these, you get terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(6a^2b^2c^4\\), etc. Now, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but in the entire product, \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by various powers of \\(c\\). So, if we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), that would mean we're summing over all possible coefficients from the \\(c\\) terms. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by substituting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). Therefore, the final answer is 384. Wait, but let me make sure that this is correct. Alternatively, maybe I'm supposed to consider that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is only the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because otherwise, we wouldn't have a term with just \\(a^2b^2\\); we'd have \\(a^2b^2c^k\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\), which would mean that we're considering all terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present, regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would indeed be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 64, giving 384. Alternatively, if the problem had asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then we would have only considered the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20, and then multiplied by 6, giving 120. But since the problem is just asking for \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\), the coefficient is 384. So, I think that's the correct approach.\n\nWait, but let me think again. When you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial, which includes terms with \\(c^6, c^4, c^2, 1, c^{-2}, c^{-4}, c^{-6}\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial. Because each term in the second polynomial contributes a coefficient when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the sum of the coefficients in the second polynomial is indeed 64, so 6*64=384. So, I think that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, if I were to write the entire product as \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient, not the variable part, the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by 64, which is 384. Therefore, the answer is 384.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because sometimes when you have multiple variables, you have to consider the cross terms, but in this case, since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), their coefficients don't interfere. So, I think the approach is correct.\n\nTo sum up, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 64, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6*64=384.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{384}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break down the problem into two parts:\n\n1. **Expanding \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   We need the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2, which corresponds to \\(k = 2\\). The coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\n   \\]\n\n2. **Considering the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   The sum of all coefficients in this expansion can be found by setting \\(c = 1\\):\n   \\[\n   \\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\n   \\]\n\n3. **Combining the results:**\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is the product of the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) and the sum of the coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 64 = 384\n   \\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{384}\\)."

    "text": " Wait, no, actually, when you multiply two expressions together, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), that term must come from the product of the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in \\((a + b)^4\\) and the constant term (the term with \\(c^0\\)) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because if I multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by any other term from the second expression that has \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), it would result in a term that includes \\(c\\), which isn't what we want. So, I think I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me figure that out. Again, using the binomial theorem, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying that, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m} = \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the exponent of \\(c\\) in each term is \\(6 - 2m\\). We want the term where the exponent is 0 because that's the constant term. So, set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which gives \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20. Now, going back to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be the product of the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) and the constant term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, that's \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120. Let me double-check to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. So, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) has a coefficient of 6, which seems right because \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Then, in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the constant term is when the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, which occurs at \\(m = 3\\), giving \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying those together gives 6 * 20 = 120. That seems correct. I don't think I missed anything here. So, I'm confident that the coefficient is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Multiplying these together gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\boxed{120}"
