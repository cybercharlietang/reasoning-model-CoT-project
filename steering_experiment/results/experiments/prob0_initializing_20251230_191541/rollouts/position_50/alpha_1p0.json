    "text": " First, for \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). So, 4 choose 2 is (4\u00d73)/(2\u00d71) = 6. That's correct. For \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is when the exponent is 0. So, we have \\(c^{6 - m} \\times (1/c)^m = c^{6 - 2m}\\). Setting that equal to \\(c^0\\), so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which gives \\(m = 3\\). Then, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). That's correct too. So, 6 times 20 is indeed 120. So, I think that's the right answer. Just to make sure, maybe I can think of another way to approach this problem. Alternatively, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). When expanding, each term is of the form \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}a^{4 - k}b^k \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - m}(1/c)^m\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would require \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). So, that's the same as before, giving a coefficient of 6. Then, for the \\(c\\) terms, we need \\(6 - m - m = 0\\), which is \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), so \\(m = 3\\), giving a coefficient of 20. So, again, multiplying 6 and 20 gives 120. Yep, that seems consistent. So, I think the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is found by considering the expansion of each part separately and then multiplying the relevant coefficients. \n\n1.
