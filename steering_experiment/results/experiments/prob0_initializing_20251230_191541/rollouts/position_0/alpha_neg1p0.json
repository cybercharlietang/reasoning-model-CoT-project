    "text": " Hmm, okay. Let me try to figure this out step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that when you have an expression like \\((a + b)^n\\), the coefficients of the terms can be found using the binomial theorem. The binomial theorem states that \\((a + b)^n = \\sum_{k=0}^{n} \\binom{n}{k} a^{n - k}b^{k}\\). So, maybe I can apply that here.\n\nLooking at the given expression, it's \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Since these are multiplied together, I think the terms from each expansion will multiply each other. But I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). That means I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), and then see how it interacts with the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nWait, but actually, since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are variables separate from \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), right? Because when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficients multiply when the variables are the same. But in this case, \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) don't appear in the second part, so maybe the coefficient is just the coefficient from the first part times 1, since the second part doesn't affect \\(a\\) and \\(b\\).\n\nWait, no, that doesn't seem right. Let me think again. When you multiply two expressions, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression. So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I need to find all the terms in the product where the variables are \\(a^2b^2\\), and then sum their coefficients.\n\nBut in the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), there are no \\(a\\) or \\(b\\) terms. So, when I multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part by any term from the second part, it will just be \\(a^2b^2\\) times something involving \\(c\\). But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the other variables, I think I just need to consider the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and then multiply it by the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nWait, that might not be correct either. Let me clarify. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But actually, since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will only come from the terms where the first part contributes \\(a^2b^2\\) and the second part contributes any term, but since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) don't appear in the second part, the coefficient will just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nWait, but that doesn't seem right because when you multiply two expressions, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the sum of all coefficients in the second part. But I'm not sure if that's the case. Let me think about it differently.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should expand both expressions separately and then find the coefficient. So, first, let's find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\).\n\nUsing the binomial theorem, \\((a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\binom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^{k}\\). So, the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) occurs is when \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). So, the coefficient is \\(\\binom{4}{2}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\binom{4}{2} = 6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\nNow, the second part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I need to find its expansion, but since the problem is only about \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), perhaps the coefficient I'm looking for is just 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second expression. But wait, that's not correct because the second expression has terms with \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), which are separate variables. So, when I multiply the two expressions, each term in the first will be multiplied by each term in the second, but since the variables are different, the only terms that contribute to \\(a^2b^2\\) are those where the first part is \\(a^2b^2\\) and the second part is any term, regardless of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part.\n\nWait, but that's not quite right. Let me think again. The entire product is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, each term in the expansion will be of the form \\(a^{k}b^{4 - k} \\times c^{m} \\times \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^{6 - m}\\), which simplifies to \\(a^{k}b^{4 - k}c^{m - (6 - m)} = a^{k}b^{4 - k}c^{2m - 6}\\).\n\nBut the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so we need \\(k = 2\\) and \\(4 - k = 2\\), which is already satisfied. So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because for each term in the first part, it's multiplied by every term in the second part, but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), it's just the product of the coefficients.\n\nWait, but that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expression. But the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) can be found by setting \\(c = 1\\), because substituting \\(c = 1\\) gives \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\).\n\nSo, the sum of all coefficients in the second expression is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but that seems high. Let me check again. Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Maybe the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just 6, because the second expression doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. But that can't be right because when you multiply two expressions, the coefficients multiply. So, if the second expression has a sum of coefficients 64, then yes, 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nBut let me think differently. Let's consider that each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 64, as I found earlier. So, 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me confirm this with an example. Suppose I have (a + b)^1 * (c + 1/c)^1. Then, the coefficient of a^1b^1 would be 1 (from a + b) times (1 + 1) from c + 1/c, which is 2. So, the coefficient would be 2. Similarly, in that case, it's correct. So, applying the same logic, in our problem, it's 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me make sure. Alternatively, perhaps the coefficient is just 6, because the other terms don't affect a and b. But that doesn't seem right because when you multiply two polynomials, each term in one is multiplied by each term in the other, so the coefficient would indeed be 6 times the sum of coefficients in the second expression.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning that \\(c\\) terms cancel out. But the problem just says \\(a^2b^2\\), without specifying any \\(c\\) terms, so perhaps it's considering all possible \\(c\\) terms, but since \\(a^2b^2\\) is independent of \\(c\\), the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of coefficients in the second expression, which is 64, giving 384.\n\nWait, but let me check another way. Let's expand both expressions and see.\n\nFirst, \\((a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6.\n\nNow, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem, this is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\binom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\binom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\).\n\nSo, the expansion is \\(c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15c^{-2} + 6c^{-4} + c^{-6}\\).\n\nNow, when we multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), resulting in terms like \\(6a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(6a^2b^2c^4\\), \\(6a^2b^2c^2\\), \\(6a^2b^2\\), etc.\n\nBut the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, in the entire product, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the sum of all the coefficients from the second expression multiplied by 6. Because each term in the second expression contributes a coefficient when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), and we're summing over all possible \\(c\\) terms.\n\nWait, but that's the same as saying 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expression. The sum of coefficients in the second expression is when \\(c = 1\\), which is \\(2^6 = 64\\). So, 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the expansion of the second expression, the coefficients are 1, 6, 15, 20, 15, 6, 1. So, summing these gives 1 + 6 = 7, 7 +15=22, 22+20=42, 42+15=57, 57+6=63, 63+1=64. So, yes, sum is 64.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. Because in the product, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, for \\(a^2b^2\\), which has a coefficient of 6 in the first part, when multiplied by each term in the second part, the coefficients from the second part are 1, 6, 15, 20, 15, 6, 1. So, the total coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) across all terms would be 6*(1 + 6 + 15 + 20 + 15 + 6 + 1) = 6*64 = 384.\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, the coefficient is 384.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Another approach: The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Since the sum of coefficients in the second expression is 64, then 6*64=384.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem had asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), that would be different, because then we would have to find the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. But since the problem just asks for \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\), it's the sum of all coefficients from the second expression times 6.\n\nYes, I think that's correct. So, the final answer is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(2^6 = 64\\). Multiplying these gives \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\boxed{384}."

    "text": " Wait, but actually, looking again, the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Hmm, but \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term that involves both \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), while the other part of the product involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, does that mean the coefficient is just from the \\((a + b)^4\\) part? Because the other part doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\) at all. Let me think.\n\nSo, the expression is the product of two binomial expansions: one in terms of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the other in terms of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). When we multiply them together, each term in the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But since the problem is only asking about the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), that term must come from the part of the product where the \\((a + b)^4\\) term is multiplied by 1 (from the second expansion). Because if we take any term from the second expansion that has \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), then the resulting term would have those variables, but since we're only interested in \\(a^2b^2\\), the coefficient is only affected by the terms where \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) cancel out, which is only possible if we take the term where the exponents of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) are zero. Wait, but in the second expansion, each term is either \\(c^k\\) or \\(c^{-k}\\), so the only way to get a term without \\(c\\) is if we take a term where the exponents cancel, but actually, the second expansion is \\((c + 1/c)^6\\), so each term is of the form \\(\\binom{6}{k}c^{6 - k}(1/c)^k = \\binom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, to get a term without \\(c\\), we need \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\). So, the coefficient from the second expansion when \\(k=3\\) is \\(\\binom{6}{3} = 20\\), and the term is \\(c^{6 - 6} = c^0 = 1\\). So, the only term in the second expansion that doesn't involve \\(c\\) is 20, so when we multiply by the first expansion, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is just 20 times the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\). \n\nNow, let's find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\). Using the binomial theorem, the expansion is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^4 \\binom{4}{k}a^{4 - k}b^k\\). So, the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) occurs is when \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\), so the coefficient is \\(\\binom{4}{2} = 6\\). Therefore, the coefficient from the first part is 6, and when we multiply by the 20 from the second part, we get 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't miss anything. So, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times (c + 1/c)^6\\). When expanding, each term is a product of a term from the first expansion and a term from the second. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the first expansion, and to get a term without any \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), we have to take the term from the second expansion that's just a constant, which is when \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) are raised to exponents that cancel each other out, which happens only when \\(k=3\\), as I found earlier. So, that term is 20, and so the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nWait, but another way to think about it is that the entire expression is a product, so the coefficients multiply. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product is the product of the coefficients from each part. Since the second part's term is 20, as we found, and the first part's coefficient is 6, so 6 * 20 is indeed 120. \n\nLet me just check if there's another term in the second expansion that could contribute. For example, if there's a term in the second expansion that could contribute to \\(a^2b^2\\) when multiplied by something else, but no, because \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), so the only way \\(a^2b^2\\) can appear is if we take \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion and multiply it by 1 from the second expansion. So, that's correct. \n\nTherefore, the coefficient is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplying it by the constant term (20) from the expansion of \\((c + 1/c)^6\\). \n\nSo, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n$\\boxed{120}$"

    "text": " Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I remember that when you have an expression like \\((a + b)^n\\), you can expand it using the binomial theorem. The binomial theorem says that \\((a + b)^n = \\sum_{k=0}^{n} \\binom{n}{k} a^{n - k} b^{k}\\). So, maybe I can apply this to both parts of the given expression.\n\nThe problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\). Let me handle that part first.\n\nFor \\((a + b)^4\\), I need to find the term where the powers of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2. Using the binomial theorem, the general term is \\(\\binom{4}{k} a^{4 - k} b^{k}\\). So, I want \\(a^2b^2\\), which means \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(\\binom{4}{2}\\).\n\nCalculating \\(\\binom{4}{2}\\), which is \\(\\frac{4!}{2!2!} = \\frac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\nNow, the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and that term is only in the first part, I think I don't need to consider the \\(c\\) terms when looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, no, actually, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product. Hmm, maybe I need to clarify that.\n\nWait, no, actually, the expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when you multiply these two expansions together, each term from the first expansion is multiplied by each term from the second expansion. However, the problem is asking specifically for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, that means that the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by every term in the second expansion, each time contributing a coefficient to the overall expression. But the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so perhaps it's just the coefficient from the first part, 6, times the entire second expansion, but that doesn't make sense because the second expansion has multiple terms. Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating.\n\nWait, no, perhaps I misread the problem. Let me check again: it says, \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is part of the first factor, and when you multiply by the second factor, each term in the product will have some combination of \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\), and \\(1/c\\). But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, that means that in the entire expansion, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times any power of \\(c\\) is just 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that seems too broad because the problem is probably expecting a numerical coefficient, not an expression involving \\(c\\).\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, but I think the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, in other words, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion. But that doesn't make sense because the second expansion isn't just a scalar; it's a polynomial in \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some specific \\(k\\), but it's not specified. Wait, the problem just says \\(a^2b^2\\), so maybe it's considering the entire expression as a polynomial in \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\), and \\(1/c\\), and it's asking for the coefficient of the term where \\(a\\) is squared, \\(b\\) is squared, and the rest are variables involving \\(c\\). But that seems too vague.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think again. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, in the product, each term will be of the form \\(\\binom{4}{k} a^{2}b^{2} \\times \\binom{6}{m} c^{n}\\) where \\(n\\) depends on \\(m\\). But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), perhaps it's just the coefficient from the first part, 6, times the entire expansion of the second part, which is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which would be 6 times \\(2^6\\) since each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) has coefficients that sum to \\(2^6 = 64\\). So, 6 times 64 would be 384. But I'm not sure if that's what the problem is asking because it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not the sum of coefficients multiplied by that term.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me try to parse it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\).\" So, in the product, each term is a product of a term from the first expansion and a term from the second. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first expansion, specifically from \\(\\binom{4}{2}a^2b^2\\). Then, when you multiply this by any term from the second expansion, which is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), you'll get terms like \\(\\binom{4}{2}a^2b^2 \\times \\binom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be \\(\\binom{4}{2}\\) times the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion. But the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), so \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\nWait, but that seems high. Let me think again. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the powers of \\(c\\), which would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but that doesn't make sense because the coefficient should be a number, not a polynomial.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Perhaps the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable, so the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, not a number. So, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), that is, the term where the powers of \\(c\\) cancel out, i.e., \\(c^0\\). That might make more sense.\n\nSo, if that's the case, then we need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product. So, that would involve two steps: first, find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), and then multiply those two coefficients together.\n\nSo, let's do that. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, as we found earlier. Now, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) can be found using the binomial theorem. The general term is \\(\\binom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\times (1/c)^k = \\binom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We want the exponent of \\(c\\) to be 0, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which implies \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(\\binom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire product is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nWait, but the problem didn't specify \\(c^0\\), it just said \\(a^2b^2\\). So, perhaps the problem is indeed asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). But in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which would make the coefficient a polynomial, not a number. That doesn't seem right because the problem is likely expecting a numerical answer.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, so the coefficient would be 6 times the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, which seems unlikely because the problem is probably expecting a numerical value.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me check the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, perhaps it's just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, meaning that the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, which seems odd because the problem is likely expecting a number.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is miswritten, and it's supposed to ask for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would make sense. Alternatively, maybe it's expecting the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by the constant term from the second expansion. That would make sense because then the answer would be a number.\n\nSo, assuming that, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part is 20, so the total coefficient would be 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, then it's 6 times the entire expansion of the second part, which would be 6*(c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15/c^2 + 6/c^4 + 1/c^6), which is a polynomial, but the problem is probably expecting a numerical coefficient, so I think the intended answer is 120.\n\nWait, but let me make sure. Let's consider that when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times each term in the second expansion. But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, not a number. So, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when considering only the terms where the powers of \\(c\\) are zero, i.e., the constant term.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion, which is 20, so 6*20=120.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, then it's 6 times the entire expansion of the second part, but that would make the coefficient a polynomial, which is unlikely. Therefore, I think the intended answer is 120.\n\nWait, but let me think again. If I expand \\((a + b)^4\\), I get terms up to \\(a^4\\) and \\(b^4\\). Similarly, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) expands to terms involving \\(c^6\\) down to \\(c^{-6}\\). So, when you multiply these together, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by all the terms in the second expansion, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), etc. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is actually the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by 6. But that sum is the sum of the coefficients of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), so \\(2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6*64=384.\n\nWait, but that would mean the coefficient is 384, but that's if we're considering all powers of \\(c\\). So, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), then it's 384. But if it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it's 120.\n\nI think I need to clarify this. The problem says, \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, in the product, each term is a product of a term from the first expansion and a term from the second. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first expansion, and it's multiplied by each term from the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, not a number. So, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when multiplied by the constant term of the second expansion, which would be 6*20=120.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which would be 6 times the entire expansion of the second part, but that seems unlikely because the problem is probably expecting a numerical answer.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is miswritten, and it's supposed to ask for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would make the answer 120. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, considering all possible powers of \\(c\\), which would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6*64=384.\n\nBut I think the more likely scenario is that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, so the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of the second part. But that would make the coefficient a polynomial, which doesn't make sense because the problem is probably expecting a number.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, meaning that it's just the coefficient from the first part, 6, because the second part is a separate expansion. But that doesn't make sense because the product would have cross terms involving \\(c\\).\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me try to think differently. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, in the product, each term is a product of a term from the first expansion and a term from the second. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) is only from the first expansion, and it's multiplied by each term in the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the entire expansion of the second part. But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, not a number. Therefore, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when multiplied by the constant term of the second expansion, which is 20, so 6*20=120.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion, which is 6, and not considering the second expansion at all, but that seems unlikely because the problem includes both factors.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of the second part, but that would make the coefficient a polynomial, which is not a number. Therefore, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be 6*20=120.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6*64=384.\n\nI think I need to decide which interpretation is correct. Since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and not specifying any particular power of \\(c\\), I think it's more likely that it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), which would be 6 times the entire expansion of the second part. But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, which is not a number, so that can't be right.\n\nTherefore, the more plausible interpretation is that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where \\(a\\) is squared, \\(b\\) is squared, and \\(c\\) is to the zero power. Therefore, the coefficient would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion, which is 20, so 6*20=120.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion, which is 6, and the second expansion is irrelevant. But that seems unlikely because the problem includes both factors.\n\nWait, but if you think about it, when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum of the products of the coefficients of terms whose variables multiply to give that specific term. So, in this case, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) can only come from the first expansion, specifically the term \\(6a^2b^2\\), and it is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. However, since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of the second part. But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, which is not a number. Therefore, the problem must be asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, considering only the terms where the powers of \\(c\\) are zero, which is 120.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion, which is 6, and the second expansion is irrelevant because it's multiplied by other terms. But that doesn't make sense because the problem includes both factors.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, which would be 6 times the entire expansion of the second part. But that would make the coefficient a polynomial, which is not a number, so that can't be right.\n\nTherefore, I think the intended answer is 120, assuming that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\).\n\nWait, but let me confirm. Let's compute the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product. As we said, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part is 20, so the total coefficient is 6*20=120.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), then it's 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6*64=384. But I think the more likely answer is 120 because it's more common to ask for a specific term, including the powers of other variables.\n\nWait, but the problem didn't specify any power of \\(c\\), so perhaps it's expecting 384. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which is 6 times the entire expansion of the second part, but that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, which is not a number, so that can't be right.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is miswritten, and it's supposed to ask for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would make the answer 120. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, considering only the constant term with respect to \\(c\\), which would be 120.\n\nI think I've spent enough time thinking about this, and I'm going to go with 120 as the answer, assuming that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). So, the coefficient is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. To find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, we consider the constant term (with respect to \\(c\\)) from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20. Multiplying these together gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\boxed{120}."

    "text": " Hmm, okay, so I need to figure out the coefficient when these two expressions are multiplied together. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I think I should handle each part separately. The expression is a product of two binomial expressions, so maybe I can expand each one separately and then see how they combine. But wait, actually, I only need the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so maybe I don't have to expand everything. That would save time.\n\nStarting with the first part: \\((a + b)^4\\). I remember from the binomial theorem that the expansion of \\((x + y)^n\\) is the sum from k=0 to n of \\(\\binom{n}{k}x^{n-k}y^k\\). So, applying that here, the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) will have terms like \\(\\binom{4}{k}a^{4 - k}b^k\\) for k from 0 to 4.\n\nSince I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I need the term where the powers of a and b are 2 each. So, that would be when \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). So, the coefficient is \\(\\binom{4}{2}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\binom{4}{2} = \\frac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6.\n\nNow, moving on to the second part: \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Similarly, I can apply the binomial theorem here. The expansion will have terms \\(\\binom{6}{m}c^{6 - m}\\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\), where m ranges from 0 to 6.\n\nSimplifying that, each term becomes \\(\\binom{6}{m}c^{6 - m}c^{-m} = \\binom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the exponents of c will be 6 - 2m. Now, since I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, I think I need to consider the product of the two expansions. That is, each term from \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by each term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nBut wait, hold on. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) is only from the first part, and the second part is in terms of c and 1/c. So, when I multiply them together, the variables a, b, c are all separate. Therefore, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by some term from the second expansion, which is in terms of c. But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I think that term will be multiplied by all possible terms from the second expansion, but since the second expansion doesn't involve a or b, maybe I just need to consider the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and then multiply it by the entire second expansion, because all terms in the second expansion will just add coefficients to the existing terms in the first expansion.\n\nWait, actually, no. Let me think again. When you multiply two polynomials, each term from the first polynomial is multiplied by each term from the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term from the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part.\n\nWait, but the second part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a Laurent polynomial in c. So, when we multiply, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion.\n\nBut wait, is that correct? Let me check. Suppose I have (A + B)(C + D), then the coefficient of a specific term in A or B would be multiplied by all terms in the other polynomial. So, if I'm looking for a term in A, say, then the coefficient of that term in the first polynomial is multiplied by the entire second polynomial. Therefore, the coefficient of A in the product would be the coefficient of A in the first polynomial times the sum of coefficients in the second polynomial.\n\nWait, but in this case, the second polynomial is in terms of c and 1/c, so when we multiply, the variables are separate. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second part, each of which is a power of c. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by each term in the second part, but since the second part has multiple terms, each with their own coefficients, the total coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would actually be the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the entire second expansion. But that doesn't make sense because the second expansion is a sum of terms with different powers of c. So, maybe I'm overcomplicating it.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, the expression is a product of two polynomials, one in a and b, and the other in c and 1/c. Therefore, when we multiply them, the variables are separate. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will only come from the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by each term in the second part. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part.\n\nWait, but the second part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), so the sum of all coefficients would be obtained by setting c = 1. Because substituting c = 1 gives the sum of the coefficients. So, let's compute that.\n\nFirst, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6, as we found earlier. Now, the sum of coefficients in the second part is \\(\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = (2)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me verify that. So, the product is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). When we expand this, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6a^2b^2, and it's multiplied by each term in the second part, which is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^6 \\binom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 multiplied by the sum of the coefficients of each term in the second part, which is indeed 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nBut wait, let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. Because when we multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in one polynomial is multiplied by the entire other polynomial, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the entire second polynomial. But since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of c, we need to consider all the terms in the second polynomial, each multiplied by 6a^2b^2. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients of the second polynomial, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, if we think about the entire product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by every term from the second polynomial, so the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me think differently. Suppose I don't consider the sum of coefficients, but instead, think about each term in the product. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion is 6a^2b^2, and when multiplied by each term in the second expansion, which is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^6 \\binom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\), the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times each coefficient in the second expansion. But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of c, we need to sum all those coefficients. Wait, no, that's not correct because each term in the second expansion is multiplied by 6a^2b^2, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the entire second expansion, but that's not a single coefficient. Hmm, maybe I'm confusing something here.\n\nWait, perhaps I should think of it this way: the entire product is a polynomial in a, b, c, and 1/c. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will appear multiplied by different powers of c. But the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of c. So, that would mean we need to sum all the coefficients from the second expansion, because each term in the second expansion, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), contributes to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times some power of c. But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of c's exponent, we can consider that coefficient as being multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion.\n\nWait, that makes sense. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. Therefore, as calculated earlier, 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nBut let me make sure. Alternatively, if I set c = 1, then \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) becomes \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\), which is the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. Therefore, when I set c = 1, the entire product becomes \\((a + b)^4 * 64\\). Then, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in this product is 6 * 64 = 384, which matches our earlier calculation.\n\nSo, I think that's correct. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 384.\n\nWait, but just to be thorough, let me try another approach. Let's consider the entire expansion.\n\nFirst, expand \\((a + b)^4\\):\n\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^4 \\binom{4}{k}a^{4 - k}b^k\n\\]\n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\binom{4}{2} = 6\\), as we found.\n\nNow, expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):\n\n\\[\n\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^6 \\binom{6}{m}c^{6 - m}\\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^6 \\binom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\n\\]\n\nSo, each term is \\(\\binom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\).\n\nNow, when we multiply these two expansions together, each term from the first expansion is multiplied by each term from the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion (which is 6a^2b^2) is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, which is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^6 \\binom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\).\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be 6 multiplied by each coefficient from the second expansion, but since we're interested in the coefficient regardless of the power of c, we need to sum all these contributions. That is, the total coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion.\n\nThe sum of all coefficients in the second expansion is found by setting c = 1, which gives us \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\), as before.\n\nTherefore, the total coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nYes, that seems consistent. So, I think the answer is 384.\n\nBut just to be absolutely sure, let me consider an alternative method. Suppose I consider the entire product as a product of two polynomials and think about the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Since the second polynomial doesn't involve a or b, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is simply the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial multiplied by the entire second polynomial. But when we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of c, it's equivalent to multiplying by the sum of the coefficients of the second polynomial, which is 64. So, again, 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nI think that's solid. So, the coefficient is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is found by considering each part separately and then combining them. \n\n1. Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\binom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n\n2. Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem. The sum of all coefficients is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), resulting in \\(2^6 = 64\\).\n\n3. Multiply the two coefficients: \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\(\\boxed{384}\\)."

Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by a term involving \\(c^0\\), you just get \\(a^2b^2\\), and if you multiply it by any other power of \\(c\\), it would change the term, but we're only interested in \\(a^2b^2\\), so we can ignore the \\(c\\) parts.\n\nOkay, so I can separate the problem into two parts:\n\n1. Find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\).\n2. Find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nThen, multiply these two coefficients together to get the final coefficient in the product.\n\nLet me start with the first part.\n\n**Part 1: Coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\).**\n\nUsing the binomial theorem, \\((a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\binom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^{k}\\).\n\nWe want the term where \\(a^2b^2\\), which means \\(a^{4 - k}b^{k} = a^2b^2\\). So, we can set up the equations:\n\n\\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\).\n\nSo, solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(k = 2\\).\n\nTherefore, the coefficient is \\(\\binom{4}{2}\\).\n\nCalculating that, \\(\\binom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\).\n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\n**Part 2: Coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).**\n\nAgain, using the binomial theorem, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\binom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\).\n\nSimplifying each term, we have:\n\n\\(\\binom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\cdot c^{-m} = \\binom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\).\n\nWe need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so we set:\n\n\\(6 - 2m = 0\\).\n\nSolving for \\(m\\):\n\n\\(6 = 2m\\) \u2192 \\(m = 3\\).\n\nSo, the coefficient is \\(\\binom{6}{3}\\).\n\nCalculating that, \\(\\binom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\).\n\nWait, hold on, that doesn't seem right. Let me check the factorial calculations again.\n\nActually, \\(6! = 720\\), and \\(3! = 6\\), so \\(\\binom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{720}{(6)(6)} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). Hmm, that's correct. So, the coefficient is 20.\n\nWait, no, actually, that's not correct. Wait, 6! is 720, but 3! is 6, so 720 divided by (6*6) is 720/36, which is indeed 20. So, yes, 20 is correct.\n\nWait, but I just feel like \\(\\binom{6}{3}\\) is 20. Let me check another way: 6 choose 3 is 20, yes, because 6C3 = 20. Okay, that's correct.\n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20.\n\n**Putting it all together:**\n\nNow, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the two coefficients we found.\n\nSo, 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the second part) equals 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 120.\n\nWait, let me just double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\n1. For \\((a + b)^4\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed when \\(k = 2\\), so \\(\\binom{4}{2} = 6\\). That seems correct.\n\n2. For \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term with \\(c^0\\) occurs when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), so \\(m = 3\\), and \\(\\binom{6}{3} = 20\\). That also seems correct.\n\nMultiplying 6 and 20 gives 120, so the final coefficient is 120.\n\nI think that's correct. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break the problem into two parts:\n\n1. **Coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\):**\n   Using the binomial theorem, \\((a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\binom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^{k}\\). The term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\), so the coefficient is \\(\\binom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n\n2. **Coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   Using the binomial theorem, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\binom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying each term gives \\(\\binom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). The term with \\(c^0\\) occurs when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), so \\(m = 3\\), and the coefficient is \\(\\binom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n\nMultiplying these coefficients together, we get \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

    "text": " Hmm, okay, so I need to find the coefficient for a specific term in a product of two expansions. Let me try to break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I know that when you expand expressions like \\((a + b)^n\\) or \\((c + d)^m\\), you can use the binomial theorem. The binomial theorem says that \\((x + y)^n = \\sum_{k=0}^{n} \\binom{n}{k} x^{n - k} y^{k}\\), where \\(\\binom{n}{k}\\) is the binomial coefficient, which can be found using combinations.\n\nSo, in this problem, we have two separate binomial expressions multiplied together: \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The question is asking about the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait a minute, that's a term involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), but the second part of the product involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, does that mean that the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is only coming from the first binomial expansion, and the second expansion doesn't affect it? Because \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\).\n\nLet me think. When you multiply two expressions together, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would come from the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), and then multiplied by some term from the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't have any \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\) in it, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually be the coefficient from the first part times the coefficient from the second part for the constant term (i.e., where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out).\n\nWait, that might not be right. Let me clarify. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by some term from the second expansion. But \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are fixed, but the exponents of \\(c\\) can vary. So, if we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), that might be different. But I think the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, considering all possible terms. Hmm, that might be more complicated.\n\nWait, no, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Let me read the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, it's asking for the coefficient of the term \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by any term from the second expansion. So, in other words, the coefficient would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire second expansion, because each term in the second expansion will multiply each term in the first expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't make much sense because the coefficient would then be a polynomial in \\(c\\), not a single number.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times any term involving \\(c\\), but I think more likely, it's asking for the coefficient of the term \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in other words, the coefficient would be the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems a bit odd because the coefficients in the second expansion depend on the powers of \\(c\\).\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. Maybe the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all terms in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that would make the coefficient a sum of multiple terms, which isn't a single number. Alternatively, maybe it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by a specific term in the second expansion, but the problem doesn't specify any particular power of \\(c\\). Hmm, this is confusing.\n\nWait, maybe I should consider that the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of the term \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2 each, and the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out (i.e., \\(c^0\\)). That would make sense because otherwise, the coefficient would involve terms with different powers of \\(c\\), which isn't a single number. So, perhaps the problem is implicitly asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2 each, and the exponents of \\(c\\) are 0.\n\nIf that's the case, then I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), and then multiply them together.\n\nOkay, let's proceed with that understanding.\n\nFirst, let's find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\). Using the binomial theorem, the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is:\n\n\\[\n\\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\binom{4}{k} a^{4 - k} b^{k}\n\\]\n\nWe want the term where \\(a^2b^2\\), so \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). So, the coefficient is \\(\\binom{4}{2}\\).\n\nCalculating that:\n\n\\[\n\\binom{4}{2} = \\frac{4!}{2!2!} = \\frac{24}{4} = 6\n\\]\n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\nNext, we need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Again, using the binomial theorem, the expansion is:\n\n\\[\n\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\binom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^{m} = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\binom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m} = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\binom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n\\]\n\nWe want the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so we set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\):\n\n\\[\n6 - 2m = 0 \\Rightarrow 2m = 6 \\Rightarrow m = 3\n\\]\n\nSo, the coefficient is \\(\\binom{6}{3}\\).\n\nCalculating that:\n\n\\[\n\\binom{6}{3} = \\frac{6!}{3!3!} = \\frac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\frac{720}{36} = 20\n\\]\n\nWait, that's not correct. Wait, 6! is 720, but 3! is 6, so 6!/(3!3!) = 720/(6*6) = 720/36 = 20. Yes, that's correct. So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20.\n\nNow, since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we multiply the two coefficients we found:\n\n6 (from \\(a^2b^2\\)) multiplied by 20 (from \\(c^0\\)) equals 120.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is 120.\n\nWait, but let me double-check to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. So, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6. In \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term where the exponent is 0 is when m=3, which gives us \\(\\binom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, 6*20=120. Yeah, that seems right.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem was just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the c terms, then the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which would make the coefficient a polynomial in c. But since the problem didn't specify any particular power of c, I think the intended interpretation is that we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nSo, I think that's the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we consider the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2 each, and the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out (i.e., \\(c^0\\)).\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\binom{4}{k} a^{4 - k} b^{k}\n   \\]\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\binom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n\n2. **Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\binom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n   \\]\n   The coefficient of \\(c^0\\) occurs when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which gives \\(m = 3\\). Thus, the coefficient is \\(\\binom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n\n3. **Multiply the coefficients:**\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 20 = 120\n   \\]\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

    "text": " Hmm, okay, let me try to figure this out step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that when you have an expression like \\((a + b)^n\\), you can expand it using the binomial theorem. The binomial theorem says that each term in the expansion is of the form \\(\\dbinom{n}{k} a^{n - k} b^k\\), where \\(k\\) goes from 0 to \\(n\\). So, maybe I can apply that here.\n\nLooking at the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), I can expand this using the binomial theorem. Let me write that out:\n\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k} b^k\n\\]\n\nSo, the terms in this expansion will be:\n\n- When \\(k = 0\\): \\(\\dbinom{4}{0} a^4 b^0 = 1 \\cdot a^4\\)\n- When \\(k = 1\\): \\(\\dbinom{4}{1} a^3 b^1 = 4 a^3 b\\)\n- When \\(k = 2\\): \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} a^2 b^2 = 6 a^2 b^2\\)\n- When \\(k = 3\\): \\(\\dbinom{4}{3} a^1 b^3 = 4 a b^3\\)\n- When \\(k = 4\\): \\(\\dbinom{4}{4} a^0 b^4 = 1 \\cdot b^4\\)\n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(a^2 b^2\\) in this expansion is 6. That's straightforward.\n\nBut wait, the problem isn't just \\((a + b)^4\\); it's multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I need to consider that entire expression. So, the full expression is:\n\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\n\\]\n\nI need the coefficient of \\(a^2 b^2\\). Hmm, okay, so when I multiply these two expressions together, each term from \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2 b^2\\), I can think about how that term interacts with the other expression.\n\nWait, but actually, since the first part is \\((a + b)^4\\) and the second part is in terms of \\(c\\), which is a different variable. So, when I multiply them together, the variables \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are only present in the first part, and the variables \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) are only in the second part. So, when I multiply, the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) won't interfere with the terms involving \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2 b^2\\) in the entire product will just be the coefficient of \\(a^2 b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire second expression, because the \\(c\\) terms don't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms.\n\nWait, no, that doesn't make sense. Because when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2 b^2\\) in the product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2 b^2\\) in the first part times the sum of all the terms in the second part. But since the second part is a separate expression, maybe I can think of it as the coefficient being multiplied by the entire second expression.\n\nBut wait, no, that's not quite right. Let me think again. If I have \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), then each term in the expansion will be a product of a term from the first expansion and a term from the second. So, the term \\(a^2 b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by every term from the second part. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2 b^2\\) in the entire product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2 b^2\\) in the first part (which is 6) multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. But that seems like it would make the coefficient a polynomial in \\(c\\), not a single coefficient. Hmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2 b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, maybe it's considering only the part of the product that has \\(a^2 b^2\\) times any combination of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would still be a polynomial in \\(c\\), not a single coefficient.

But that seems like the answer would be a polynomial, not a number.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2 b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), i.e., the constant term in \\(c\\). So, the coefficient would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\).\n\nLet me try that approach. So, first, find the coefficient of \\(a^2 b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6. Then, find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Then, multiply those two coefficients together.\n\nSo, let's compute the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem again:\n\n\\[\n\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n\\]\n\nWe need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\):\n\n\\(6 - 2k = 0\\)\n\n\\(2k = 6\\)\n\n\\(k = 3\\)\n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\).\n\nCalculating that:\n\n\\[\n\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\n\\]\n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2 b^2 c^0\\) in the entire product is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nWait, but the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2 b^2\\), not \\(a^2 b^2 c^0\\). So, maybe I'm overcomplicating again. If the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2 b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, then it's 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which would be a polynomial. But the problem is asking for a coefficient, which is a number, so perhaps it's intended to find the coefficient of \\(a^2 b^2\\) times the constant term in \\(c\\), which is 120.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is simply to find the coefficient of \\(a^2 b^2\\) in the product, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, so the coefficient would be 6 times the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\).

Let me think differently. Since the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2 b^2\\), and the expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the variables \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are all independent.

    "text": " Hmm, that seems a bit tricky, but let me try to break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I know that when you expand a binomial like \\((a + b)^n\\), you can use the binomial theorem, which states that each term is of the form \\(\\binom{n}{k} a^{n - k} b^k\\). So, maybe I can apply that here.\n\nLooking at the first part of the expression, \\((a + b)^4\\), I want to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). That means I need the term where \\(a\\) is squared and \\(b\\) is squared. So, in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\), the term with \\(a^2b^2\\) would be \\(\\binom{4}{2} a^2b^2\\). Let me calculate that binomial coefficient.\n\nThe binomial coefficient \\(\\binom{4}{2}\\) is calculated as \\(\\frac{4!}{2!2!}\\). Calculating that: 4! is 24, and 2! is 2, so 24 divided by (2*2) is 24/4 = 6. So, the coefficient is 6. That means in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) has a coefficient of 6.\n\nNow, the problem is about the entire expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I'm supposed to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in this product. Wait, but \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are variables separate from \\(c\\). So, when I multiply these two expressions, the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) will come from the first part, and the terms involving \\(c\\) will come from the second part.\n\nBut the problem is asking only for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). That implies that we might be considering the entire product, but perhaps we are only interested in terms where \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are squared, regardless of what's happening with \\(c\\). Or maybe we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, which would include all possible terms involving \\(c\\). Hmm, that might complicate things.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is structured such that when you multiply the two expansions, you get a product of terms, each from the first expansion and each from the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would come from the first expansion, and then multiplied by some term from the second expansion, which is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nBut if that's the case, then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the sum of all terms from the second expansion, because when you multiply 6\\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, each term would contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by whatever power of \\(c\\) they have. But wait, the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. Hmm, that might not make sense because \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\). So, perhaps the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just 6 times whatever the coefficient is in the second expansion for the term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), but that seems odd because the second expansion would involve powers of \\(c\\).\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think again. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, that would mean that when you expand the entire product, you look for the term where \\(a\\) is squared, \\(b\\) is squared, and then the rest of the variables come from the second expansion. But since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), perhaps the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would just be 6 times the entire expansion of the second part, but that doesn't make sense because the second part is a separate variable.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without considering the \\(c\\) terms. So, perhaps the answer is just 6, because the \\(c\\) terms don't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. But that seems too simplistic, so maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where \\(a\\) is squared, \\(b\\) is squared, and \\(c\\) is to the zero power. That would make sense because then we're looking for the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\), which is 1. So, the coefficient would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nAh, that makes more sense. So, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), which would be the constant term in the second expansion. So, first, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), and then multiply that by 6, which is the coefficient from the first part.\n\nSo, let's work on finding the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Again, using the binomial theorem, each term in the expansion is \\(\\binom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k\\), which simplifies to \\(\\binom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} c^{-k} = \\binom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\).\n\nWe want the exponent of \\(c\\) to be zero, so we set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the term where \\(k=3\\) is the constant term. The coefficient is \\(\\binom{6}{3}\\).\n\nCalculating \\(\\binom{6}{3}\\): 6! / (3!3!) = (720)/(6*6) = 720/36 = 20. So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20.\n\nNow, going back to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire product is the product of the coefficients from each part. So, from the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, and from the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Therefore, the total coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but let me double-check that. So, the term in the first expansion is 6\\(a^2b^2\\), and the term in the second expansion is 20\\(c^0\\), which is 20. So, when you multiply them together, you get 6 * 20 \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120\\(a^2b^2\\). So, yes, the coefficient is 120.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem was just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without considering \\(c\\), then it would just be 6, but that seems unlikely because \\(c\\) is part of the expression. So, I think the correct approach is to consider the constant term in the second expansion and multiply by 6, giving 120.\n\nWait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in calculating \\(\\binom{6}{3}\\). 6 choose 3 is indeed 20 because 6*5*4/(3*2*1) = 120/6 = 20. So that's correct.\n\nAnd in the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is the middle term, so the coefficient is 6, which is correct.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but hold on a second. The problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", but in the entire product, \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by terms from the second expansion. So, perhaps the problem is expecting just the coefficient from the first part, but I don't think so because the second part is part of the entire expression.\n\nWait, but in the product, each term from the first expansion is multiplied by each term from the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion is multiplied by each term from the second expansion, which includes various powers of \\(c\\). So, if we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, then that would mean summing over all possible terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any power of \\(c\\). But that's not possible because \\(a^2b^2\\) is a separate term from \\(c\\), so the coefficient would just be 6 times the entire second expansion, which is not a single number. So, that can't be right.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, so it's the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), as I thought earlier. So, that would be 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), which is 120, as I calculated. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, but that would require considering all possible \\(c\\) terms, which doesn't make sense because the coefficient would then be a polynomial in \\(c\\), not a single number.\n\nTherefore, I think the correct interpretation is that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nWait, but let me check again. The problem says: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)\".\n\nSo, perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), treating \\(c\\) as another variable, but in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which would be a polynomial in \\(c\\). But that seems unlikely because the question is asking for a numerical coefficient, not a polynomial.\n\nTherefore, I think the intended interpretation is that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the constant term with respect to \\(c\\), so that the coefficient is 120.\n\nWait, another way to think about it is that when you multiply two expressions, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each factor. So, in this case, to get \\(a^2b^2\\), you take the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first factor, which has coefficient 6, and then you multiply it by the term \\(c^0\\) from the second factor, which has coefficient 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So, I think 120 is the correct answer.\n\nJust to recap:\n\n1. Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is 6.\n\n2. Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\), which is 20.\n\n3. Multiply these two coefficients together to get the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product, which is 120.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break down the problem into two parts using the binomial theorem.\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\):**\n   Using the binomial theorem, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is given by:\n   \\[\n   \\binom{4}{2} a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\n   \\]\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6.\n\n2. **Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero (i.e., the constant term). Using the binomial theorem, each term in the expansion is:\n   \\[\n   \\binom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\binom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n   \\]\n   Setting the exponent to zero, we solve \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), giving \\(k = 3\\). The coefficient is:\n   \\[\n   \\binom{6}{3} = 20\n   \\]\n\n3. **Combine the results:**\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the product of the coefficients from each part. Therefore, we multiply 6 (from the first expansion) by 20 (from the second expansion):\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 20 = 120\n   \\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

    "text": " Hmm, okay, so I need to figure out how to approach this. Let me think step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that when you have an expression like \\((a + b)^n\\), you can expand it using the binomial theorem. The binomial theorem states that \\((a + b)^n = \\sum_{k=0}^{n} \\binom{n}{k} a^{n - k} b^k\\). So, each term in the expansion is of the form \\(\\binom{n}{k} a^{n - k} b^k\\).\n\nIn this problem, the first part of the expression is \\((a + b)^4\\). So, applying the binomial theorem here, the expansion would be \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\binom{4}{k} a^{4 - k} b^k\\). I need the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which means I need the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2. \n\nSo, let's find the value of \\(k\\) such that \\(a^{4 - k} b^k = a^2b^2\\). That would mean \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). So, the term is \\(\\binom{4}{2} a^{2} b^{2}\\). The coefficient here is \\(\\binom{4}{2}\\).\n\nI know that \\(\\binom{4}{2}\\) is calculated as \\(\\frac{4!}{2!2!} = \\frac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient from the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), is 6.\n\nNow, the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I need to consider this part as well. But wait, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). That term only involves \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the second part of the expression involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, does that mean that the second part doesn't affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)?\n\nLet me think. When you multiply two expressions together, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). However, since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), we don't need to consider the \\(c\\) terms because they don't affect the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). \n\nIn other words, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the entire second part, which is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, that doesn't make sense because the second part is an expression, not a scalar. So, actually, when you multiply by the second part, each term in the first expression is multiplied by each term in the second expression. However, since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), we can consider that the \\(c\\) terms will be multiplied by some constants, but since we're only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), those \\(c\\) terms can be anything because they don't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) exponents.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me clarify: The term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part will be multiplied by every term in the second part. So, the entire coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be 6 times the entire second expression, but since we're just looking for the coefficient, which is a number, we can treat the second part as a constant when considering the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 multiplied by the sum of all terms in the second part. But that doesn't make sense because each term in the product will have different exponents of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), but we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is just 6 multiplied by the entire second expression, but since we're only looking for the coefficient, which is a numerical factor, we can consider that the second part contributes a factor that doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms, so the coefficient remains 6.\n\nWait, no, that doesn't seem right. Let me think again. When you multiply two expressions, the coefficients multiply as well. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire second expression. But since the second expression is a sum of terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), each term in the second expression is a separate term. However, when you multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), each term in the second expression will create a new term in the product, each with a different power of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), but the coefficient for each of those terms will be 6 times the coefficient from the second expression.\n\nBut the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which implies that we're considering all possible terms that have \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by any combination of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 multiplied by the entire second expression, because each term in the second expression, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), will contribute to a term in the product with \\(a^2b^2\\) and some power of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all terms in the second expression.\n\nWait, but that doesn't make sense because the second expression is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which expands to a sum of terms. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 multiplied by each term in the second expression, but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, the coefficient is 6 times the entire second expression. But that would mean the coefficient is 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is not a numerical coefficient. So, I must be misunderstanding something.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second expression. Because each term in the second expression, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), will contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times some power of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which typically refers to the coefficient regardless of other variables. So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second expression.\n\nWait, but the second expression is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The sum of the coefficients in this expression would be obtained by setting \\(c = 1\\), because that would make each term equal to its coefficient. So, if I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the sum of the coefficients in the second expression is 64. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 multiplied by 64, which is 384.\n\nWait, but let me verify that. If I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = (1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of the coefficients is 64. Therefore, when I multiply the two expressions, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the sum of coefficients from the second part, which is 64, giving 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nBut let me think differently. Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that each term in the product is a combination of a term from the first expansion and a term from the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the first expansion, and it is multiplied by every term in the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 multiplied by the entire second expansion. But since the second expansion is a sum of terms, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually be 6 times the entire second expression, which is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that can't be right because the coefficient should be a number, not an expression.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, meaning that we can treat the second part as a constant when considering the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the entire second expression, but since we're looking for a numerical coefficient, perhaps we need to evaluate the second expression at \\(c = 1\\), which gives 64, so the coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think again. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Since \\(a^2b^2\\) is only from the first part, and the second part is multiplied as a whole, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 multiplied by the entire second expression. But that would mean the coefficient is 6 * \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is not a numerical coefficient. Therefore, perhaps the problem is expecting us to consider that the coefficient is 6, and the rest is part of the term, but that seems unlikely.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the entire second expression, but since the second expression is a sum of terms, each term would have its own coefficient. However, since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the entire second expression, but that doesn't make sense because the second expression isn't a scalar.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, considering all possible terms. So, each term in the product is of the form \\(a^kb^{4 - k} c^m (1/c)^n\\), where \\(k\\) is from 0 to 4, and \\(m\\) and \\(n\\) are from 0 to 6, such that \\(m + n = 6\\). But since we're interested in \\(a^2b^2\\), that corresponds to \\(k = 2\\), so \\(a^2b^2\\), and then the coefficient would be \\(\\binom{4}{2}\\) times the sum of coefficients from the second part for all possible \\(m\\) and \\(n\\).\n\nWait, but that would mean the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. That seems to make sense.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider that the second part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), can be expanded, and each term in that expansion is a coefficient times \\(c^k\\) or \\(c^{-k}\\). So, when you multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), each term becomes \\(a^2b^2\\) times some coefficient times \\(c^k\\) or \\(c^{-k}\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nBut wait, let me think differently. Suppose I expand both parts separately. The first part is \\((a + b)^4\\), which gives terms up to \\(a^4b^0\\) and \\(a^0b^4\\). The second part is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which gives terms like \\(c^6\\), \\(6c^4\\), \\(15c^2\\), \\(20\\), \\(15c^{-2}\\), \\(6c^{-4}\\), \\(c^{-6}\\). So, when I multiply these two expansions, each term in the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(6a^2b^2c^4\\), etc. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is actually 6 times the entire second expansion, but that's not a single coefficient.\n\nWait, but the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would be the sum of all coefficients attached to \\(a^2b^2\\) times any power of \\(c\\). So, that would mean the coefficient is 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. Since the sum of coefficients in the second expansion is obtained by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting just the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, and the second part is irrelevant because it's multiplied by different variables. But that seems unlikely because the problem includes both parts.\n\nWait, let me check an example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^2 (c + 1/c)^1\\). Let's compute the coefficient of \\(a^2b^0\\). In the first part, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^0\\) is \\(\\binom{2}{2} = 1\\). The second part is \\(c + 1/c\\), so when multiplied, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^0\\) would be 1 * (1 + 1) = 2, because the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part is 2 (the constant term). So, in this case, the coefficient is 1 * 2 = 2.\n\nSimilarly, in our problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6, and in the second part, the sum of coefficients is 64, so the total coefficient would be 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but in the example, the second part's constant term is 2, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^0\\) is 1 * 2 = 2. So, in our problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 multiplied by the sum of coefficients in the second part, which is 64, giving 384.\n\nTherefore, I think the correct answer is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is \\(\\binom{4}{2} = 6\\). Next, we consider the entire second part \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The sum of the coefficients in this expansion is obtained by setting \\(c = 1\\), resulting in \\(2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n\\boxed{384}"

The binomial theorem says that \\((a + b)^n = \\sum_{k=0}^{n} \\binom{n}{k} a^{n - k}b^{k}\\). So, for \\((a + b)^4\\), the expansion will have terms from \\(a^4\\) down to \\(b^4\\).\n\nI need the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so let's find that term. Using the binomial theorem, the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) occurs is when \\(k = 2\\) because \\(a^{4 - 2}b^{2}\\) is \\(a^2b^2\\). The coefficient is \\(\\binom{4}{2}\\). Let me calculate that: \\(\\binom{4}{2} = \\frac{4!}{2!2!} = \\frac{24}{4} = 6\\).

So, when we multiply these two expansions together, each term in the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But since we are only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), we can consider that term separately and multiply it by the entire second expansion because any term involving \\(c\\) won't affect the powers of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). Wait, is that correct?\n\nWait, no. Actually, when we multiply the two polynomials together, each term from the first polynomial will be multiplied by each term from the second. But since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\), and \\(1/c\\) are different variables, the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) won't be affected by the \\(c\\) terms. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial multiplied by the entire second polynomial. But that doesn't seem right because the second polynomial is being multiplied as a whole.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think again. The product is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when we expand this, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).

But that would mean that the coefficient is 6 multiplied by the entire expansion, which can't be right because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not a term that includes \\(c\\).\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Let me clarify: The question is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, which includes all possible terms from both expansions. But since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\), and \\(1/c\\) are separate variables, the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are independent of those involving \\(c\\).

But that doesn't make sense because the sum of all coefficients would be when \\(c = 1\\), but that's not what we're being asked.\n\nWait, no. Actually, when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each polynomial. But in this case, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), so when you multiply it by any term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the result will have \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by some power of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which would mean that the coefficient is 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that can't be, because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, not an expression involving \\(c\\).\n\nWait, maybe I'm making a mistake here. Let me think again. The problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\), and \\(1/c\\) are separate variables, the only way to get a term with \\(a^2b^2\\) is to multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first polynomial by every possible term from the second polynomial. But each of those terms will have some power of \\(c\\), so the resulting product will have terms like \\(6a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(6a^2b^2c^4\\), and so on, depending on the terms in the second polynomial. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would mean that it's considering all possible exponents of \\(c\\), but that's not possible because \\(a^2b^2\\) can't have any \\(c\\) terms. Therefore, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, considering only the terms where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out, i.e., where the power of \\(c\\) is zero. That is, the term \\(a^2b^2 \\times c^0\\), which would be \\(a^2b^2 \\times 1\\). So, in that case, we need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which is the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nAh, that makes sense. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nSo, first, we've already found that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\nNow, we need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let's work on that.\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem again. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\binom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\binom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\).\n\nWe need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be 0, so we set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\).\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\binom{6}{3}\\). Let's compute that: \\(\\binom{6}{3} = \\frac{6!}{3!3!} = \\frac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\frac{720}{36} = 20\\).\n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20.\n\nNow, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the product of the two coefficients we found: 6 (from \\(a^2b^2\\)) and 20 (from \\(c^0\\)). So, 6 \u00d7 20 = 120.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 120.\n\nWait, let me just double-check that. So, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6. In \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20, as we found by setting the exponent to zero, which gives k=3, and \\(\\binom{6}{3}=20\\). So, multiplying these gives 6\u00d720=120. That seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of it as the entire term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first polynomial is multiplied by the constant term (c^0) from the second polynomial, so the coefficient is 6\u00d720=120. That makes sense.\n\nSo, I think the answer is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Multiplying these gives 6 \u00d7 20 = 120.\n\n\\boxed{120}"

    "text": " Hmm, let's break this down step by step. \n\nFirst, I think I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\). Then, since the entire expression is multiplied by another term \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), I might need to consider how that affects the coefficient. Wait, but actually, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which only involves the variables a and b. The other part with c might not affect the coefficient of a\u00b2b\u00b2 directly because it's multiplied by another term that doesn't involve a or b. Hmm, maybe I should treat them separately.\n\nLet me start with the first part: \\((a + b)^4\\). I remember the binomial theorem, which states that \\((x + y)^n = \\sum_{k=0}^{n} \\binom{n}{k} x^{n - k} y^k\\). So, applying this to \\((a + b)^4\\), the expansion will have terms like \\(\\binom{4}{k} a^{4 - k} b^k\\) for k from 0 to 4.\n\nI'm interested in the term where \\(a^2b^2\\). So, I need to find the value of k such that \\(a^{4 - k}b^k = a^2b^2\\). That means \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\binom{4}{2}\\).\n\nCalculating that, \\(\\binom{4}{2} = \\frac{4!}{2!2!} = \\frac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\nNow, moving on to the second part: \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I wonder if I need to expand this as well. But wait, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve c. So, maybe the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just 6 times the coefficient from the second part when considering the variables a and b. But since the second part doesn't involve a or b, maybe it just gets multiplied by 1. Hmm, that seems confusing.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When you multiply two expressions, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the coefficient of any term in the second part that doesn't involve a or b. But since the second part only has c terms, which are separate from a and b, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is just 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part. Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by \\(c^0\\), you still get \\(a^2b^2\\).\n\nWait, that makes sense. So, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because that's the only term that won't affect the a and b terms. So, let me calculate that.\n\nUsing the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) can be expanded as \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\binom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying that, each term becomes \\(\\binom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m} = \\binom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\).\n\nWe want the term where the exponent of c is 0, so we set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for m, we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(\\binom{6}{3}\\).\n\nCalculating that, \\(\\binom{6}{3} = \\frac{6!}{3!3!} = \\frac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\frac{720}{36} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficients from both parts, which is 6 times 20. That equals 120.\n\nWait, let me double-check that. So, the first part gives 6 for \\(a^2b^2\\), and the second part gives 20 for \\(c^0\\). Since these terms are multiplied together in the expansion, the overall coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120. Yeah, that seems right.\n\nI think that's the answer. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we start by considering each part separately.\n\nFirst, we use the binomial theorem to expand \\((a + b)^4\\).

So, maybe I can apply that here.\n\nLooking at the given problem, the expression is a product of two binomials raised to powers: \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, maybe I can expand each part separately and then multiply them together. But I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, but the second part involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), which aren't present in \\(a^2b^2\\). So, perhaps I don't need to worry about the \\(c\\) terms when looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Let me think.\n\nActually, since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are independent of the terms involving \\(c\\). So, when I multiply the two expansions together, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will come from the product of the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in \\((a + b)^4\\) and the constant term (i.e., the term with no \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\)) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Is that right?\n\nWait, let me make sure. So, if I have \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), then each term in the expansion will be of the form \\(a^k b^{4 - k} c^m \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^n\\), where \\(k\\) and \\(m\\) are exponents such that \\(k + (4 - k) = 4\\) for the first part, and \\(m + n = 6\\) for the second part. But since I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I need the term where \\(k = 2\\) and \\(4 - k = 2\\), so \\(a^2b^2\\). But this term will be multiplied by some term from the second expansion. However, since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), the coefficient I'm looking for is the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) (i.e., the constant term) in the second expansion. That makes sense because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by \\(c^0\\), you just get \\(a^2b^2\\), which is the term we're interested in.\n\nSo, first, let's find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\). Using the binomial theorem, the general term is \\(\\binom{4}{k} a^{4 - k} b^{k}\\). We want the term where \\(a^2b^2\\), so that would be when \\(4 - k = 2\\), so \\(k = 2\\). So, the coefficient is \\(\\binom{4}{2}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\binom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6.\n\nNext, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Again, using the binomial theorem, the general term is \\(\\binom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\binom{6}{m} c^{6 - m - m} = \\binom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We want the exponent of \\(c\\) to be 0, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(\\binom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\binom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20.\n\nNow, since the two expansions are multiplied together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the two coefficients we just found. That is, 6 multiplied by 20. Calculating that, 6 \u00d7 20 = 120.\n\nWait, let me just double-check to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. So, for the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed \\(\\binom{4}{2} = 6\\). For the second part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the constant term is when \\(m = 3\\), so \\(\\binom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying these together, 6 \u00d7 20 = 120. That seems correct.\n\nI don't think I made any calculation errors here. The logic is that since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are independent variables, the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) don't interact with those involving \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient we're seeking is just the product of the coefficients from each expansion. Yeah, that makes sense.\n\nSo, the final answer should be 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem.\n\nFirst, we expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem.

So, the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) occurs would be when \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). Let me check that: if \\(k = 2\\), then \\(4 - 2 = 2\\), so the term is \\(\\binom{4}{2} a^2 b^2\\).

Because \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) doesn't involve a or b, it's only in terms of c.

Let me think again. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, which would include all possible terms from the product of the two expansions. But \\(a^2b^2\\) is only from \\((a + b)^4\\), and the other part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), contributes terms involving c. So, when you multiply them together, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by every term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nWait, but the sum of all coefficients in a polynomial is found by plugging in 1 for all variables. So, the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) would be when c = 1, which gives \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times 64, which is 384.\n\nBut wait, that seems too straightforward. Let me check if that's correct. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Since \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from \\((a + b)^4\\), and the other part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), when expanded, has multiple terms, each of which is a coefficient times \\(c^k\\) for some k. So, when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each of these terms, each will contribute a term of the form (coefficient) * \\(a^2b^2c^k\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is indeed 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me make sure. Alternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the c terms, meaning that the term \\(a^2b^2\\) can be multiplied by any power of c, so the coefficient would just be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which would mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times 64, which is 384.\n\nWait, but maybe I'm misinterpreting the question. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, in the product, each term is a product of a term from \\((a + b)^4\\) and a term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).

Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is considering only the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by a specific term from the other expansion, but that doesn't seem to be the case. The problem just asks for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so it's considering all terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) appears, regardless of the c terms. Therefore, the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion, which is 64, giving 384.\n\nWait, but let me think differently. Maybe I'm supposed to consider the entire product as a polynomial in a, b, c, and find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would involve all possible terms where a^2b^2 is multiplied by any term from the other expansion. So, yes, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients from the other expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but another thought: perhaps the problem is more about the product of the two expansions, and the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is present only in the first expansion, so when multiplied by the second expansion, each term in the second expansion contributes to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should compute the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion, which is 6, and then realize that in the product, this term is multiplied by every term from the second expansion, so the overall coefficient would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients from the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me compute the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) more carefully. The sum of coefficients is found by setting c = 1, so \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\), so that part is correct.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me check if that's correct by expanding both parts.\n\nFirst, \\((a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6.\n\nNext, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let's expand this using the binomial theorem: \\(\\sum_{k=0}^6 \\binom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^6 \\binom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\).\n\nSo, the expansion is: \\(c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15c^{-2} + 6c^{-4} + c^{-6}\\). The sum of the coefficients here is indeed 1 + 6 + 15 + 20 + 15 + 6 + 1 = 64.\n\nTherefore, when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but another approach: perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning that we are looking for the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\). Is that possible? Because in the product, each term would have a combination of a, b, and c exponents. So, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then we need to find the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by the term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) that has \\(c^0\\), which is the constant term.\n\nIn that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, let me check what the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nFrom the expansion earlier, the constant term is 20, so the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product would be 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but the problem didn't specify anything about c, it just asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, perhaps the initial interpretation was correct, that it's 384, but maybe the problem is expecting 120 because it's considering the term where c^0 is present.\n\nWait, let me check the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" It doesn't specify any condition on c, so it's just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the c terms. Therefore, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nBut wait, if the problem had specified a particular power of c, like \\(c^0\\), then it would be 120. Since it didn't, I think 384 is the correct answer.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think again: when you have two polynomials multiplied together, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each polynomial. But in this case, \\(a^2b^2\\) is only present in the first polynomial, so when you multiply by the second polynomial, each term in the second polynomial will contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So, I think the correct answer is 384.\n\nWait, but to make sure, let me compute the product step by step.\n\nFirst, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\nThe sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by substituting c = 1, which gives 2^6 = 64.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nWait, but let me think differently. Suppose I expand both parts and look for the term \\(a^2b^2\\). Since the second part doesn't involve a or b, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will only come from the first part, and it will be multiplied by every term in the second part. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, if I were to write the entire product as a sum of terms, each term would be a product of a term from the first expansion and a term from the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion would be multiplied by each term from the second expansion, each contributing a coefficient. Therefore, the total coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) across all terms in the product would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nYes, that's consistent.\n\nWait, but maybe I should compute the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) to see if it's 120, as I thought earlier. Let me check that.\n\nIn \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term with \\(c^0\\) is when the exponent is 0. The general term is \\(\\binom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, 6 - 2k = 0 implies k = 3. The coefficient is \\(\\binom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, the term is 20c^0.\n\nTherefore, in the product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion is multiplied by 20c^0 from the second expansion, giving a term of 6 * 20 * \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), so the coefficient is 120.\n\nBut wait, the problem didn't specify c^0, so if it's just asking for \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of c's power, then the coefficient would be 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without any c terms, meaning \\(c^0\\). In that case, the coefficient would be 120.\n\nBut the problem statement is: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" It doesn't specify anything about c, so it's just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the c terms. Therefore, the coefficient would be 384.\n\nWait, but perhaps I should think of it as a polynomial in a, b, and c, and find the coefficient of the term \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for any k. But the problem just says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", which might mean that it's considering the term \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by any power of c. So, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem had asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), it would be 120, but since it didn't specify c^0, it's 384.\n\nWait, but let me check the problem again. It says: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\"\n\nSo, in the product, each term is a product of a term from \\((a + b)^4\\) and a term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from \\((a + b)^4\\), and when multiplied by each term from the second expansion, which includes different powers of c, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by 6.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nWait, but let me make sure by another approach. Let's compute the product:\n\n\\((a + b)^4 = 6a^2b^2 + \\text{other terms}\\).\n\n\\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = 64 + \\text{other terms}\\).\n\nSo, when you multiply them, the term \\(6a^2b^2 * 64\\) will be part of the product, but also \\(6a^2b^2\\) multiplied by other terms. But wait, no, that's not quite right. Actually, the product would be the sum over all possible combinations, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the sum of the coefficients from the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nYes, that makes sense.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given product is 384.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{384}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem and properties of polynomial multiplication.\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\binom{4}{k} a^{4 - k} b^k\n   \\]\n   The term containing \\(a^2b^2\\) occurs when \\(k = 2\\):\n   \\[\n   \\binom{4}{2} a^2 b^2 = 6 a^2 b^2\n   \\]\n   Thus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\n2. **Consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   The sum of all coefficients in this expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\):\n   \\[\n   \\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\n   \\]\n\n3. **Combine the results:**\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) from \\((a + b)^4\\) and the sum of all coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 64 = 384\n   \\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{384}\\)."

    "text": " Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I remember that when expanding expressions like \\((a + b)^n\\), we can use the binomial theorem. The binomial theorem states that \\((a + b)^n = \\sum_{k=0}^{n} \\binom{n}{k} a^{n - k} b^k\\). So, maybe I can apply this theorem to both parts of the given expression separately.\n\nLet me start with the first part: \\((a + b)^4\\). Using the binomial theorem, this expansion will have terms like \\(\\binom{4}{k} a^{4 - k} b^k\\) for \\(k = 0\\) to \\(4\\). Since we're interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I need to find the term where \\(a\\) is squared and \\(b\\) is also squared. That means \\(4 - k = 2\\) for \\(a\\), so \\(k = 2\\). Therefore, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in this part is \\(\\binom{4}{2}\\).\n\nCalculating \\(\\binom{4}{2}\\), that's \\(\\frac{4!}{2!2!} = \\frac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient is 6. But wait, I think I need to consider the entire expression, which also includes \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Hmm, does that affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)? Let me think.\n\nSince the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and the other part of the expression involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), those variables are independent of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). So, when multiplying the two expansions together, the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) will multiply with terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). However, since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), the other variables \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) can take any values because they don't affect the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. \n\nWait, but actually, no. When you multiply two expressions together, each term from the first expression multiplies each term from the second expression. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will multiply every term from the second part. But since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\), the coefficient will be the same as the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. But that doesn't make sense because the coefficient should just be the same as the coefficient from the first part, since the second part doesn't affect \\(a\\) and \\(b\\).\n\nWait, no, that's not quite right. Let me clarify. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) is a specific term in the first expansion. When we multiply it by each term in the second expansion, each of those products will have \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by different powers of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not any specific power of \\(c\\). So, in other words, we're looking for all terms in the product where the variables \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are squared, regardless of the power of \\(c\\). \n\nBut wait, that's not possible because in the product, each term will have some combination of \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\), and \\(1/c\\). So, actually, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, each of which has different powers of \\(c\\). But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would mean that we're considering the entire coefficient when \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any term from the second expansion. But that would mean the coefficient is actually the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the entire second expansion. But that can't be right because the coefficient should be a numerical value, not an expression.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of the term that has \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by any combination of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). But that would mean that the coefficient is the same as the coefficient from the first part, because the second part doesn't affect \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). So, the coefficient would just be 6, as we found earlier, because the second part's expansion doesn't influence the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms.\n\nWait, but that seems too straightforward. Maybe I'm missing something. Let me think again. The entire expression is the product of two expansions: one in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and another in \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, when you multiply them, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. Therefore, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, each of which is a different power of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would actually be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion multiplied by the entire second expansion. But that doesn't make sense because the coefficient should be a single number, not a polynomial.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some specific \\(k\\). But it's not specified, so maybe it's just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). But in that case, the coefficient would indeed just be 6, because the second part doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. However, I'm not entirely sure. Maybe I should consider that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, which would include all the possible combinations with \\(c\\). But that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the entire second expansion, which is not a number. So, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by a specific power of \\(c\\), but since it's not specified, maybe it's just 6.\n\nWait, but that seems off. Let me think differently. Maybe the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, considering that the other terms involve \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, in the product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire second expansion. But that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all terms in the second expansion, which is not a single number.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me check the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient would be the same as the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, because the second part doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. Therefore, the coefficient is 6.\n\nBut wait, that seems too simple. Maybe I should think about it as the product of two independent expansions. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first expansion, and it can be multiplied by any term from the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion.\n\nWait, that makes more sense. Because each term in the second expansion has its own coefficient, and when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), those coefficients contribute to the overall coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient from the first part (6) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part.\n\nSo, to find the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), I can set \\(c = 1\\) because substituting \\(c = 1\\) will make each term equal to its coefficient. So, substituting \\(c = 1\\), we get \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion is 64.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\nWait, but let me make sure. If I have two expansions, \\(A = (a + b)^4\\) and \\(B = \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), then the product \\(A \\times B\\) will have terms like \\(a^kb^{4 - k} \\times c^m (1/c)^n\\). The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the sum over all \\(k, m, n\\) such that \\(a^2b^2\\) is obtained, which is when \\(k = 2\\) and \\(4 - k = 2\\), so \\(k = 2\\). But in the second expansion, \\(c^m (1/c)^n\\) can be any term, so the coefficient would be the coefficient from the first part (6) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients from the second part (64), giving 384.\n\nAlternatively, if I think about it as the product of two polynomials, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient from the first polynomial times the sum of all coefficients from the second polynomial, because each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second, and we're only interested in the terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. Therefore, the coefficient is indeed 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me verify this with a smaller example to make sure I'm not making a mistake. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Let's compute the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, but in this case, \\((a + b)^2\\) has \\(a^2b^0\\), \\(2a^1b^1\\), and \\(b^2\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^0\\) is 1, \\(a^1b^1\\) is 2, and \\(b^2\\) is 1. But in this case, \\((c + 1/c)^1\\) is \\(c + 1/c\\). So, the product would be \\((a^2 + 2ab + b^2)(c + 1/c)\\). The term \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't exist in this product because the highest power of \\(a\\) is 2, but to get \\(a^2b^2\\), we would need to multiply \\(a^2\\) by \\(b^2\\), but in the first expansion, the only \\(a^2\\) term is 1, and the only \\(b^2\\) term is 1. So, in the product, \\(a^2 \\times b^2\\) would be \\(a^2b^2\\), but in the product, \\(a^2\\) is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, so \\(a^2c\\) and \\(a^2(1/c)\\). Similarly, \\(b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would only come from \\(a^2 \\times b^2\\), but in the product, \\(a^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), so \\(a^2c\\) and \\(a^2(1/c)\\). Similarly, \\(b^2c\\) and \\(b^2(1/c)\\). Therefore, there is no term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product because \\(a^2\\) and \\(b^2\\) are multiplied by different powers of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in this case would be zero.\n\nWait, that contradicts my earlier reasoning. So, in this smaller example, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is zero, not 1 * (sum of coefficients in second expansion). Hmm, so that suggests that my earlier reasoning is incorrect.\n\nWait, but in this smaller example, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is zero because you can't get \\(a^2b^2\\) by multiplying terms from the two expansions. Because \\(a^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), and \\(b^2\\) is also multiplied by \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), but there's no way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) without involving \\(c\\). So, in the product, all terms have either \\(a^2c\\), \\(a^2(1/c)\\), \\(b^2c\\), or \\(b^2(1/c)\\), but none have both \\(a^2\\) and \\(b^2\\) multiplied together without \\(c\\) terms. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is zero.\n\nWait, so that suggests that in the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is zero because you can't get \\(a^2b^2\\) without involving \\(c\\) terms. But that contradicts my earlier reasoning where I thought it was 384. So, where is the mistake?\n\nI think the confusion arises because in the original problem, we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). But in reality, in the product, each term will have some combination of \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\), and \\(1/c\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would only appear if there's a term in the product that has exactly \\(a^2b^2\\) and any power of \\(c\\). But in the product, to get \\(a^2b^2\\), you would need to multiply a term from the first expansion with \\(a^2b^2\\) by a term from the second expansion that is 1, because if you multiply by \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), you'd get \\(a^2b^2c\\) or \\(a^2b^2(1/c)\\), not just \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) is if you multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first expansion by the constant term (i.e., the term with \\(c^0\\)) from the second expansion.\n\nWait, that makes sense. So, in the second expansion, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the constant term (i.e., the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero) is the term where \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) are raised to powers that cancel each other out. So, in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the general term is \\(\\binom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(1/c\\right)^k = \\binom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be zero, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\binom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n\nTherefore, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion will multiply the constant term (20) from the second expansion, resulting in \\(a^2b^2 \\times 20\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 (from the first expansion) multiplied by 20 (the constant term from the second expansion), giving \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nWait, that makes more sense now. So, in the smaller example I tried earlier, where \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\), the constant term in the second expansion is 0 because when \\(k = 0.5\\), which is not an integer, so there's no constant term. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is zero, which matches my earlier result.\n\nSo, applying this to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the product of the coefficient from the first expansion (6) and the constant term from the second expansion (20), giving \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was 384, which was the coefficient from the first expansion multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. But now I realize that was incorrect because the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion includes terms with \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), which would change the power of \\(c\\). Therefore, to get \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms, we need to multiply by the constant term in the second expansion.\n\nTherefore, the correct coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but let me verify this again. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion is 6. The term that doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\) in the second expansion is the constant term, which is 20. So, when you multiply these two, you get 6 * 20 = 120, which is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product.\n\nYes, that seems correct now. So, the coefficient is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by multiplying the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, by the constant term in the second part, which is 20. Therefore, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n$\\boxed{120}$"

    "text": " Hmm, that seems a bit involved, but let me break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that when dealing with expressions raised to powers, the binomial theorem is really useful. The binomial theorem says that \\((x + y)^n = \\sum_{k=0}^{n} \\binom{n}{k} x^{n - k} y^{k}\\). So, I can apply this to both parts of the given expression: \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nStarting with the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\). Using the binomial theorem, this expands to:\n\n\\[\n\\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\binom{4}{k} a^{4 - k} b^{k}\n\\]\n\nI need the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, I should find the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) occurs. That happens when \\(4 - k = 2\\) for \\(a\\), which implies \\(k = 2\\). So, the coefficient is \\(\\binom{4}{2}\\).\n\nCalculating that, \\(\\binom{4}{2} = \\frac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\\). So, the coefficient from the first part is 6.\n\nNow, moving on to the second part: \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Again, using the binomial theorem, this expands to:\n\n\\[\n\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\binom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^{m}\n\\]\n\nSimplifying the exponents, that becomes:\n\n\\[\n\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\binom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m} = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\binom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n\\]\n\nSo, each term in this expansion is \\(\\binom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\).\n\nNow, the original problem is the product of these two expansions. So, when I multiply them together, I'll be combining terms from both expansions. The entire expression is:\n\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\left( \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\binom{4}{k} a^{4 - k} b^{k} \\right) \\times \\left( \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\binom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m} \\right)\n\\]\n\nSince the variables in the first part (a and b) are different from the variables in the second part (c and 1/c), when I multiply these two sums, the terms will be multiplied across. However, the problem asks specifically for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). \n\nWait, hold on. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) is only present in the first expansion, right? The second expansion only involves c and 1/c, so when multiplied together, the variables a and b are only from the first part, and c terms are from the second. Therefore, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be multiplied by every term from the second expansion. But the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would actually be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion multiplied by the entire second expansion, because \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve c. Wait, but that can't be right because the problem is asking for the coefficient in the product, which would include all possible c terms.\n\nWait, maybe I misread the problem. Let me check again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, in the product, we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the c terms. But that doesn't make much sense because in the product, each term will have both a and b variables and c variables. So, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by some power of c? Or maybe it's a typo, but I think more likely, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, treating c as a separate variable. So, actually, the coefficient would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times the entire expansion of the second part. But that would make the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) equal to 6 times the entire second expansion, which is a polynomial in c. But that seems odd because the problem is phrased as asking for a single coefficient, not a polynomial.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so in the product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would come from the first expansion, and when multiplied by the second expansion, it would be \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But since the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), perhaps it's considering all the terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present, regardless of the c terms. So, the coefficient would be 6 times the entire second expansion, meaning that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't make sense because the coefficient should be a numerical factor, not a polynomial in c.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Perhaps it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating c as a separate variable, so the coefficient would actually be a polynomial in c. But the problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", which usually refers to the numerical coefficient, but in this case, since there are multiple variables, it's a bit ambiguous. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the entire expression as a polynomial in a, b, c, and 1/c, and it's asking for the coefficient of the monomial \\(a^2b^2\\), which would include all possible c terms. So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial. But that seems too involved, and the problem is likely expecting a numerical coefficient.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Let me look at the problem again: it says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\". So, in the product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first part, which is 6, and then it's multiplied by the entire second part, which is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually be 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that's a polynomial, not a single number. So, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when considering the entire expansion, but only the numerical coefficient, not considering the c terms. But that doesn't make much sense because the c terms are separate variables.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times some specific power of c, but it's not specified. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is miswritten, and it's supposed to be \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), and it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where c cancels out to c^0. That would make sense because then we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by c^0, which is 1. So, the term would be \\(6 \\times \\text{coefficient of } c^0 \\text{ in } \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\).\n\nThat seems plausible. So, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times c^0. So, in that case, I need to compute the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and then multiply it by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part, which is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\).\n\nSo, let's compute the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem again, the expansion is:\n\n\\[\n\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\binom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(1/c\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\binom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n\\]\n\nWe need the exponent of c to be 0, so we set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which gives \\(m = 3\\). So, the coefficient is \\(\\binom{6}{3}\\).\n\nCalculating that, \\(\\binom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20.\n\nNow, going back to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product is the product of the coefficients from each part, which is 6 (from \\(a^2b^2\\)) multiplied by 20 (from \\(c^0\\)), giving 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but the problem didn't specify \\(c^0\\), it just asked for \\(a^2b^2\\). So, maybe I'm overcomplicating again. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the c terms, which would be 6 times the entire \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but that would make the coefficient a polynomial, not a single number. So, I think the more likely scenario is that the problem intended to ask for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating c as a separate variable, so the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but that doesn't make sense because coefficients are numerical factors, not polynomials. So, perhaps the problem is expecting just the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, and ignoring the c terms. But that seems unlikely because the problem includes both parts.\n\nWait, maybe I should consider that the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is independent of c, so in the product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, but the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the c terms. But that's not standard. Typically, when you're asked for the coefficient of a specific term in a product, you're looking for the coefficient when considering all variables. So, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), which would be 120.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating c as a separate variable, so the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that seems odd because coefficients are usually numerical, not polynomials. So, perhaps the problem is expecting just the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, but that seems too simple.\n\nWait, let me check the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, in the product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is present, but it's multiplied by terms from the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually be the coefficient from the first part times the entire second expansion. But that would mean the coefficient is 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial. So, perhaps the problem is expecting the coefficient in terms of the product, meaning that the coefficient is 6 times the expansion, but that's not a single number.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the entire expansion and looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times any power of c, so the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 2^6 = 6 * 64 = 384. But that seems too high, and I don't think that's what's intended.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think differently. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so in the product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first part, which is 6, and then it's multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the entire second expansion. But that's not a single number. Therefore, perhaps the problem is expecting just the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, but that seems too simplistic.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, regardless of the c terms, meaning that it's 6 times the entire second expansion. But that's not a single number, so perhaps the problem is expecting the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be 120, as I calculated earlier.\n\nGiven that, I think the problem is likely asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. So, the answer is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is found by considering both parts of the expansion. From \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. From \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Multiplying these gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\boxed{120}"

    "text": " Hmm, okay, let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I know that when expanding expressions like \\((a + b)^n\\), we can use the binomial theorem. The binomial theorem states that \\((a + b)^n = \\sum_{k=0}^{n} \\binom{n}{k} a^{n - k} b^k\\). So, for \\((a + b)^4\\), the expansion would be \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\binom{4}{k} a^{4 - k} b^k\\).\n\nNow, I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). That means I need to find the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2. In the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\), the term with \\(a^2b^2\\) occurs when \\(k = 2\\) because \\(a^{4 - 2}b^2 = a^2b^2\\).\n\nSo, the coefficient for this term is \\(\\binom{4}{2}\\). Let me calculate that. \\(\\binom{4}{2} = \\frac{4!}{2!2!} = \\frac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient from the \\((a + b)^4\\) part is 6.\n\nNow, the other part of the expression is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I notice that this part doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), so when I multiply the two expansions together, each term in the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. However, since I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I don't need to consider the terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) because they won't affect the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. Instead, I just need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and then multiply it by the entire second part, since the second part is independent of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\).\n\nWait, no, actually, that's not quite right. Because when we multiply two expressions, each term from the first is multiplied by each term from the second. But since \\(a^2b^2\\) is only in the first part, the second part's expansion will contribute a factor that gets multiplied by 1 (since there's no \\(a\\) or \\(b\\) in the second part). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. But wait, that doesn't make sense because the second part is a separate expression, so when we multiply, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But since we're only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), the term from the second expansion must be the constant term, i.e., the term where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out, so that when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), it remains as \\(a^2b^2\\) times that constant.\n\nWait, let me clarify. When I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), we need to consider all terms in the second expansion that, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), don't change the \\(a^2b^2\\) part. That is, they must be constants or terms that don't involve \\(c\\), but since the second expansion only has \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), the only way for the product to have \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms is if the second factor contributes a term where \\(c^k \\cdot (1/c)^m\\) equals \\(c^0\\), i.e., \\(k = m\\), so that the exponent is zero.\n\nWait, but actually, the second expansion is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), so when we multiply, each term from the first expansion is multiplied by each term from the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), we need to sum all the products where the second term is a constant, i.e., where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. Because if the second term has a non-zero exponent of \\(c\\), then the product will have \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or similar, which isn't what we're looking for. So, we need to find the constant term in the second expansion and then multiply it by the coefficient from the first expansion.\n\nSo, to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem again. The expansion is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\binom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(1/c\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\binom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\).\n\nWe need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be zero, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\binom{6}{3}\\).\n\nCalculating that, \\(\\binom{6}{3} = \\frac{6!}{3!3!} = \\frac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\frac{720}{36} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20.\n\nNow, going back to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficient from the first expansion and the constant term from the second expansion. So, that's \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nWait, but let me double-check that. So, the first part's coefficient is 6, and the second part's constant term is 20. Multiplying them together gives 120. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 120.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of it as the entire expression being the product of two independent expansions, so when we multiply them, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed the product of the coefficients from each part, provided that the second part contributes a constant term. So, yes, that makes sense.\n\nWait, but another way to think about it is that when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficients multiply for the terms that don't interfere with each other. Since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are independent of those involving \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire second expansion's constant term, because any other term from the second expansion would introduce \\(c\\) terms, which we don't want. So, yeah, that's consistent.\n\nLet me just recap to make sure I didn't miss anything. The problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). \n\n1. Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\binom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n\n2. Expand \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem. The constant term (where exponent of \\(c\\) is zero) occurs when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), so \\(m = 3\\). The coefficient is \\(\\binom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n\n3. Multiply these two coefficients together because the terms are independent, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nI think that's correct. I don't see any mistakes in the calculations or the logic. So, the final answer should be 120.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break the problem into two parts using the binomial theorem.\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\):**\n   Using the binomial theorem, the term with \\(a^2b^2\\) occurs when \\(k = 2\\):\n   \\[\n   \\binom{4}{2} a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\n   \\]\n   So, the coefficient from this part is 6.\n\n2. **Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   We need the constant term (where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero).

Hmm, maybe I should clarify that. Let me read the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a+b)^4\\left(c+\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, perhaps the question is considering \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. But that doesn't make much sense because the entire expression is a product, so \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by some terms involving \\(c\\). Maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, so that it's just \\(a^2b^2\\) times some coefficient. Alternatively, maybe it's just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, without considering the \\(c\\) terms, but that seems odd because the expression is a product of two polynomials. So, perhaps I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when considering the entire expansion, but that would involve an infinite number of terms because of the \\(c\\) terms. Hmm, maybe the problem is intended to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would make sense. So, I think that's the right approach: to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is the term where \\(a\\) is squared, \\(b\\) is squared, and \\(c\\) has an exponent of zero, meaning that \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) terms have canceled each other out.\n\nOkay, so let's start by expanding each part separately and then find the appropriate terms that multiply together to give \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). So, first, let's expand \\((a + b)^4\\). I can use the binomial theorem for this. The binomial theorem states that \\((x + y)^n = \\sum_{k=0}^{n} \\binom{n}{k} x^{n - k} y^k\\). So, applying this to \\((a + b)^4\\), we get:\n\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\binom{4}{k} a^{4 - k} b^k\n\\]\n\nWe are interested in the term where \\(a^2b^2\\), so let's find the value of \\(k\\) that gives \\(b^2\\). Since \\(b^k = b^2\\), \\(k = 2\\). So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\binom{4}{2}\\).\n\nCalculating that, \\(\\binom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\nNow, moving on to the second part: \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Again, I'll use the binomial theorem here. Let me write it out:\n\n\\[\n\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\binom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\n\\]\n\nSimplifying the exponents, we have:\n\n\\[\n\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\binom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m} = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\binom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n\\]\n\nWe need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero because we want \\(c^0\\) when multiplying by the other part. So, set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\):\n\n\\[\n6 - 2m = 0 \\implies 2m = 6 \\implies m = 3\n\\]\n\nSo, the term where \\(m = 3\\) will give us \\(c^0\\). The coefficient for this term is \\(\\binom{6}{3}\\).\n\nCalculating that, \\(\\binom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20.\n\nNow, since the original expression is the product of \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is obtained by multiplying the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion with the term \\(c^0\\) from the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient is the product of the two coefficients we found: 6 and 20.\n\nSo, multiplying them together: \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nWait, but just to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Let me double-check each step.\n\nFirst, for \\((a + b)^4\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed at \\(k = 2\\), so the binomial coefficient is \\(\\binom{4}{2} = 6\\). That seems correct.\n\nThen, for \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term with \\(c^0\\) occurs when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), so \\(m = 3\\), and the binomial coefficient is \\(\\binom{6}{3} = 20\\). That also checks out.\n\nMultiplying 6 and 20 gives 120, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is 120. Therefore, the answer should be 120.\n\nWait, but let me think again: the problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\". If we're only considering \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, then perhaps we need to consider all possible terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any power of \\(c\\). But that would mean the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But that doesn't make much sense because \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\). So, perhaps the problem is indeed asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\), i.e., 1. So, that would make the coefficient 120. Alternatively, if the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, without considering \\(c\\), that would be 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that would result in a polynomial where the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the sum of all terms in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is not a single number. So, that interpretation doesn't make sense. Therefore, the correct interpretation is that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nJust to make sure, let me think about how the product would look. The product is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a product of two polynomials. So, when you multiply them, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part, which includes terms like \\(c^6\\), \\(6c^4\\), \\(15c^2\\), \\(20\\), \\(15c^{-2}\\), \\(6c^{-4}\\), and \\(c^{-6}\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by each of these, resulting in terms like \\(6a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(36a^2b^2c^4\\), etc. But if we are only interested in the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, that's when \\(c^0\\), which is the term \\(20a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient is 20 times 6, which is 120.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So, I think I've arrived at the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we proceed as follows:\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\binom{4}{k} a^{4 - k} b^k\n   \\]\n   The term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\):\n   \\[\n   \\binom{4}{2} a^2 b^2 = 6 a^2 b^2\n   \\]\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6.\n\n2. **Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\binom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\binom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n   \\]\n   The term with \\(c^0\\) occurs when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which gives \\(m = 3\\):\n   \\[\n   \\binom{6}{3} c^0 = 20\n   \\]\n   The coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20.\n\n3. **Multiply the coefficients from both expansions:**\n   The term \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is obtained by multiplying the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion with the term \\(c^0\\) from the second expansion:\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 20 = 120\n   \\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

    "text": " Wait, but hold on, the problem is about \\(a^2b^2\\), but the second part of the product involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). Hmm, maybe I'm supposed to consider all the terms, but perhaps the variables are separate? Let me think.\n\nSo, the expression is \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Since these are two separate binomials, maybe the coefficients from each part can be considered independently? Because \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) don't mix with \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), right? So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), and the coefficient of some term in the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but since we're just looking for \\(a^2b^2\\), maybe the second part can be treated separately, and perhaps we just need to multiply the coefficients together.\n\nWait, but actually, when you multiply two expressions, the terms combine. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by every term in the second expansion. But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but the second part doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), maybe the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part? Or maybe it's more nuanced.\n\nWait, let me clarify. The entire expression is a product of two polynomials: one in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the other in \\(c\\). So, when you expand the product, each term will be a product of a term from the first polynomial and a term from the second. So, for example, a term like \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, which could be \\(c^6\\), \\(c^5\\), ..., up to \\(c^0\\) or \\(c^{-6}\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). Wait, but that doesn't make sense because each term will have both \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) parts and \\(c\\) parts.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Perhaps the question is actually to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\) (i.e., the constant term in \\(c\\)). Because otherwise, if we just consider \\(a^2b^2\\), it would be multiplied by all possible powers of \\(c\\), which would make the coefficient a sum of all the coefficients from the second expansion. But that seems a bit strange because the problem didn't specify anything about \\(c\\). Hmm.\n\nWait, let me check the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, it's just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, perhaps that means we can treat the two parts separately and then multiply their coefficients. Because when you multiply the two expansions, each term in the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part.\n\nWait, but that would mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But let me think again.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\), so the constant term in \\(c\\). That would make more sense, as it's a specific term. But the problem didn't specify \\(c^0\\), so maybe I'm overcomplicating.\n\nWait, maybe I should proceed step by step. First, find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), then find the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), and then multiply them together.\n\nBut let me check: if I have two polynomials, P(a, b) and Q(c), then the product P(a, b) * Q(c) will have terms where each term of P is multiplied by each term of Q. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in P(a, b) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in Q(c), because each term in Q(c) would multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term, contributing to the coefficient.\n\nWait, that makes sense. So, for example, if P(a, b) = ... + k * a^2b^2 + ..., and Q(c) = ... + m * c^k + ..., then the product would have terms like k * m * a^2b^2c^k. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of c would be k multiplied by the sum of all m's, because each m is a coefficient for some c term, and when multiplied by a^2b^2, it contributes to the coefficient of a^2b^2 in the product.\n\nWait, but that seems a bit off because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would include all possible c terms. But maybe that's the case. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only considering terms where the powers of c cancel out, i.e., c^0, so that the term is just \\(a^2b^2\\). That would make more sense, but the problem didn't specify, so I'm not sure.\n\nWait, let's try both approaches and see which one makes sense.\n\nFirst approach: The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nSecond approach: The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product, which would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nHmm. Let me see which one is more plausible. Since the problem is just asking for \\(a^2b^2\\), without any c terms, maybe it's the first approach, but I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only considering the terms where the exponents of c are zero, so that the overall term is \\(a^2b^2\\). Let me try both.\n\nFirst, let's find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\). Using the binomial theorem, the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is the sum from k=0 to 4 of C(4, k) * a^{4 - k} * b^k. So, the term where a^2b^2 occurs is when 4 - k = 2 and k = 2, so the coefficient is C(4, 2) = 6.\n\nNext, let's find the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). To find the sum of all coefficients, we can substitute c = 1, which gives us (1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64.\n\nTherefore, if we take the first approach, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, if we take the second approach, we need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem again, the expansion is the sum from m=0 to 6 of C(6, m) * c^{6 - m} * (1/c)^m = C(6, m) * c^{6 - 2m}. We want the exponent of c to be 0, so 6 - 2m = 0 => m = 3. The coefficient is C(6, 3) = 20.\n\nThen, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) would be 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nNow, I need to figure out which interpretation is correct. The problem says, \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)\". So, if we're considering the entire expression, which includes c terms, then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would include all terms where the exponents of c are anything, so the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which is 64, giving 384.\n\nBut alternatively, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is just \\(a^2b^2\\), then it's 120.\n\nWait, but the problem didn't specify anything about c, so perhaps the intended interpretation is the first one, where the coefficient is 384. But I'm a bit unsure because sometimes when variables are not mentioned, they might be considered as constants, but in this case, the problem is about a coefficient, so it's more likely that they want the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of c, which would be 384.\n\nWait, but let me check again. If I expand \\((a + b)^4\\), I get terms up to \\(a^4b^0\\) and \\(a^0b^4\\). Then, when I multiply by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part would be multiplied by each term in the second part, which has terms like \\(c^6\\), \\(c^5\\), down to \\(c^{-6}\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would indeed be 6 (the coefficient from the first part) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which is 64, giving 384.\n\nBut wait, another way to think about it is that when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum of the products of coefficients of terms whose variables multiply to that specific term. So, for \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of c, each term in the first polynomial is \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. Therefore, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 64, giving 384.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem had asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it's 6 times 20, which is 120. But since it's just \\(a^2b^2\\), I think it's 384.\n\nWait, but let me think again. If I have two polynomials P(a, b) and Q(c), then the product P(a, b) * Q(c) will have terms like \\(a^kb^lc^m\\), etc. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in P(a, b) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in Q(c), because each term in Q(c) is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), contributing to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product.\n\nWait, that seems correct. So, the sum of all coefficients in Q(c) is Q(1) = (1 + 1)^6 = 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nBut to confirm, let me consider a simpler example. Suppose I have (a + b)^1 * (c + 1/c)^1. The coefficient of \\(a^1b^0\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^1b^0\\) in (a + b), which is 1, multiplied by the sum of coefficients in (c + 1/c), which is 2. So, the coefficient would be 2. Alternatively, if I look for \\(a^1b^0c^0\\), it would be 1 * 2 choose 1, which is 2, but that's not the case here because in (c + 1/c)^1, the coefficient of c^0 is zero because you can't get c^0 from c + 1/c unless you have an even power. Wait, no, in (c + 1/c)^1, you have c and 1/c, so no c^0 term. So, the coefficient of \\(a^1b^0c^0\\) would be zero. But the coefficient of \\(a^1b^0\\) regardless of c would be 1 * (1 + 1) = 2.\n\nSo, in that case, the coefficient of \\(a^1b^0\\) in the product is 2, which is the coefficient in the first part times the sum of coefficients in the second part.\n\nTherefore, applying that to our problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but in the simpler example, if I look for \\(a^1b^0c^1\\), that would be 1 * 1 = 1, and \\(a^1b^0c^{-1}\\) would be 1 * 1 = 1. So, the total coefficient of \\(a^1b^0\\) is 2, which is 1 * (1 + 1) = 2. So, that seems consistent.\n\nTherefore, in our problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would indeed be 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. Let me try another approach.\n\nLet me consider the entire expansion. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), and it's multiplied by every term from the second part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Because each term in the second part is a coefficient times some power of c, and when you multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), you just get \\(a^2b^2\\) times that coefficient, so the total coefficient is the product of the two coefficients summed over all terms in the second part. But the sum of all coefficients in the second part is just the value when c = 1, which is 2^6 = 64.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought maybe it's 120, which is if we were looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). So, which is it?\n\nI think the problem is ambiguous, but given the wording, it's more likely that it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the c terms, so the answer would be 384.\n\nBut to be thorough, let me check both interpretations.\n\nFirst interpretation: Coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of c. Then, it's 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nSecond interpretation: Coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but let me see if the problem is perhaps miswritten, and the user intended to ask for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). Because otherwise, the problem seems a bit strange to ask for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without any c terms, since the product includes c terms.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is only considering the terms where the exponents of c cancel out, so that the term is \\(a^2b^2\\). In that case, the coefficient would be 120.\n\nBut given that the problem didn't specify, I think the intended answer is 120, because it's more likely that the problem wants the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times c^0, i.e., the constant term in c.\n\nWait, but I'm confused because in the problem statement, it's written as \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), so the variables are separate, and the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would include all possible c terms. So, perhaps the correct approach is 384.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is in two variables, a and b, and c is another variable, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the sum over all c terms of the product of coefficients. So, 6 times the sum of coefficients in the second part, which is 64, giving 384.\n\nBut now I'm more confident that the answer is 384.\n\nWait, but let me think again. When you have a product of two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in one set of variables is the product of the coefficients of that term in each polynomial, but when variables are separate, it's a bit different.\n\nWait, no, actually, when you have separate variables, like (a + b) and (c + 1/c), then the product will have terms like a*c, a*(1/c), b*c, b*(1/c), etc. So, when you're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), you have to consider that \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by every possible term from the second polynomial. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part, because each term in the second part contributes to the coefficient when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\).\n\nTherefore, I think the correct answer is 384.\n\nWait, but let me just confirm with an example. Suppose I have (a + b)^1 * (c + 1/c)^1. The expansion is (a + b)(c + 1/c) = a*c + a*(1/c) + b*c + b*(1/c). Now, the coefficient of \\(a^1b^0\\) in this product would be the coefficient of \\(a^1b^0\\) in (a + b), which is 1, multiplied by the sum of coefficients in (c + 1/c), which is 2. So, the coefficient of \\(a^1b^0\\) is 2, which is 1 * 2. Similarly, the coefficient of \\(a^0b^1\\) is also 2. So, in this case, the coefficient of \\(a^1b^0\\) is indeed 2, which is the coefficient in the first part times the sum of coefficients in the second part.\n\nTherefore, applying that logic, in our problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but in this example, the coefficient of \\(a^1b^0c^1\\) is 1, and the coefficient of \\(a^1b^0c^{-1}\\) is 1, so the total coefficient of \\(a^1b^0\\) is 2, which is correct.\n\nSo, yes, that seems to confirm that the approach is correct.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is 384.\n\nWait, but just to be thorough, let me compute the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) as well, in case that's what the problem intended. So, as I calculated before, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is C(6, 3) = 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) would be 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nBut since the problem didn't specify \\(c^0\\), I think the correct answer is 384. However, I'm a bit unsure because sometimes problems like this expect you to consider only the terms where the c terms cancel out, so that the overall term is just \\(a^2b^2\\). But without explicit mention, it's hard to say.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is written in a way that the variables are separate, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the product of the coefficients from each part, but that doesn't make sense because the second part has variables c, so it's not a coefficient but a separate polynomial.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, treating c as a separate variable, which would mean that the coefficient is 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part, giving 384.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem is intended to have the term \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by c^0, then it's 120.\n\nWait, perhaps I should look at the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the c terms, so it's 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 64, giving 384.\n\nTherefore, I think the answer is 384.\n\nWait, but to make sure, let me think about the expansion. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\), and it's multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which is 64, giving 384.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nSo, in summary:\n\n1. Find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\): it's C(4, 2) = 6.\n\n2. Find the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\): substitute c = 1, get (1 + 1)^6 = 64.\n\n3.

    "text": " Hmm, that seems a bit tricky at first glance, but let me break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I know that when you expand expressions like \\((a + b)^n\\) or \\((c + 1/c)^m\\), you can use the binomial theorem. The binomial theorem states that \\((x + y)^k = \\sum_{i=0}^{k} \\binom{k}{i} x^{k-i} y^i\\). So, maybe I can apply that here.\n\nThe problem asks for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Let me think: since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are in the first part of the product, which is \\((a + b)^4\\), I can focus on expanding that part first and see how the \\(a^2b^2\\) term comes about.\n\nExpanding \\((a + b)^4\\), using the binomial theorem, would give me terms like \\(\\binom{4}{0}a^4b^0\\), \\(\\binom{4}{1}a^3b^1\\), \\(\\binom{4}{2}a^2b^2\\), and so on. The term I'm interested in is \\(\\binom{4}{2}a^2b^2\\). \n\nCalculating the binomial coefficient \\(\\binom{4}{2}\\), which is 6, so the term is \\(6a^2b^2\\). So, in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6.\n\nBut wait, the entire expression is multiplied by \\((c + 1/c)^6\\). So, does that affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)? Let me think. Since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are in the first part and \\(c\\) terms are in the second part, when we multiply the two expansions together, the terms from each will combine. \n\nSpecifically, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\((c + 1/c)^6\\). However, since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\) at all, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. But wait, that doesn't seem right because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. \n\nWait, no. Actually, I think I'm overcomplicating it. Let me clarify: the question is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but in the entire product, which includes both the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms and the \\(c\\) terms. So, when we multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\((c + 1/c)^6\\), each term in the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. Therefore, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by every term in the second expansion. \n\nBut wait, the question is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). That means we're looking for all the terms where the product results in \\(a^2b^2\\) times something involving \\(c\\). But since \\(a^2b^2\\) is already a term, and it's multiplied by terms from the second expansion, which are all in terms of \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would actually be the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, because each term in the first part is multiplied by the entire second expansion. \n\nWait, that doesn't make sense. Let me think again. If I have \\((a + b)^4 = A + B + C + ...\\), where A is the \\(a^4\\) term, B is the \\(a^3b\\) term, C is the \\(a^2b^2\\) term, and so on, and \\((c + 1/c)^6 = D + E + F + ...\\), where D is the \\(c^6\\) term, E is the \\(c^5(1/c)\\) term, etc., then when I multiply them together, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. \n\nSo, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion will be multiplied by every term in the second expansion, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^5(1/c)\\), and so on. Therefore, in the entire product, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually be the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, because each of these multiplied terms has \\(a^2b^2\\) as a factor, but with different powers of \\(c\\). \n\nWait, but the question is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, does that mean we're treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable and just want the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) irrespective of the \\(c\\) terms? Or are we supposed to consider all possible combinations where \\(a^2b^2\\) appears multiplied by some \\(c\\) terms? \n\nI think the question is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, meaning that we have to consider all the terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) appears, each multiplied by some combination of \\(c\\) terms. But since the problem is written as \\((a + b)^4 (c + 1/c)^6\\), and we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), it's possible that the coefficient is the same as in the first part, because each term in the first part is multiplied by the entire second expansion, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the entire second expansion. \n\nWait, but that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the question is asking for a numerical coefficient. So, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Maybe the question is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable, so the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\((c + 1/c)^6\\). But that seems unlikely because the question is phrased as \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", which usually refers to the coefficient when all variables are considered, but in this case, \\(a^2b^2\\) is separate from \\(c\\). \n\nWait, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, meaning that we can treat \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) separately from \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the entire second expansion. But that would make the coefficient a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't seem right because the question is likely expecting a numerical coefficient. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, considering all possible terms. But since \\(a^2b^2\\) is only present in the first part, and when multiplied by the second part, it just adds a factor, so the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all terms in the second expansion. But that doesn't make sense because the sum of all terms in the second expansion isn't a single coefficient. \n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Maybe the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, so the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\((c + 1/c)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, not a number. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is written incorrectly, and it should be \\((a + b + c + 1/c)^{10}\\) or something like that, but as it is, it's two separate products. \n\nWait, let me read the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 (c + 1/c)^6\\)\". So, the expression is the product of two separate binomial expansions. So, when we multiply them, each term from the first expansion is multiplied by each term from the second expansion. \n\nTherefore, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion will be multiplied by every term from the second expansion, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^5(1/c)\\), etc. So, in the entire product, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, because each of these multiplied terms has \\(a^2b^2\\) as a factor, but with different powers of \\(c\\). \n\nWait, but the question is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term in the product. However, in the product, \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by various powers of \\(c\\), so the term \\(a^2b^2\\) itself doesn't exist in the product unless we consider it as \\(a^2b^2\\) times 1, but since the second part doesn't have a constant term unless \\(c^0\\) is present. \n\nWait, let's check if \\((c + 1/c)^6\\) has a constant term. Let's expand it: \\((c + 1/c)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\binom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} (1/c)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\binom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, the exponent of \\(c\\) is \\(6 - 2k\\). For the exponent to be zero, we need \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\). So, the constant term is \\(\\binom{6}{3} = 20\\). \n\nTherefore, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion will be multiplied by 20 from the second expansion to give the term \\(20a^2b^2\\). Additionally, it will be multiplied by other terms like \\(c^6\\), \\(c^5(1/c)\\), etc., but those will result in terms like \\(6a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(6a^2b^2c^5(1/c)\\), etc., which are different from \\(a^2b^2\\). \n\nSo, the only term in the product that has exactly \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms is when the second factor contributes the constant term, which is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nWait, let me confirm that. So, from the first expansion, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. From the second expansion, the constant term is 20. Therefore, when we multiply these two, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) gets multiplied by 20, giving a total coefficient of 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The constant term in \\((c + 1/c)^6\\) is 20. Multiplying these together gives 6 * 20 = 120.\n\n\\boxed{120}"

    "text": " Wait, but hold on, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but in the expression, there are also terms with \\(c\\) and \\(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\). Hmm, that seems a bit confusing. Let me try to make sense of it.\n\nFirst, maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but considering that \\(c\\) terms don't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. So perhaps I can treat the two parts separately. Let me check.\n\nWait, actually, the expression is a product of two separate expansions: one involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the other involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). Since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\), and \\(1/c\\) are different variables, their coefficients don't directly interfere with each other. So maybe the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because the terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) don't interact with \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). Wait, is that correct?\n\nWait, no. Let me think again. When you multiply two expressions together, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression. So if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term without any \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), that would require that in the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term is \\(c^0\\), because \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\) is still \\(a^2b^2\\). So actually, I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part, and then multiply them together to get the final coefficient in the product.\n\nWait, that makes more sense. So the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, which would be the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So I can compute each part separately and then multiply them.\n\nLet me start with the first part: \\((a + b)^4\\). I need the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). I remember that the expansion of \\((a + b)^n\\) is given by the binomial theorem, where the coefficient of \\(a^{k}b^{n - k}\\) is \\(\\dbinom{n}{k}\\). So in this case, \\(n = 4\\), and \\(k = 2\\) because we're looking for \\(a^2b^2\\). So the coefficient should be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\).\n\nCalculating that, \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\nNow, moving on to the second part: \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I need the coefficient of \\(c^0\\), which is the same as the constant term. Let me think about how to find that.\n\nAgain, using the binomial theorem, the expansion of \\((c + 1/c)^6\\) will have terms of the form \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}c^{k} \\times (1/c)^{6 - k}\\), which simplifies to \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}c^{2k - 6}\\). Wait, because \\(c^{k} \\times (1/c)^{6 - k} = c^{k - (6 - k)} = c^{2k - 6}\\). So each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}c^{2k - 6}\\).\n\nWe want the exponent of \\(c\\) to be 0, so we set \\(2k - 6 = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\) so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the term where \\(k = 3\\) is the constant term. The coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\).\n\nCalculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). Wait, that can't be right because 6! is 720, but 3! is 6, so 720 divided by (6 \u00d7 6) is indeed 20. So the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 20.\n\nNow, putting it all together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the two coefficients we found. So that would be 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the second part), which is 6 \u00d7 20 = 120.\n\nWait, that seems straightforward, but let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Let me double-check each step.\n\nFirst, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). That part is correct.\n\nNext, in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}c^{2k - 6}\\). To find the constant term, set \\(2k - 6 = 0\\), so \\(k = 3\\). The coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). That seems correct too.\n\nMultiplying them together, 6 \u00d7 20 = 120. So the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120.\n\nWait, but just to be thorough, maybe I should consider if there's any interaction between the \\(c\\) terms and the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms when expanding the product. But since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\), and \\(1/c\\) are all different variables, their exponents don't affect each other. So when I expand the product, the only way to get a term with \\(a^2b^2\\) is to take the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part and the \\(c^0\\) term from the second part. All other terms from the second part would introduce \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), which would make the term have those variables, not just \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). Therefore, the only contribution to \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from 6 \u00d7 20, which is 120.\n\nI think that's correct. So the coefficient is 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can treat the two parts separately and then multiply the results.\n\n1. **Finding the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\):**\n\n   Using the binomial theorem, the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is given by:\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{k} b^{4 - k}\n   \\]\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is found when \\(k = 2\\):\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\n   \\]\n\n2. **Finding the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n\n   Using the binomial theorem, the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is given by:\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^{6 - k} = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{2k - 6}\n   \\]\n   We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so we set \\(2k - 6 = 0\\), giving \\(k = 3\\).

Let me clarify. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) would come from the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), and the \\(c\\) parts from the second part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), would multiply this term.

Hmm, that might make sense.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Let me break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's expand \\((a + b)^4\\). Using the binomial theorem, the expansion is:\n\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\binom{4}{k} a^{k} b^{4 - k}\n\\]\n\nSo, the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) occurs is when \\(k = 2\\), because \\(a^2b^{4 - 2} = a^2b^2\\). The coefficient for this term is \\(\\binom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n\nNow, the other part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let's expand this using the binomial theorem as well:\n\n\\[\n\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\binom{6}{m} c^{m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^{6 - m} = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\binom{6}{m} c^{m - (6 - m)} = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\binom{6}{m} c^{2m - 6}\n\\]\n\nSo, each term in this expansion is \\(\\binom{6}{m} c^{2m - 6}\\), where \\(m\\) ranges from 0 to 6.\n\nNow, when we multiply the two expansions together, each term from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term from the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term from the second expansion, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2 \\times c^{2m - 6}\\) for each \\(m\\). The coefficient for each of these terms will be \\(6 \\times \\binom{6}{m}\\).\n\nBut the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). However, in the product, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term is multiplied by each term from the second expansion, which has different powers of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would actually be the sum of all the coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by 6, because each term from the second expansion is being multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\) with coefficient 6. Wait, but that doesn't seem right because each term from the second expansion has a different power of \\(c\\), so in reality, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients in the second expansion. Because each term in the second expansion contributes a coefficient that, when multiplied by 6, gives the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2 c^{2m - 6}\\). But if we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion.\n\nWait, but actually, the problem is phrased as \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)\", which suggests that we are looking for the coefficient of the term \\(a^2b^2\\) irrespective of the \\(c\\) terms.

When you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. So, if I have a term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first polynomial, and I multiply it by each term from the second polynomial, which is a sum of terms involving \\(c\\), then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be \\(6 \\times \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\binom{6}{m}\\), because each term from the second expansion contributes a coefficient to the product term \\(a^2b^2 c^{2m - 6}\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, does that mean we're summing over all possible \\(c\\) terms? Or is there a misunderstanding here?\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me consider that when you have two polynomials multiplied together, the coefficient of a specific term in one polynomial is multiplied by all the terms from the other polynomial. So, in this case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial is 6, and the second polynomial is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial in \\(c\\). So, when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second polynomial, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients in the second polynomial. Because each term from the second polynomial contributes a coefficient that, when multiplied by 6, gives the coefficient for the corresponding term \\(a^2b^2 c^{2m - 6}\\). But if we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) part, then the coefficient would indeed be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial.\n\nSo, to find the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial, we can substitute \\(c = 1\\) because that will make each term in the polynomial equal to its coefficient. Let's compute that:\n\n\\[\n\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = (1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial is 64. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\nWait, but let me check that again because I might be making a mistake. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but in the product, each term involving \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by a term from the second polynomial, which includes various powers of \\(c\\). So, if we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, then yes, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 6 \u00d7 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm misinterpreting the problem, and it's actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, meaning that the \\(c\\) terms are also part of the term. But in that case, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would have to be multiplied by a specific term from the second polynomial, but that doesn't make sense because the problem is only asking for \\(a^2b^2\\), not \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some \\(k\\). So, I think the correct interpretation is that we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, so the coefficient would be 6 \u00d7 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Let me consider the entire expansion. The product is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). When you expand this, each term is of the form \\(\\binom{4}{k}a^k b^{4 - k} \\times \\binom{6}{m}c^{m} (1/c)^{6 - m}\\), which simplifies to \\(\\binom{4}{k}\\binom{6}{m} a^k b^{4 - k} c^{2m - 6}\\).\n\nSo, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) occurs when \\(k = 2\\), so \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term from the second expansion, which has different powers of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the sum over all \\(m\\) of \\(\\binom{4}{2}\\binom{6}{m}\\). That is, 6 times the sum of \\(\\binom{6}{m}\\) for \\(m = 0\\) to \\(6\\). As we calculated earlier, the sum of \\(\\binom{6}{m}\\) from \\(m = 0\\) to \\(6\\) is \\(2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\nWait, but that seems correct, but let me make sure I'm not missing anything. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without considering the \\(c\\) terms, so in effect, treating the two parts as separate and multiplying their coefficients. But no, that's not accurate because the entire expression is a product, so the coefficients do interact in that way.\n\nWait, another approach: maybe the problem is intended to consider only the terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by a term that has \\(c^0\\), i.e., no \\(c\\) term, so that the overall term is \\(a^2b^2\\). In that case, we would need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion. That would be a different approach.\n\nSo, let me explore that possibility. If the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by \\(c^0\\), then we need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion, then multiply them together.\n\nIn that case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion is \\(\\binom{4}{2} = 6\\), as before.\n\nNow, in the second expansion, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), we need the coefficient of \\(c^0\\). From the earlier expansion, each term is \\(\\binom{6}{m} c^{2m - 6}\\). So, the exponent of \\(c\\) is \\(2m - 6\\). We set this equal to 0 to find the term with \\(c^0\\):\n\n\\[\n2m - 6 = 0 \\implies 2m = 6 \\implies m = 3\n\\]\n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\binom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n\nTherefore, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then the coefficient would be \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nBut the problem as stated is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression. Now, I'm confused because depending on the interpretation, the answer could be 384 or 120.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is intended to ask for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), but it's not clear. Let me check the problem statement again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, it's only asking for \\(a^2b^2\\), without specifying any \\(c\\) terms. So, in the product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) can be multiplied by any power of \\(c\\), but the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion. So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 \u00d7 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it's 6 \u00d7 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but in the product, each term is a combination of \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) parts. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) can exist with various powers of \\(c\\), but the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), irrespective of the \\(c\\) part. So, in that case, the coefficient would be the sum over all possible \\(c\\) terms multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), which is 6 \u00d7 sum of coefficients in the second expansion. Since the sum of coefficients in the second expansion is 64, the coefficient would be 384.\n\nWait, but that seems a bit counterintuitive because when you multiply two polynomials, each term from the first is multiplied by each term from the second, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would indeed be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial, because each coefficient in the second polynomial contributes to a term that includes \\(a^2b^2\\).\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting the answer to be 120, considering only the \\(c^0\\) term. But I'm not sure. Let me think again.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is intended to have the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, but without considering the \\(c\\) terms, meaning that we're treating the two polynomials as separate and looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and the coefficient of 1 (i.e., the constant term) in the second part. So, in that case, the answer would be 6 \u00d7 20 = 120.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to have the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, meaning that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 6 \u00d7 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me think about it in terms of generating functions. If I have two generating functions multiplied together, the coefficient of a term in one variable is the product of the coefficients from each generating function for the respective terms. But in this case, since the second generating function is in \\(c\\), and we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), perhaps the coefficient is the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first generating function and the sum of all coefficients in the second generating function, because the second generating function can contribute any term, but we're only interested in the part that doesn't involve \\(c\\). Wait, but that doesn't make sense because the second generating function is in \\(c\\), so when you multiply, each term from the second generating function is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), giving a term that includes \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second generating function, because each term from the second generating function contributes a coefficient that, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), gives a term with \\(a^2b^2\\) and some power of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the sum of all these contributions, which is 6 \u00d7 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to have the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, but only considering the terms where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. In that case, the coefficient would be 6 \u00d7 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but the problem statement is ambiguous. Let me check the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" It doesn't specify any \\(c\\) terms, so perhaps the answer is 384, as that would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when considering all possible \\(c\\) terms. However, I might be overcomplicating it.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to have the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, but only considering the terms where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, which would be 120. To resolve this, perhaps I should consider the problem from the perspective of combining like terms. In the product, each term is a product of a term from the first polynomial and a term from the second polynomial. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) can be combined with any term from the second polynomial, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^{2m - 6}\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the sum of all coefficients from the second polynomial multiplied by the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial. That would be 6 \u00d7 64 = 384.\n\nBut let me think again: when you have two polynomials multiplied together, the coefficient of a specific term in one polynomial is multiplied by each term in the other polynomial. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial. Because each term in the second polynomial contributes a coefficient that, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), gives a term with \\(a^2b^2\\) and some power of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is indeed 6 \u00d7 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me do a small test. Let's take a simpler example. Suppose we have \\((a + b)^1 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). The expansion is \\((a + b)(c + 1/c)\\). The coefficient of \\(a\\) in this product would be 1 \u00d7 (1 + 1) = 2, because the terms would be \\(a c\\), \\(a \\times 1/c\\), \\(b c\\), and \\(b \\times 1/c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a\\) is indeed the coefficient of \\(a\\) in the first polynomial (which is 1) multiplied by the sum of coefficients in the second polynomial (which is 2). Similarly, the coefficient of \\(b\\) would be 1 \u00d7 2 = 2.\n\nExtending this to our problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial (which is 6) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial (which is 64). So, 6 \u00d7 64 = 384.\n\nTherefore, I think the correct answer is 384.\n\nWait, but let me check this with another approach. Let's compute the product \\((a + b)^4 \\times (c + 1/c)^6\\) as two separate expansions and then look for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\).\n\nFirst, as before, \\((a + b)^4\\) has the term \\(a^2b^2\\) with coefficient 6.\n\nNow, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) can be written as \\(c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15/c^2 + 6/c^4 + 1/c^6\\). The sum of all coefficients is obtained by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\(1 + 6 + 15 + 20 + 15 + 6 + 1 = 64\\), as before.\n\nSo, when we multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) with coefficient 6 in the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, resulting in terms like \\(6 \\times 1 \\times a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(6 \\times 6 \\times a^2b^2c^4\\), and so on. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is indeed the sum of all these coefficients, which is 6 \u00d7 (1 + 6 + 15 + 20 + 15 + 6 + 1) = 6 \u00d7 64 = 384.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 384.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought that maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be 6 \u00d7 20 = 120. But given that the problem doesn't specify any \\(c\\) terms, I think the correct interpretation is that the coefficient is 384.\n\nWait, but let me check once more. If I consider the product as a polynomial in \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\), then the term \\(a^2b^2\\) can be multiplied by any power of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the sum of all coefficients from the second polynomial multiplied by 6, because each term from the second polynomial contributes a coefficient to a term that includes \\(a^2b^2\\). So, 6 \u00d7 64 = 384.\n\nYes, that makes sense. Therefore, the coefficient is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplying it by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The sum of coefficients in the second expression is found by substituting \\(c = 1\\), yielding \\(2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{384}."

    "text": " Hmm, okay, let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I think I need to consider the expansion of both parts of the expression separately. That is, I'll expand \\((a + b)^4\\) and then expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), and then multiply them together. But wait, the question is only asking about the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So maybe I don't need to worry about the entire expansion, just the parts that contribute to \\(a^2b^2\\).\n\nLet me start with the first part: \\((a + b)^4\\). I remember that the binomial expansion formula is \\((x + y)^n = \\sum_{k=0}^{n} \\binom{n}{k} x^{n - k} y^{k}\\). So, applying this to \\((a + b)^4\\), the expansion will be \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\binom{4}{k} a^{4 - k} b^{k}\\). \n\nSince we're looking for the term \\(a^2b^2\\), I need to find the value of \\(k\\) where \\(a^{4 - k} b^{k}\\) becomes \\(a^2b^2\\). So, setting \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). That makes sense because \\(4 - 2 = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). So the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is \\(\\binom{4}{2}\\).\n\nCalculating \\(\\binom{4}{2}\\): that's 4! / (2! * (4 - 2)!) = (24) / (2 * 2) = 24 / 4 = 6. So, the coefficient is 6.\n\nWait, but that's just the first part. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, do I need to consider the second part as well?\n\nHmm, actually, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product. But \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), right? So, when we multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the terms in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from the terms in \\(c\\). So, does that mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just the same as in \\((a + b)^4\\), regardless of the other terms?\n\nWait, but that doesn't seem right. Let me think again. Because when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficients of the terms combine. So, if I have \\( (a + b)^4 \\) multiplied by \\( \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 \\), each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial.\n\nBut since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), we need to consider how many times \\(a^2b^2\\) appears in the product. Wait, but \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term from \\((a + b)^4\\), and the other part is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, when you multiply them, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part will be multiplied by every term in the second part.\n\nBut since the question is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), does that mean that the coefficient is actually the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\)?\n\nWait, no, that can't be right. Because when you multiply two polynomials, each term is multiplied by each term, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial. But wait, no, that's not exactly correct because the second polynomial is in terms of \\(c\\), which doesn't interact with \\(a\\) and \\(b\\).\n\nWait, actually, in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by every term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which includes terms like \\(c^6\\), \\(c^4\\), \\(c^2\\), \\(c^0\\), \\(c^{-2}\\), \\(c^{-4}\\), \\(c^{-6}\\), each with their own coefficients.\n\nBut since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), that would mean that we need to find all the terms in the product where the power of \\(c\\) is zero because only then would the term not involve \\(c\\). Wait, but \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and when multiplied by terms from the second polynomial, it would result in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) where \\(k\\) is some exponent. So, the only way to get a term that is just \\(a^2b^2\\) is if the second part contributes a term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, i.e., \\(c^0 = 1\\).\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\).\n\nSo, first, we found that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\nNext, we need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Let's work on that.\n\nAgain, using the binomial expansion: \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\binom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(1/c\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\binom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m} = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\binom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\).\n\nWe need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be zero, so we set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\).\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\binom{6}{3}\\).\n\nCalculating \\(\\binom{6}{3}\\): that's 6! / (3! * 3!) = (720) / (6 * 6) = 720 / 36 = 20.\n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20.\n\nNow, putting it all together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the product of the two coefficients we found: 6 (from \\(a^2b^2\\)) and 20 (from \\(c^0\\)).\n\nSo, 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but let me double-check that. Is there a possibility that I missed something? For example, when expanding the product, could there be other terms that contribute to \\(a^2b^2\\) besides the \\(c^0\\) term?\n\nWait, no, because any term from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) that has a non-zero exponent of \\(c\\) would result in a term like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) where \\(k\\) is non-zero, which is not just \\(a^2b^2\\). So, only the term where \\(c^0\\) contributes to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\).\n\nTherefore, the coefficient is indeed 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but let me make sure that I didn't make a mistake in calculating the binomial coefficients. For \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\binom{4}{2} = 6\\), which is correct. For \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term where the exponent is zero is when \\(m = 3\\), so the coefficient is \\(\\binom{6}{3} = 20\\), which is also correct.\n\nSo, multiplying 6 and 20 gives 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 120.\n\nI think that's it. I don't see any mistakes in the reasoning. So, the final answer should be 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Multiplying these gives the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product as 6 * 20 = 120.\n\n$\\boxed{120}$"

The other part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), seems to involve variables c and 1/c, but since we're only concerned with the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), maybe the c terms don't matter here?

So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because each term in the c expansion will multiply the a^2b^2 term. Wait, is that correct?\n\nWait, no, that's not quite right. Because when you multiply two polynomials, each term from the first polynomial is multiplied by each term from the second polynomial. So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), that term is only present in the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), and it's multiplied by every term in the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because each term in the c expansion is a coefficient times some power of c, but when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), it becomes \\(a^2b^2\\) times that coefficient times c^something. But since we're only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the c terms, we need to consider all possible c terms that can be multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, no, that's not quite right either.\n\nWait, actually, when you multiply two polynomials, each term from the first is multiplied by each term from the second. So, if I have \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part, and then from the second part, say, a term like \\(c^k\\), then the resulting term would be \\(a^2b^2c^k\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would require that the exponents of c are zero, right? Because \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term with only a and b, no c. So, actually, I think I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because only the constant term in the c expansion will result in a term with \\(a^2b^2\\) when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). So, that makes sense.\n\nSo, first, I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\). Then, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Then, multiply those two coefficients together to get the final coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression.\n\nLet me start with the first part: the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\). I know that the binomial expansion of \\((a + b)^n\\) is given by \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{n} \\binom{n}{k} a^{n - k}b^k\\). So, for \\(n = 4\\), the expansion is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\binom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\\). We want the term where \\(a^2b^2\\), so that would be when \\(4 - k = 2\\), which implies \\(k = 2\\). So, the coefficient is \\(\\binom{4}{2}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\binom{4}{2} = \\frac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\nNow, moving on to the second part: finding the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Hmm, okay. So, this is similar to finding the constant term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The general term in the expansion is given by the binomial theorem as \\(\\binom{6}{m} c^{m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^{6 - m}\\), which simplifies to \\(\\binom{6}{m} c^{m - (6 - m)} = \\binom{6}{m} c^{2m - 6}\\). We need the exponent of c to be zero, so we set \\(2m - 6 = 0\\), which gives \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(\\binom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\binom{6}{3} = \\frac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20.\n\nNow, to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we multiply the two coefficients we found: 6 and 20. So, 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but let me double-check to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed \\(\\binom{4}{2} = 6\\). That seems correct.\n\nFor the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the general term is \\(\\binom{6}{m} c^{m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^{6 - m} = \\binom{6}{m} c^{2m - 6}\\). Setting the exponent equal to zero gives \\(2m - 6 = 0\\), so \\(m = 3\\). The coefficient is \\(\\binom{6}{3} = 20\\), which is correct.\n\nMultiplying them together, 6 * 20 = 120, so the coefficient should be 120. Hmm, that seems right. I don't think I made any mistakes here.\n\nAlternatively, I can think about the entire expansion. When you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion will be multiplied by every term in the second expansion. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would require that the c terms cancel out (i.e., the exponent of c is zero), we only consider the term in the second expansion that is \\(c^0\\), which we found to have a coefficient of 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nYes, I think that's correct.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is found using the binomial coefficient \\(\\binom{4}{2} = 6\\). The constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by setting the exponent of \\(c\\) to zero, which gives the coefficient \\(\\binom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying these coefficients together yields \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\boxed{120}"

    "text": " Hmm, okay. Let me try to figure this out step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that when you have an expression like \\((a + b)^n\\), you can expand it using the binomial theorem. The binomial theorem says that \\((a + b)^n = \\sum_{k=0}^{n} \\binom{n}{k} a^{n - k} b^k\\). So, for our problem, \\(n = 4\\), so the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) will have terms from \\(a^4\\) down to \\(b^4\\), each multiplied by a binomial coefficient.\n\nSimilarly, the other part of the expression is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Again, this can be expanded using the binomial theorem. So, that would be \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\binom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying that, each term becomes \\(\\binom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m} = \\binom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\).\n\nWait, but in our original problem, we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, I need to find the term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) that has \\(a^2b^2\\), and then multiply it by the corresponding term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But hold on, actually, since the two expansions are multiplied together, the terms from each expansion multiply each other. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\). Or wait, maybe I'm confusing something here.\n\nLet me clarify. The expression is \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when we expand both, each term in the first expansion will multiply each term in the second expansion. So, the terms will look like \\(\\binom{4}{k} a^{4 - k} b^k \\times \\binom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\).\n\nBut we are interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, in the first expansion, the term with \\(a^2b^2\\) occurs when \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\), because \\(a^{4 - k}b^k = a^2b^2\\) implies \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). So, the coefficient for this term is \\(\\binom{4}{2}\\).\n\nNow, since this term is multiplied by every term in the second expansion, which is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion because \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\). So, we need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. That is, \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(6 = 2m\\), so \\(m = 3\\).\n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion is \\(\\binom{6}{3}\\).\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of \\(\\binom{4}{2}\\) and \\(\\binom{6}{3}\\).\n\nLet me compute these binomial coefficients. \\(\\binom{4}{2}\\) is 6 because 4 choose 2 is 6. \\(\\binom{6}{3}\\) is 20 because 6 choose 3 is 20.\n\nMultiplying them together, 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. The term in the first expansion is \\(\\binom{4}{2} a^2b^2\\), which is 6a\u00b2b\u00b2. The term in the second expansion that contributes is \\(\\binom{6}{3} c^0 = 20\\). So, when we multiply 6a\u00b2b\u00b2 by 20, we get 120a\u00b2b\u00b2. So, the coefficient is indeed 120.\n\nBut hold on, is that correct? Because when we multiply the two expansions, every term in the first expansion is multiplied by every term in the second. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the sum over all possible m of \\(\\binom{4}{2} \\times \\binom{6}{m}\\) where the exponents of c in the second expansion don't affect the a\u00b2b\u00b2 term. Wait, no, because the a\u00b2b\u00b2 term is independent of c, so when we multiply, the coefficient of a\u00b2b\u00b2 would be \\(\\binom{4}{2}\\) multiplied by the sum of all terms in the second expansion that don't involve c. But actually, the second expansion is multiplied as a whole, so the coefficient is just \\(\\binom{4}{2} \\times \\binom{6}{3}\\), because only the term where m=3 gives c^0, which doesn't affect the a\u00b2b\u00b2 term.\n\nWait, maybe another way to think about it is that the entire expression is a product of two independent expansions. So, the coefficient of a\u00b2b\u00b2 is the coefficient in the first expansion times the coefficient of c^0 in the second expansion, which is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider that the product of the two expansions is the product of each term, so the a\u00b2b\u00b2 term in the first part will be multiplied by every term in the second part, but since we are only interested in the coefficient of a\u00b2b\u00b2, which doesn't involve c, we need to consider only the term in the second expansion that doesn't involve c, which is the c^0 term. So, yes, that term is 20, so 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should think of the entire expansion as a product, so the coefficient of a\u00b2b\u00b2c^0 would be 6 * 20 = 120, but since the problem only asks for the coefficient of a\u00b2b\u00b2, which is independent of c, it's just 120.\n\nWait, but is there a possibility that other terms in the second expansion could contribute to a\u00b2b\u00b2? For example, if the second expansion had a c^k term that could somehow cancel out to c^0 when multiplied by something else, but no, because in the first expansion, there's no c terms. So, the only way a\u00b2b\u00b2 can appear is when multiplied by c^0 from the second expansion.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient is indeed 120.\n\nWait, but let me check my calculations again. \\(\\binom{4}{2}\\) is 6, correct. \\(\\binom{6}{3}\\) is 20, correct. 6 * 20 is 120, correct.\n\nSo, I think that's the answer.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is \\(\\binom{4}{2} = 6\\). The coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\binom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying these gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\boxed{120}."

    "text": " Hmm, let's see. I think I can break this down into parts because the expression is a product of two binomials raised to different powers. Maybe I can handle each part separately and then combine them.\n\nFirst, let me consider the \\((a + b)^4\\) part. I remember that when expanding a binomial like \\((a + b)^n\\), the coefficients can be found using the binomial theorem. The binomial theorem says that \\((a + b)^n = \\sum_{k=0}^{n} \\binom{n}{k} a^{n - k} b^k\\). So, in this case, \\(n = 4\\), and I need the term where \\(a^2 b^2\\). \n\nLet me write out the expansion for \\((a + b)^4\\). The general term is \\(\\binom{4}{k} a^{4 - k} b^k\\). I need the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2. So, \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). That means the coefficient is \\(\\binom{4}{2}\\). \n\nCalculating that, \\(\\binom{4}{2} = \\frac{4!}{2!2!} = \\frac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2 b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\nWait, but the original problem is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the other part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I think this part doesn't affect the coefficient of \\(a^2 b^2\\) because it's multiplied by other terms involving \\(c\\). So, maybe the coefficient of \\(a^2 b^2\\) is just the same as in the first part, which is 6. But I'm not entirely sure. Let me think again.\n\nWait, no, that can't be right because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2 b^2\\) in the entire product. So, perhaps I need to consider the expansion of both parts together. Let me clarify.\n\nWhen you multiply two expressions, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression. So, the term \\(a^2 b^2\\) comes only from the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), and it's multiplied by every term in the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2 b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), I think it's the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all the coefficients from the second part. But wait, that doesn't make sense because the second part has terms with \\(c\\), so when you multiply \\(a^2 b^2\\) by each term in the second part, you get terms like \\(a^2 b^2 c^k\\) or \\(a^2 b^2 c^{-k}\\), but the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2 b^2\\), which would require that the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out, i.e., \\(k = 0\\). \n\nWait, no, that might not be correct. Let me think again. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2 b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, in the product, each term from \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2 b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by each term from the second part, resulting in terms like \\(a^2 b^2 c^k\\) and \\(a^2 b^2 c^{-k}\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2 b^2\\), which would only include terms where the exponents of \\(c\\) are zero, right? Because \\(a^2 b^2\\) is a term without \\(c\\), so only when \\(k = 0\\) in the second part would the term contribute to \\(a^2 b^2\\). \n\nWait, but that might not be the case. Let me clarify. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2 b^2\\) in the entire expansion. So, if I consider the product, any term that has \\(a^2 b^2\\) multiplied by any power of \\(c\\) would contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2 b^2\\) only if the power of \\(c\\) is zero. Because otherwise, the term would have \\(a^2 b^2 c^k\\) or \\(a^2 b^2 c^{-k}\\), which are different from \\(a^2 b^2\\). So, I think I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2 b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and then multiply it by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because that's the only term that won't introduce any \\(c\\) factors. \n\nSo, first, from \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2 b^2\\) is 6, as I found earlier. Now, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\), I can use the binomial theorem again. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\binom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k\\). Simplifying that, each term is \\(\\binom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} c^{-k} = \\binom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\).\n\nWe need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be zero, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(\\binom{6}{3}\\).\n\nCalculating that, \\(\\binom{6}{3} = \\frac{6!}{3!3!} = \\frac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\frac{720}{36} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20.\n\nNow, the total coefficient of \\(a^2 b^2\\) in the entire product is the product of the two coefficients: 6 (from the first part) and 20 (from the second part). So, 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not missing something. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2 b^2\\), and I've considered that it's the product of the coefficients from each part where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2 and 2, and the exponents of \\(c\\) are 0. So, I think that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should think about it differently. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When you expand this, each term is of the form \\(\\binom{4}{k} a^{4 - k} b^{k} \\times \\binom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). So, the general term is \\(\\binom{4}{k} \\binom{6}{m} a^{4 - k} b^{k} c^{6 - 2m}\\).\n\nWe want the term where \\(a^2 b^2\\), so \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). So, \\(k = 2\\), and the coefficient from the first part is \\(\\binom{4}{2} = 6\\). Now, for the second part, we want the exponent of \\(c\\) to be zero, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which gives \\(m = 3\\). The coefficient from the second part is \\(\\binom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, the total coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2 b^2\\) is 120.\n\nWait, but let me check if there's another way to approach this. Maybe by considering the entire product and seeing if there's a different way to compute it, but I think the method I used is correct. So, I think the answer is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is found by considering the contributions from each part of the product. \n\n1. **From \\((a + b)^4\\):** The term \\(a^2b^2\\) has a coefficient of \\(\\binom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n2. **From \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):** The term with \\(c^0\\) (which doesn't affect the \\(a^2b^2\\) term) has a coefficient of \\(\\binom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n\nMultiplying these coefficients gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\boxed{120}"

The binomial theorem says that \\((a + b)^n = \\sum_{k=0}^{n} \\binom{n}{k} a^{n-k}b^{k}\\). So, maybe I can apply that here for the \\((a + b)^4\\) part.\n\nLet me write that out. For \\((a + b)^4\\), the expansion would be:\n\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\binom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^{k}\n\\]\n\nSo, the terms in this expansion would be:\n\n- When \\(k = 0\\): \\(\\binom{4}{0}a^4b^0 = 1 \\cdot a^4\\)\n- When \\(k = 1\\): \\(\\binom{4}{1}a^3b^1 = 4a^3b\\)\n- When \\(k = 2\\): \\(\\binom{4}{2}a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\\)\n- When \\(k = 3\\): \\(\\binom{4}{3}a^1b^3 = 4ab^3\\)\n- When \\(k = 4\\): \\(\\binom{4}{4}a^0b^4 = 1 \\cdot b^4\\)\n\nSo, looking at this, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. That seems straightforward.\n\nNow, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Hmm, so I think I need to consider how the terms from \\((a + b)^4\\) interact with the terms from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nWait, but the term \\(a^2b^2\\) only involves \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), so maybe the part with \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) doesn't affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)? Or does it?\n\nLet me think. When you multiply two expressions together, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by every term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), we don't care about the terms involving \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\). So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product will just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nWait, is that correct? Because when you multiply, each term in the first expression is multiplied by each term in the second, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nBut let me verify that. Alternatively, maybe I should consider that the terms involving \\(c\\) don't interfere with the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms, so the coefficient remains 6 regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. Hmm, that seems more likely because \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are independent variables. So, when you multiply two expressions, the coefficients for the terms involving different variables just multiply together.\n\nWait, but actually, no. Let me think again. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be \\(a^2b^2 \\times c^k\\) for some \\(k\\), but the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by every term in the other expression.\n\nWait, no, that's not quite right. Because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would include all possible terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient would actually be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) has a coefficient, and when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each of those terms, you get \\(a^2b^2 \\times\\) (coefficient from \\(c\\) terms) times \\(c^k\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, we need to sum all the coefficients from the \\(c\\) terms and then multiply by 6.\n\nWait, but that doesn't sound right either because the \\(c\\) terms are separate. Let me try to approach it differently.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is just 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because when you expand the product, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), so the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, each contributing a coefficient, and since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, it would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion.\n\nWait, but the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of all coefficients is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nBut wait, that seems high. Let me check if that's correct. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it.\n\nWait, perhaps I should think of it as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is the middle term, which would be the term where the powers of \\(c\\) cancel out. So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is the central term, which is \\(\\binom{6}{3}\\), since we choose 3 \\(c\\)s and 3 \\(1/c\\)s, giving \\(c^3 \\times (1/c)^3 = c^0\\). So, \\(\\binom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but which approach is correct? Let me clarify.\n\nThe problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). When you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion will be multiplied by every term in the second expansion, each contributing a coefficient. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be \\(6\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nBut the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is indeed found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\(2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient would be \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\nBut then, in the other approach, considering only the \\(c^0\\) term, we get 120. So, which is it?\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the second approach. Let me think again. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, when we multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term contributes a coefficient, and all those coefficients add up. So, the total coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) across all possible \\(c\\) terms is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nBut wait, that would mean that in the product, \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by every term in the second expansion, so the coefficient would be 6 * sum of coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem had asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some specific \\(k\\), then we would need to find the coefficient of \\(c^k\\) in the second expansion and multiply by 6. But since it's just asking for \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\), the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion.\n\nWait, but that seems a bit counterintuitive. Let me think about a simpler example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^1 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, expanding, it's \\((a + b)(c + 1/c)\\). The coefficient of \\(a\\) would be 1 times (c + 1/c), so the coefficient of \\(a\\) in the product would be (c + 1/c). But if I set \\(c = 1\\), then the sum of coefficients in the second expansion is 2, so the coefficient of \\(a\\) would be 1 * 2 = 2. But in reality, when you expand, the coefficient of \\(a\\) is \\(c + 1/c\\), which is a variable, not a constant. Hmm, so maybe my initial approach was wrong.\n\nWait, no, in that example, if I set \\(c = 1\\), then the coefficient of \\(a\\) would be 2, which is correct because each term is multiplied by 1, so \\(a\\) would have coefficient 1*1 + 1*1 = 2. But in reality, the expansion is \\(ac + a/c + bc + b/c\\), so the coefficient of \\(a\\) is \\(c + 1/c\\), which is not a constant. So, perhaps my initial approach is incorrect because the coefficients depend on \\(c\\), and we can't just sum them all.\n\nWait, but in the original problem, we are looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in the expansion, each term would be of the form \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), where \\(k\\) can be any integer, positive or negative. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would include all terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any power of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, because each term in the second expansion contributes a coefficient when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\).\n\nWait, but in my simple example, when I set \\(c = 1\\), the sum of coefficients is 2, so the coefficient of \\(a\\) would be 1 * 2 = 2, which is correct because when \\(c = 1\\), the expansion becomes \\(a + b + ac + a/c + bc + b/c\\), but that's not right. Wait, no, when \\(c = 1\\), the expansion is \\((a + b)(1 + 1) = 2(a + b)\\), so the coefficient of \\(a\\) is 2, which matches the approach. So, in that case, the coefficient of \\(a\\) is indeed 2, which is 1 (from \\((a + b)^1\\)) times 2 (sum of coefficients in the second expansion). So, that seems correct.\n\nTherefore, applying that to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought of considering only the \\(c^0\\) term, which gave me 120. So, which is correct?\n\nWait, perhaps the confusion arises from whether we're considering the coefficient as a polynomial in \\(c\\) or just the numerical coefficient regardless of \\(c\\). Let me clarify the problem statement: it says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\". Since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term in the product, but in the product, each term will have both \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) parts and \\(c\\) parts. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, each contributing a coefficient. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nBut wait, let me think again. If I have two polynomials, P(a, b) and Q(c), then the coefficient of a term in P(a, b) * Q(c) is the product of the coefficients. So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), it would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in P(a, b) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in Q(c). Because each term in Q(c) contributes a coefficient when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\).\n\nYes, that makes sense. So, in this case, the sum of all coefficients in Q(c) is when we set c = 1, which gives \\( (1 + 1)^6 = 64 \\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but I'm still a bit confused because in the simple example, when I set c = 1, I get the sum of coefficients, and that works. So, applying that here, it should be correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should think of it as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient, regardless of \\(c\\), it's 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion.\n\nTherefore, the final answer should be 384.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought of the \\(c^0\\) term, which is 20, and 6 * 20 = 120. So, which is correct? Let me check with an example.\n\nLet me take a simpler case: \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^2\\). Let's compute the coefficient of \\(a^2b^0\\) in this product.\n\nFirst, \\((a + b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^0\\) is 1.\n\nNow, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^2 = c^2 + 2 + 1/c^2\\). The sum of coefficients is 1 + 2 + 1 = 4.\n\nSo, according to the first approach, the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) would be 1 * 4 = 4.\n\nBut let's compute the product:\n\n\\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^2 = (a^2 + 2ab + b^2)(c^2 + 2 + 1/c^2)\\).\n\nExpanding, the term \\(a^2\\) would be multiplied by each term in the second expansion:\n\n\\(a^2c^2 + 2a^2 + a^2/c^2\\).\n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) (regardless of \\(c\\)) is indeed 2, not 4. Wait, that's a problem. So, according to the first approach, I thought it would be 1 * 4 = 4, but in reality, it's 2.\n\nWait, so that means my initial approach was wrong. So, what's going on here?\n\nWait, in this example, the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) in the product is 2, which is the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) in \\((a + b)^2\\) (which is 1) multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^2\\) (which is 2). So, 1 * 2 = 2.\n\nSo, that suggests that the correct approach is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and multiply it by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). That would give the correct coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\).\n\nWait, but in the earlier example, when I thought of the sum of coefficients, I got 4, but the actual coefficient of \\(a^2\\) was 2. So, that approach was wrong. Therefore, the correct approach is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion and multiply it by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion.\n\nSo, in the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\binom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, that makes sense with the simpler example. So, in the simpler example, the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) was 1, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion was 2, so 1 * 2 = 2, which matched the actual expansion.\n\nTherefore, the correct approach is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and multiply it by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 20, giving 120.\n\nSo, that must be the correct answer.\n\nWait, but let me make sure. Let me compute the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) and check the coefficient of \\(c^0\\).\n\nUsing the binomial theorem, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\binom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\cdot (1/c)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\binom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\).\n\nWe need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so 6 - 2k = 0 \u2192 2k = 6 \u2192 k = 3. So, the coefficient is \\(\\binom{6}{3} = 20\\), as I thought.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nSo, the final answer is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Multiplying these gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\boxed{120}."

    "text": " Hmm, that seems a bit involved, but I think I can break it down.\n\nFirst, I remember that when dealing with expressions raised to powers, the binomial theorem is really useful. The binomial theorem says that \\((x + y)^n = \\sum_{k=0}^{n} \\binom{n}{k} x^{n - k} y^k\\). So, I can apply this theorem to both parts of the given expression: \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nLet me start with the first part: \\((a + b)^4\\). Using the binomial theorem, this expands to \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\binom{4}{k} a^{4 - k} b^k\\). So, the terms in this expansion will be of the form \\(\\binom{4}{k} a^{4 - k} b^k\\).\n\nI'm specifically looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, I need to find the term where \\(a\\) is squared and \\(b\\) is squared. That would correspond to the term where \\(4 - k = 2\\) for \\(a\\) and \\(k = 2\\) for \\(b\\). Solving \\(4 - k = 2\\) gives \\(k = 2\\). So, the coefficient here is \\(\\binom{4}{2}\\).\n\nCalculating \\(\\binom{4}{2}\\), which is the number of combinations of 4 things taken 2 at a time. I remember that \\(\\binom{n}{k} = \\dfrac{n!}{k!(n - k)!}\\). Plugging in the numbers, \\(\\binom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\nNow, moving on to the second part: \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Again, using the binomial theorem, this expands to \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\binom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying each term, \\(\\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = c^{-m}\\), so each term becomes \\(\\binom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m} = \\binom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\).\n\nNow, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) because the problem is asking for \\(a^2b^2\\), and since the entire expression is multiplied together, the powers of \\(c\\) should cancel out if they are zero. Wait, actually, no, because the original problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating this.\n\nWait, no. Let me think again. The problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product. So, when we multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the sum of all products where the term from \\((a + b)^4\\) is \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by any term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, actually, no, because the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and the other terms involve \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), which don't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't make sense because the coefficient should be a number, not a polynomial in \\(c\\). Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem.\n\nWait, no, the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, actually, when we multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by every term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be \\(6 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that's a polynomial in \\(c\\), not a constant. Wait, that can't be right because the problem is asking for a coefficient, which is a number. So, perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nWait, maybe I misread the problem. Let me check again. The problem says: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, perhaps the problem is considering the entire expression as a product, and we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). That is, when you expand the entire product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by various powers of \\(c\\), but the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the sum of all the coefficients from the \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) expansion, because each term in that expansion is a coefficient times \\(c^{6 - 2m}\\), and when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), it becomes that coefficient times \\(a^2b^2c^{6 - 2m}\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), that would mean we need to sum all the coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would just be the sum of the coefficients, which is found by setting \\(c = 1\\). So, the sum of the coefficients is \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). Wait, but that seems too high.\n\nWait, no, maybe not. Let me think again. Actually, when you have two separate variables, \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) and \\(c\\), the terms are independent. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since we're only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\), that would mean that the coefficient is 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is indeed 64. So, 6 * 64 = 384. But I'm not sure if that's correct because the problem might be considering the entire product and looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which would be the case if we were treating \\(c\\) as another variable, but perhaps the problem is only considering \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) and wants the coefficient without any \\(c\\) terms. Wait, but that would require that the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, so we'd have to find the term where \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which gives \\(m = 3\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\binom{6}{3}\\).\n\nLet me clarify: If the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then we need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), and then multiply them together. That makes sense because when you multiply the two expansions, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part and \\(c^0\\) from the second part would combine to give \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), and the coefficient would be the product of the two coefficients.\n\nSo, let's calculate that. As before, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is \\(\\binom{4}{2} = 6\\). Now, for \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term where \\(c^0\\) occurs is when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. As I derived earlier, each term is \\(\\binom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, setting \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), we get \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(\\binom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n\nNow, multiplying these two coefficients together: \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product is 120.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought about the sum of coefficients, which was 64, but that would be if we were considering the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), which would be the case if the problem was asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product without considering \\(c\\). But that doesn't make much sense because \\(c\\) is a separate variable. So, perhaps the correct interpretation is that we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where \\(a\\) is squared, \\(b\\) is squared, and \\(c\\) is to the zero power. That would make the answer 120.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms, then it's 120. If it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, then it would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. But that seems unlikely because the problem probably wants the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\).\n\nWait, let me check the problem statement again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" It doesn't specify anything about \\(c\\), so perhaps it's considering the entire product and looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). That would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nBut that seems too large, and I think the more standard interpretation would be to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be 120. So, perhaps I should go with that.\n\nWait, let me think again. The problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", without specifying anything about \\(c\\). So, in the product, each term is of the form \\(a^kb^{4 - k}c^{6 - 2m}c^{-m}\\), but wait, no, actually, the expansion is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), so each term is \\(\\binom{4}{k}a^{k}b^{4 - k} \\times \\binom{6}{m}c^{6 - m}c^{-m}\\), which simplifies to \\(\\binom{4}{k}\\binom{6}{m}a^{k}b^{4 - k}c^{6 - 2m}\\).\n\nSo, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would occur when \\(k = 2\\), so \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\), and the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) is \\(\\binom{4}{2} = 6\\). Now, for each \\(m\\), the term from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\binom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, when we multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each of these terms, we get \\(6 \\times \\binom{6}{m} a^2b^2c^{6 - 2m}\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\) would be the sum over all \\(m\\) of \\(6 \\times \\binom{6}{m}\\), which is \\(6 \\times 2^6 = 6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\nBut that seems like a lot. Alternatively, if we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then we need \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), so \\(m = 3\\), and the coefficient is \\(6 \\times \\binom{6}{3} = 6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nI think the confusion arises from whether the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\) or specifically when \\(c\\) is to the zero power. Since the problem doesn't specify anything about \\(c\\), it's ambiguous. However, in standard problems like this, when you're asked for the coefficient of a term with certain variables, it's usually considering the entire product, but if other variables are present, you might need to specify their exponents. Since the problem didn't specify anything about \\(c\\), perhaps it's expecting the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms, which would be 120.\n\nAlternatively, if it's just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), then it's 384, but that seems less likely. I think the intended answer is 120, so I'll go with that.\n\nWait, let me confirm. If I expand \\((a + b)^4\\), I get terms up to \\(a^4b^0\\), and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) expands to terms involving various powers of \\(c\\). So, when I multiply these together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), etc. But if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then the coefficient would indeed be the sum of all the coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by 6. That would be 6 * (1 + 1)^6 = 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nBut that seems counterintuitive because the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would then be a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense. So, perhaps the correct interpretation is that we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is only considering \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) is a separate variable, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the sum of all the coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by the coefficient from the first part. That is, 6 * sum of coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 2^6 = 384.\n\nBut I'm still unsure. Let me try to think of it another way. If I have two polynomials, P(a, b) and Q(c), then the product P(a, b) * Q(c) would have terms where each term in P is multiplied by each term in Q. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in P(a, b) multiplied by the entire Q(c). So, in other words, the coefficient would be 6 * Q(c). But that's a polynomial, not a number. Therefore, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be a specific term.\n\nGiven that, I think the intended answer is 120, as that corresponds to the term where \\(c\\) cancels out, leaving only \\(a^2b^2\\). So, I'll go with 120 as the coefficient.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is found by considering the expansion of each part separately and then combining the relevant coefficients. \n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\)** using the binomial theorem:\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\binom{4}{k} a^{4 - k} b^k\n   \\]\n   The term with \\(a^2b^2\\) occurs when \\(k = 2\\), giving the coefficient:\n   \\[\n   \\binom{4}{2} = 6\n   \\]\n\n2. **Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)** using the binomial theorem:\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\binom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\binom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n   \\]\n   The term where \\(c^0\\) occurs is when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), so \\(m = 3\\), giving the coefficient:\n   \\[\n   \\binom{6}{3} = 20\n   \\]\n\n3. **Combine the coefficients**:\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is the product of the two coefficients:\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 20 = 120\n   \\]\n\n**Final Answer:** The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}."

    "text": " Wait, but hold on, the problem is about the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but the expression also involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). Hmm, does that mean the problem is actually about a combined expansion? Let me make sure I understand correctly.\n\nSo, the expression is \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The question is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). But since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\), and \\(1/c\\) are all different variables, I think the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would only come from the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\), right? Because the other part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), so when we multiply, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term would just be multiplied by whatever comes from the \\(c\\) terms. But wait, no, actually, the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so perhaps we can treat the two parts separately.\n\nLet me break this down. First, I can consider the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\). I know that the binomial theorem tells us that \\((a + b)^n = \\sum_{k=0}^{n} \\binom{n}{k} a^{n - k}b^{k}\\). So, for \\(n = 4\\), the expansion will have terms from \\(a^4\\) down to \\(b^4\\). The term with \\(a^2b^2\\) would be when \\(k = 2\\), because \\(n - k = 2\\) implies \\(k = 2\\). So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is \\(\\binom{4}{2}\\), which is 6. So, that's straightforward.\n\nBut then, the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when we multiply these two expansions together, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). However, the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first part will be multiplied by all the terms in the second part. But since the second part doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product will just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire second part. Wait, no, that's not quite right.\n\nWait, actually, when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms from each polynomial. But in this case, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) only comes from the first polynomial, and in the second polynomial, there are no \\(a\\) or \\(b\\) terms, so when we multiply, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will be multiplied by every term in the second polynomial. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so that would mean that the coefficient is the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients from the second part, right?\n\nWait, no, that's not correct either. Because when you multiply two polynomials, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part would be multiplied by each term in the second part, so the resulting terms would be \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) and \\(a^2b^2c^{6 - k}\\), but the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would require that the second part contributes a term that is 1, i.e., the constant term. Because if the second part contributes a term with \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), then the overall term would have \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), and thus not just \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is equal to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nSo, that makes sense. Therefore, I need to compute two things: the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which we already found to be 6, and the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Then, multiply those two together to get the final coefficient.\n\nNow, let's compute the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Again, using the binomial theorem, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\binom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\binom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\).\n\nWe need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, because that's the constant term. So, set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(6 = 2k\\) so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\binom{6}{3}\\), which is 20.\n\nSo, the constant term is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nWait, but let me double-check that reasoning. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\) with coefficient 6, and when we multiply by the constant term of the second polynomial, which is 20, so 6 * 20 = 120. That seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, another way to think about it is that in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) can only come from the product of the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first polynomial and the constant term in the second polynomial, because any other term from the second polynomial would introduce a \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), which would make the overall term have \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or similar, which isn't just \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient is indeed 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nSo, I think that's the correct answer. Let me just recap:\n\n1. Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\binom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n\n2. Expand \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem. The constant term occurs when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, which happens when \\(k = 3\\). The coefficient is \\(\\binom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n\n3. Multiply the two coefficients together: \\(6 * 20 = 120\\).\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is 120.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break the problem into two parts:\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\):**\n   Using the binomial theorem, the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is:\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\binom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^{k}\n   \\]\n   The term with \\(a^2b^2\\) occurs when \\(k = 2\\):\n   \\[\n   \\binom{4}{2} a^{2}b^{2} = 6a^{2}b^{2}\n   \\]\n   So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6.\n\n2. **Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   Using the binomial theorem, the expansion is:\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\binom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\binom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n   \\]\n   The constant term (where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0) occurs when \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\):\n   \\[\n   \\binom{6}{3} c^{0} = 20\n   \\]\n   So, the constant term is 20.\n\n3. **Combine the results:**\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficients from each part:\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 20 = 120\n   \\]\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

So perhaps the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just the same as in \\((a + b)^4\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms? But that seems odd because the entire expression is a product, so maybe I have to consider all possible terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) appears when multiplied by some terms from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), so when you multiply them, the terms are independent. So maybe the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, that can't be right because the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) would be when \\(c = 1\\), which is \\(2^6 = 64\\), so the total coefficient would be 64 times the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\). But is that correct?\n\nWait, no, maybe not. Because when you multiply two expressions, each term from the first expression is multiplied by each term from the second. So the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is indeed 64. But that seems a bit strange because the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not considering any \\(c\\) terms. So maybe the problem is intended to have the \\(c\\) part not affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms, so perhaps I'm overcomplicating it.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is written incorrectly, and it's supposed to be just \\((a + b)^4\\), but let's assume it's correct as written. So, I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and then multiply it by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, that doesn't make sense because when you multiply, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would only come from the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by every term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, first, let's find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\).\n\nUsing the binomial theorem, \\((a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^4 \\binom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\\). So, the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) occurs is when \\(4 - k = 2\\), so \\(k = 2\\). Thus, the coefficient is \\(\\binom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n\nNow, for the \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) part, the sum of all coefficients is when we set \\(c = 1\\). So, substituting \\(c = 1\\), we get \\((1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\).\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\nWait, but let me check if that makes sense. Because when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in one part is multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the other part, yes. Because each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by every term in the second, so when you're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), you have to consider that it's multiplied by every possible term from the second polynomial, which includes all the \\(c\\) terms. But since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient would indeed be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 64, giving 384.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it, and the problem is intended to have us ignore the \\(c\\) part because it's not part of the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. So, perhaps the answer is just 6, but that seems unlikely because the problem includes the \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) part. So, I think the correct approach is to consider that the coefficient is 6 times 64, which is 384.\n\nWait, but let me think again. When you have \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is multiplied by every term in the second part, which includes \\(c^6\\), \\(c^4\\), etc., down to \\(c^{-6}\\). But since we're only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial, which is indeed 64. So, 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but another way to think about it is that the entire expression is a product, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), meaning that each term in the expansion would have a coefficient, and the total coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times each of those. But that's not correct because when you multiply, each term from the first polynomial is multiplied by each term from the second, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 64. So, 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me check that again. Suppose I have two polynomials, P(a, b) and Q(c). Then, the product P(a, b) * Q(c) would have terms where each term in P is multiplied by each term in Q. So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, it would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in P(a, b) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in Q(c). Because \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve c, so every term in Q(c) will multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term, contributing their coefficients. So, the total coefficient would be 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to have us consider that the \\(c\\) terms are separate, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just 6, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. But that seems unlikely because the problem includes the \\(c\\) terms in the product. So, I think the correct approach is to consider that the coefficient is 384.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in calculating the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). The sum of coefficients is found by setting c = 1, so \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\), which is correct. So, 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but another way to think about it is that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the same as the coefficient in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which would mean that the coefficient is 6 times each term in the expansion, but that's not correct because when you multiply, each term is multiplied by each term. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to have the \\(c\\) terms not affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms, so the coefficient is just 6. But that seems incorrect because the problem includes the \\(c\\) terms in the product. So, I think the correct answer is 384.\n\nWait, but let me check if that makes sense. Let's consider a simpler case. Suppose we have \\((a + b)^2 (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^0\\) would be \\(\\binom{2}{2} = 1\\) times the sum of coefficients in \\((c + 1/c)^1\\), which is \\(1 + 1 = 2\\), so the coefficient would be 1 * 2 = 2. But in reality, the product would be \\((a^2 + 2ab + b^2)(c + 1/c)\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^0c^0\\) would be 1 * 1 (from c^0 term, which is not present, so actually, it's zero). Wait, that's different. So, perhaps my earlier approach is wrong.\n\nWait, so in that case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^0c^0\\) would be zero because there's no c^0 term in \\((c + 1/c)^1\\). So, the sum of coefficients isn't the right approach because only specific terms contribute. So, in that case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^0\\) in the product would be zero because there's no c^0 term. So, my earlier approach is incorrect.\n\nWait, so perhaps I need to think differently. The problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the c terms. So, in the product, any term that has \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by any term from the c expansion. But since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the same as in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), because each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) would multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term, contributing their coefficients. But in the example I just did, that approach didn't work because the sum of coefficients is 2, but the actual coefficient of \\(a^2b^0c^0\\) is zero. So, maybe that approach is wrong.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct way is that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which would be a polynomial in c, but the problem is asking for a coefficient, which implies a numerical coefficient, not a term with c. So, perhaps the problem is intended to have us find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the c terms, meaning that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 64, giving 384.\n\nWait, but in my earlier example, that approach didn't work because the coefficient of \\(a^2b^0c^0\\) was zero, but the sum of coefficients is 2, so 1 * 2 = 2, but the actual coefficient was zero. So, that approach is incorrect.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is intended to have us consider that the c terms are separate, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just 6, regardless of the c terms. But that seems too simple, and the problem includes the c terms, so maybe I'm missing something.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where the exponents of c cancel out. So, in that case, we need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product. So, that would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, in that case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\).\n\nSo, let's compute the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^6 \\binom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\cdot c^{-k} = \\sum_{k=0}^6 \\binom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\).\n\nWe want the exponent of c to be zero, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\). So, the coefficient is \\(\\binom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nWait, that makes more sense because in my earlier example, if I set the exponent of c to zero, then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^0c^0\\) would be 1 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\((c + 1/c)^1\\), which is zero because there's no c^0 term. So, in that case, the coefficient would be zero, which matches the actual product.\n\nSo, going back to the original problem, if the question is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the c terms, then the answer would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the c part, which is 64, giving 384. But if the question is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it's 6 times 20, which is 120.\n\nBut the problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", without mentioning c, so maybe it's intended to be 384. However, given that the expression includes c terms, perhaps the intended answer is 120, considering only the terms where the exponents of c cancel out. So, I'm a bit confused.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the c terms, so it's 6 times 64, which is 384. Alternatively, if it's to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), it's 120. So, perhaps the problem is ambiguous, but given that it's written as \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), and asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), it's more likely that they want the coefficient considering all possible c terms, so 384.\n\nWait, but in the earlier example, that approach didn't work because it gave an incorrect result. So, perhaps the correct approach is to consider that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the same as the coefficient in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients in the c part, which is 64, giving 384.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to have the c terms not affect the a and b terms, so the coefficient is just 6. But that seems unlikely because the c terms are part of the product.\n\nWait, perhaps I should think of it as a generating function. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is a coefficient times a power of c, and when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), it becomes a term like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\). But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of c, that would mean summing over all possible k, so the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but in that case, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would have a coefficient that's a polynomial in c, which doesn't make sense because a coefficient should be a number, not a polynomial. So, perhaps the problem is intended to have us find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is written incorrectly, and it's supposed to be \\((a + b + c)^4\\), but that's just a guess. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating c as a separate variable, so the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which would be a polynomial, but the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, so that can't be right.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of the c terms, meaning that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the c part, which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to have us consider that the c terms are separate, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just 6, regardless of the c terms. But that seems too simple, and the problem includes the c terms, so I think the correct approach is to consider that the coefficient is 384.\n\nWait, but in the earlier example, when I set the exponent of c to zero, the coefficient was zero, which was correct. So, perhaps the problem is intended to have us find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is written as \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), and it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would include all possible c terms, so the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the c part, which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nGiven that the problem is written as is, I think the intended answer is 120, considering only the terms where the exponents of c cancel out, so that the overall term is \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient would be 6 times 20, which is 120.\n\nWait, but I'm not sure. Let me check again.\n\nIf I consider that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the c terms, then the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the c part, which is 64, giving 384.\n\nBut if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it's 6 times 20, which is 120.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the c part, so 384.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, which would require considering only the terms where the exponents of c are zero, so 120.\n\nGiven that the problem is written as is, I think the correct approach is to consider that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the same as in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients in the c part, so 384.\n\nWait, but in the earlier example, that approach didn't work because it gave an incorrect result.

So, perhaps the problem is intended to have us find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nWait, I'm getting confused because the problem is ambiguous. Let me try to think differently.\n\nThe problem is: What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nSince \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are different variables, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by every possible term from the c part, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, as calculated earlier.\n\nThe sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\).\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\nBut wait, in the example I did earlier, this approach didn't work because it gave an incorrect result. So, perhaps the problem is intended to have us find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be 120.\n\nWait, but the problem didn't specify anything about c, so perhaps it's intended to have us consider all possible c terms, making the coefficient 384.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to have us find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of c, which would be 6 times 64, so 384.\n\nWait, but in the product, each term from \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the same as in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients in the c part, which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nTherefore, I think the correct answer is 384.\n\nWait, but let me check again with the example.\n\nIf I have \\((a + b)^2 (c + 1/c)^1\\), then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^0\\) would be 1 times the sum of coefficients in \\((c + 1/c)^1\\), which is 2, so 1 * 2 = 2. But when I expand the product, I get \\((a^2 + 2ab + b^2)(c + 1/c)\\), which has terms like \\(a^2c\\), \\(2abc\\), \\(b^2c\\), \\(a^2/c\\), \\(2ab/c\\), \\(b^2/c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^0c^0\\) is zero, not 2. So, my approach is incorrect.\n\nWait, so that means that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is not simply 6 times the sum of coefficients in the c part. So, perhaps the correct approach is to consider that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 20, so 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is 120.\n\nWait, that makes sense because in the example, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^0c^0\\) was zero, which matches the actual expansion.

    "text": " Hmm, okay, let's try to figure this out step by step.\n\nFirst, I know that when you have an expression like \\((a + b)^n\\), you can expand it using the binomial theorem. The binomial theorem says that \\((a + b)^n = \\sum_{k=0}^{n} \\binom{n}{k} a^{n - k} b^{k}\\). So, maybe I can apply that here for the \\((a + b)^4\\) part.\n\nLet me write that out for \\(n = 4\\). So, \\((a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\binom{4}{k} a^{4 - k} b^{k}\\). The terms will be:\n\n- When \\(k = 0\\): \\(\\binom{4}{0}a^4b^0 = 1 \\cdot a^4 \\cdot 1 = a^4\\)\n- When \\(k = 1\\): \\(\\binom{4}{1}a^3b^1 = 4a^3b\\)\n- When \\(k = 2\\): \\(\\binom{4}{2}a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\\)\n- When \\(k = 3\\): \\(\\binom{4}{3}a^1b^3 = 4ab^3\\)\n- When \\(k = 4\\): \\(\\binom{4}{4}a^0b^4 = 1 \\cdot 1 \\cdot b^4 = b^4\\)\n\nSo, the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) includes a term \\(6a^2b^2\\). That means the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in this part is 6.\n\nBut wait, the original problem is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression might depend on the other part as well, right? Because when you multiply two expressions together, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second.\n\nSo, I think I need to consider the entire expression. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all terms in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, that doesn't make sense because the other part is in terms of c, so unless we are looking for a term that includes both \\(a^2b^2\\) and some specific power of c, maybe the coefficient is just the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that seems too broad.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me read the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" Hmm, so it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but the expression also has c terms. So, perhaps the term \\(a^2b^2\\) can be multiplied by any term from the second expansion, but we are only concerned with the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the c terms. Or maybe we need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times some specific power of c. Wait, the problem doesn't specify anything about c, so maybe it's just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the c terms. But that can't be, because the entire expression is a product of two polynomials, so each term will have both a and c parts.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, treating c as another variable. So, when we expand the entire expression, we'll have terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2c^{-k}\\), and the coefficient would be the sum of all coefficients where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by some power of c.\n\nBut that seems a bit complicated. Alternatively, maybe the question is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), treating the c terms as separate, so the coefficient would just be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would make the coefficient a polynomial in c, which doesn't make much sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the question. Let me think again. The problem says: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, perhaps it's considering the entire expression as a polynomial in a, b, c, and we need to find the coefficient of the term where a is squared, b is squared, and c is raised to some power, but the problem doesn't specify a particular power for c. So, maybe the answer is that the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that seems unlikely because the problem is expecting a numerical coefficient.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the c terms, meaning that we just take the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) and multiply it by the entire expansion of the c terms. But that would make the coefficient a polynomial in c, which is not a single number. So, maybe I'm missing something.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, without considering the c terms. But that doesn't make sense because the product includes both a, b, and c terms. So, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by some specific term in c. But the problem doesn't specify, so perhaps it's just the coefficient from the a and b part, and the c part is treated separately. But that seems unclear.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is expecting the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating c as a separate variable, so the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would be 6 times (the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\)), which is 6 times (the number of terms or something else). Wait, no, the sum of coefficients in a polynomial is found by setting all variables to 1. So, setting c=1, \\(\\left(1 + 1/1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of coefficients in the c part is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 * 64 = 384. But I'm not sure if that's what the problem is asking.\n\nWait, maybe that's the right approach. Let me think: when you have a product of two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each polynomial. So, if we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), we can consider that in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient is 6, as we saw earlier. Then, in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), every term is multiplied by this 6, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the c part. But the sum of coefficients in the c part is found by substituting c=1, which gives 64. So, 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nBut wait, is that correct? Let me check. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the sum over all terms of (coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial) times (coefficient of \\(c^k\\) in the second polynomial). Since the first polynomial's coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, and the second polynomial's coefficients sum up to 64 when c=1, then yes, the total coefficient would be 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the c terms, meaning that it's just 6, but that seems too simple, and the presence of the c terms suggests that the answer might involve more.\n\nWait, maybe I should approach it differently. Let me consider that the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, when you expand this, each term will be of the form (coefficient from (a+b)^4) * (coefficient from (c + 1/c)^6) * a^{something} b^{something} c^{something}.\n\nBut the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, regardless of the c terms, the coefficient would be the sum of all coefficients from the (c + 1/c)^6 expansion multiplied by 6, because the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in (a + b)^4 is 6. So, that sum is 64, as we saw earlier, so 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting just the coefficient from (a + b)^4, which is 6, and the c terms are irrelevant. But that seems unlikely because the problem includes both parts.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is only considering the a and b terms and ignoring the c terms, but that seems odd. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), meaning the term where c is raised to the zero power. That would make sense because then we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by the constant term in the c expansion.\n\nSo, let me try that approach. First, find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6. Then, find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Then, multiply those two coefficients together to get the final coefficient.\n\nSo, let's compute the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\binom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\times (1/c)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\binom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\).\n\nWe need the term where the exponent of c is 0, so 6 - 2k = 0. Solving for k: 6 = 2k => k = 3. So, the coefficient is \\(\\binom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Now, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6, so the total coefficient would be 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, that makes sense. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by the constant term from the c expansion, which is 20, giving a total coefficient of 120.\n\nBut earlier, I thought the answer might be 384, but that was when considering the sum of all coefficients in the c expansion, which is 64, leading to 6*64=384. But now, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), then it's 120.\n\nI think I need to clarify the problem statement. The problem says: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" It doesn't specify anything about c, so perhaps it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the c terms, meaning that it's just 6, but that seems too simple.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be 120. Or maybe it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times any c term, which would be 6 times the entire c expansion, but that would be a polynomial, not a single number.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is expecting the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, treating c as a variable, so the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would be a polynomial, not a single coefficient. So, perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of c, which would just be 6.\n\nBut that seems odd because the problem includes both parts. Maybe I should check both interpretations.\n\nFirst interpretation: The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the c terms. So, the coefficient is 6.\n\nSecond interpretation: The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nThird interpretation: The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, which would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the c expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nBut which one is correct? Let's see.\n\nLooking back at the problem: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\"\n\nSince it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and the expression is a product of two polynomials, the coefficient would be the sum of all coefficients where the a and b parts are \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the c parts. So, that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial in c. But the problem is asking for a coefficient, which is a number, not a polynomial. Therefore, perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, ignoring the c terms, which is 6.\n\nBut that seems too simple, and the problem includes both parts, so maybe it's expecting to consider the c terms as well, but only for the specific term where c is raised to a certain power. Since the problem doesn't specify, perhaps it's expecting to treat c as another variable and find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of c, which would be 6 times the entire c expansion, but that's a polynomial, not a number.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the a and b parts, regardless of c, so the answer is 6.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider that when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each polynomial. So, for \\(a^2b^2\\), the coefficient in the first polynomial is 6, and in the second polynomial, since it's \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20, as we saw earlier. Therefore, the total coefficient for \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nBut the problem didn't specify the c part, so maybe it's only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of c, which would mean that it's 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the c expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, without any restriction on c, then it's 6 times the entire c expansion. But that would mean that the coefficient is a polynomial, which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient.\n\nTherefore, perhaps the intended interpretation is that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where a is squared, b is squared, and c is to the zero power. In that case, the coefficient would be 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating c as a separate variable, so the coefficient would be 6 times the entire c expansion, which would be a polynomial, but that seems unlikely because the problem is asking for a coefficient, which is a number.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think again. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. So, in the product, each term is of the form (coefficient from a and b) * (coefficient from c terms) * a^something * b^something * c^something. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the sum of all coefficients from the c expansion multiplied by 6, because 6 is the coefficient from the a and b part for \\(a^2b^2\\).\n\nBut that would mean the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the c expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem is only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of c, then it's 6. But that seems too simple.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is expecting the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, which would be 6 times the entire c expansion, but that's a polynomial, not a number. Therefore, perhaps the problem is expecting the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nI think the most reasonable interpretation is that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), so the answer is 120.\n\nWait, but to be thorough, let me check both possibilities.\n\nFirst, if we take the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of c, then the coefficient is 6 times the entire c expansion, which is 6*(c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15/c^2 + 6/c^4 + 1/c^6). So, that's a polynomial in c, which isn't a single number, so that can't be the answer.\n\nSecond, if we take the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nTherefore, I think the intended answer is 120.\n\nSo, to summarize:\n\n1. Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is 6.\n\n2. Expand \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\), which is \\(\\binom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n\n3. Multiply these two coefficients together: 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is found by considering the coefficient from each part of the product. \n\n1. From \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6.\n2. From \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) (the constant term) is 20.\n3. Multiplying these gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\boxed{120}"

    "text": " Hmm, okay. Let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I know that when you have an expression like \\((a + b)^n\\), you can expand it using the binomial theorem. The binomial theorem states that \\((a + b)^n = \\sum_{k=0}^{n} \\binom{n}{k} a^{n - k}b^{k}\\). So, for \\((a + b)^4\\), I can write it as \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\binom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^{k}\\).\n\nSimilarly, the other part of the expression is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I can also expand this using the binomial theorem, which would give me \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\binom{6}{m} c^{6 - m}\\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^{m}\\). Simplifying that, since \\(\\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = c^{-m}\\), the expression becomes \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\binom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\).\n\nNow, the original problem is the product of these two expansions: \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when I multiply these two expansions together, I'll be multiplying each term from the first expansion by each term from the second expansion. That sounds like a lot of terms, but I don't actually need to compute all of them. I just need the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a specific term in the expansion.\n\nWait, but hold on. When I multiply the two expansions, each term in the first expansion is of the form \\(\\binom{4}{k}a^{4 - k}b^{k}\\) and each term in the second expansion is of the form \\(\\binom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, when I multiply a term from the first expansion by a term from the second expansion, I get a term like \\(\\binom{4}{k}\\binom{6}{m}a^{4 - k}b^{k}c^{6 - 2m}\\).\n\nBut the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). That means I need to find all the terms in the product where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2. So, I need to find the values of \\(k\\) such that \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). Let me check that: if \\(4 - k = 2\\), then \\(k = 2\\). So, in the first expansion, the term where \\(k = 2\\) gives me \\(a^2b^2\\), and that's the only term in the first expansion that contributes to \\(a^2b^2\\).\n\nNow, that term is \\(\\binom{4}{2}a^2b^2\\). The coefficient here is \\(\\binom{4}{2}\\), which is 6. But wait, when I multiply this by the second expansion, which has terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product will actually be the sum of the products of this coefficient (6) and the coefficients from the second expansion, but only for the terms where the exponents of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) don't affect \\(a\\) and \\(b\\).\n\nWait, but actually, in the product, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, which are powers of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product will be the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion times the sum of all terms in the second expansion. But that can't be right because the second expansion has different powers of \\(c\\), which don't affect the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). Wait, no, actually, when you multiply, each term from the first expansion is multiplied by each term from the second expansion, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion multiplied by the entire second expansion, but that's not correct because the exponents of \\(c\\) don't influence the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. Wait, that doesn't make sense because the second expansion is a separate variable. Hmm, maybe I'm confusing something.\n\nWait, no. Let me think again. When you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum of the products of coefficients of terms in each polynomial whose exponents add up to the desired term. But in this case, since the variables are different (a, b vs c, 1/c), the exponents don't interfere. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. Because when you multiply by each term in the second expansion, you're effectively scaling the \\(a^2b^2\\) term by each coefficient in the second expansion.\n\nBut wait, the second expansion is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the sum of all coefficients in this expansion is obtained by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be \\(\\binom{4}{2} \\times 64 = 6 \\times 64 = 384\\). But wait, that seems too straightforward. Let me check if that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Since the variables are separate, the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are independent of those of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the entire second part. But that would mean the coefficient is \\(\\binom{4}{2} \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial, not a single coefficient. That can't be right because the problem asks for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which should be a numerical coefficient, not a polynomial.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, in the entire product, when expanded, what is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\), and \\(1/c\\) are all separate variables, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by every term from the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion.\n\nBut wait, the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion is indeed 64, as I calculated before by setting \\(c = 1\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\nBut let me think again. Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that each term in the product is of the form \\(\\binom{4}{k}a^{4 - k}b^{k} \\times \\binom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, for \\(a^2b^2\\), we need \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). So, the coefficient from the first part is \\(\\binom{4}{2} = 6\\). Then, the term from the second part is \\(\\binom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\), but since we're just looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), the coefficient will be the sum over all \\(m\\) of \\(\\binom{6}{m}\\), because each term in the second expansion contributes its coefficient to the product with \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the total coefficient is \\(6 \\times \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\binom{6}{m}\\).\n\nBut \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\binom{6}{m} = 2^6 = 64\\), so the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\nWait, that seems consistent with my earlier thought. So, the coefficient is 384.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should think of it as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product being the product of the coefficients of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and the sum of coefficients in the second part, since the variables are independent.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So, the coefficient is indeed 384.\n\nWait, but let me check with another approach to be sure. Let's compute the product step by step.\n\nFirst, expand \\((a + b)^4\\). The expansion is:\n\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\binom{4}{0}a^4b^0 + \\binom{4}{1}a^3b^1 + \\binom{4}{2}a^2b^2 + \\binom{4}{3}a^1b^3 + \\binom{4}{4}a^0b^4\n\\]\nWhich simplifies to:\n\\[\na^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\n\\]\n\nNow, expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The expansion is:\n\n\\[\n\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\binom{6}{m}c^{6 - m}\\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\binom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\n\\]\n\nSo, the product of the two expansions is:\n\n\\[\n(a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4) \\times \\left(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\binom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\right)\n\\]\n\nNow, when we multiply these together, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. So, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, resulting in \\(6a^2b^2 \\times \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\binom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\).\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 multiplied by the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion. As before, the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion is 64, so 6 \u00d7 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not missing anything. Is there a possibility that other terms in the first expansion could contribute to \\(a^2b^2\\) when multiplied by terms from the second expansion? For example, could a term like \\(a^3b\\) multiplied by a term involving \\(c\\) somehow result in \\(a^2b^2\\)? But no, because the variables are different. Multiplying by terms in the second expansion only affects the powers of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), not \\(a\\) or \\(b\\). So, the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) remain as they are in the first expansion. Therefore, only the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion contributes to \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, and its coefficient gets multiplied by the entire second expansion.\n\nHence, the coefficient is indeed 384.\n\nAlternatively, to confirm, let's compute the entire product up to the \\(a^2b^2\\) term, but that's unnecessary because the other terms don't affect \\(a^2b^2\\).\n\nWait, but let me think again. Suppose I have \\(a^4 \\times\\) something. That would give terms like \\(a^4c^6\\), \\(a^4c^4\\), etc., but none of these would have \\(a^2b^2\\). Similarly, \\(4a^3b \\times\\) something would give terms like \\(a^3bc^6\\), \\(a^3bc^4\\), etc., but again, no \\(a^2b^2\\). Only the \\(6a^2b^2\\) term, when multiplied by each term in the second expansion, would give terms involving \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), etc., but the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the sum of all the coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by 6. So, yes, 6 \u00d7 64 = 384.\n\nTherefore, I'm confident that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion is found by considering the binomial expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\n1. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) has a coefficient of \\(\\binom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n2. The sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is obtained by setting \\(c = 1\\), resulting in \\(2^6 = 64\\).\n3. Multiplying these together gives \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{384}"

The question is asking about the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). That means I don't need to worry about the \\(c\\) terms at all, right? Because \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\).

But that seems complicated.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misinterpreting the question. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)\". Hmm, perhaps it's considering the entire expression as a polynomial in \\(a, b, c\\), and it's asking for the coefficient of the term where \\(a\\) is squared, \\(b\\) is squared, and \\(c\\) is to some power. But since the problem doesn't specify anything about \\(c\\), maybe it's just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. But that doesn't make much sense because each term would have \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) multiplied by some power of \\(c\\). Alternatively, maybe the question is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, so the coefficient would be an expression involving \\(c\\). But that seems more complicated than I thought.\n\nWait, no, perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable, so the coefficient would be the product of the coefficients from each part. Let me think again.\n\nSo, the expression is \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let's expand each part separately first.\n\nStarting with \\((a + b)^4\\), using the binomial theorem, the expansion is:\n\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\binom{4}{k} a^{4 - k} b^{k}\n\\]\n\nSo, the term with \\(a^2b^2\\) occurs when \\(4 - k = 2\\), which means \\(k = 2\\). So, the coefficient is \\(\\binom{4}{2}\\), which is 6. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\nNow, the other part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let's expand this using the binomial theorem as well:\n\n\\[\n\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\binom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\binom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n\\]\n\nSo, each term in this expansion is \\(\\binom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\) for \\(m\\) from 0 to 6.\n\nNow, when we multiply the two expansions together, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, resulting in terms like \\(6 a^2b^2 \\times \\binom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\).\n\nBut the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, but in the product, each term is \\(a^2b^2 \\times c^{6 - 2m}\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is actually the sum of all the coefficients from the second expansion, because \\(a^2b^2\\) is being multiplied by each term in the second expansion, each of which has a coefficient that is a constant (with respect to \\(a\\) and \\(b\\)).\n\nWait, but that would mean the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't seem right because the sum of the coefficients in a polynomial is found by setting all variables to 1. So, if I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) becomes \\((1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion is 64.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 64 (the sum of coefficients from the second part), giving 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but that seems a bit high. Let me check if I'm interpreting the problem correctly. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but in the product, each term would be of the form \\(a^2b^2c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, if the question is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then yes, it would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nBut alternatively, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some specific \\(k\\), then we would need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by a specific \\(c^k\\), but the problem doesn't specify \\(k\\), so I think my first interpretation is correct.\n\nWait, but let me think again. When you have two polynomials multiplied together, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each polynomial. But in this case, since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are in one polynomial and \\(c\\) is in the other, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial, because each term in the second polynomial is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\).\n\nWait, but actually, when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial, because each term in the second polynomial contributes a coefficient when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). So, yes, that would be 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nBut let me verify this by considering a simpler example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^1 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, expanding, we have \\((a + b)(c + 1/c) = a c + a/c + b c + b/c\\). The coefficient of \\(a^1b^0\\) would be the coefficient of \\(a\\) times the sum of coefficients in the second polynomial, which is (1 + 1) = 2. So, the coefficient of \\(a\\) in the product would be 1 * 2 = 2. Similarly, the coefficient of \\(b\\) would be 1 * 2 = 2.\n\nWait, but in reality, the coefficient of \\(a c\\) is 1, and the coefficient of \\(a/c\\) is 1, so the coefficient of \\(a\\) in the product, considering all terms, is 1 + 1 = 2, which matches 1 * (1 + 1) = 2. So, that seems to check out.\n\nTherefore, in our original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. Another way to think about it is that when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a term in the product is the sum of the products of coefficients of terms in the first polynomial that multiply to give that term. But in this case, since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are in one polynomial and \\(c\\) is in the other, the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is by taking \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first polynomial and multiplying it by any term from the second polynomial. Therefore, the coefficient would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial, which is indeed 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, if I wanted to compute the entire expansion, I could consider that \\((a + b)^4\\) gives \\(a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\), and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) gives \\(c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15/c^2 + 6/c^4 + 1/c^6\\). Then, when I multiply these two expansions, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) from the first would be multiplied by each term in the second, resulting in \\(6a^2b^2c^6 + 36a^2b^2c^4 + 90a^2b^2c^2 + 120a^2b^2 + 90a^2b^2/c^2 + 36a^2b^2/c^4 + 6a^2b^2/c^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the sum of all the coefficients from the second polynomial, which is 6 + 36 + 90 + 120 + 90 + 36 + 6. Wait, but that's not correct because each term is multiplied by 6, so actually, the coefficients would be 6*1, 6*6, 6*15, 6*20, 6*15, 6*6, 6*1, which adds up to 6*(1 + 6 + 15 + 20 + 15 + 6 + 1) = 6*(64) = 384, which matches our earlier result.\n\nTherefore, I think the coefficient is 384.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the sum inside the second polynomial. The coefficients of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) are:\n\n- \\(c^6\\): coefficient 1\n- \\(c^4\\): coefficient 6\n- \\(c^2\\): coefficient 15\n- \\(c^0\\): coefficient 20\n- \\(c^{-2}\\): coefficient 15\n- \\(c^{-4}\\): coefficient 6\n- \\(c^{-6}\\): coefficient 1\n\nSo, sum of coefficients is 1 + 6 + 15 + 20 + 15 + 6 + 1 = 64, which is correct because it's (1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but another thought: sometimes when you have a product of polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term is the product of the coefficients of the terms that combine to form it. But in this case, since \\(a^2b^2\\) is being multiplied by each term in the second polynomial, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the sum of coefficients from the second part, as we discussed.\n\nSo, yes, I think 384 is the correct answer.\n\nBut just to make sure, let me think about another approach. Let's consider that the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). If we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\), then we can treat \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) as a constant with respect to \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that's essentially what we've been doing.\n\nAlternatively, if we were to collect like terms in the product, each term would have \\(a^k b^{4 - k} c^{6 - 2m}\\), but since the problem is only asking for \\(a^2b^2\\), we can ignore the \\(c\\) terms and just focus on the \\(a^2b^2\\) part, which would be 6 times the sum of coefficients from the second polynomial, which is 64, giving 384.\n\nSo, I think I'm confident that the coefficient is 384.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{384}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem for each part separately.\n\nFirst, consider the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\binom{4}{k} a^{4 - k} b^{k}\n\\]\nThe term with \\(a^2b^2\\) occurs when \\(k = 2\\), giving the coefficient:\n\\[\n\\binom{4}{2} = 6\n\\]\n\nNext, consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem:\n\\[\n\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\binom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\binom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n\\]\nThe sum of all coefficients in this expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives:\n\\[\n(1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\n\\]\n\nWhen multiplying the two expansions together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient is:\n\\[\n6 \\times 64 = 384\n\\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is \\(\\boxed{384}\\)."

    "text": " Hmm, okay. Let me try to figure this out step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that when you have an expression like \\((a + b)^n\\), you can expand it using the binomial theorem. The binomial theorem says that each term in the expansion is of the form \\(\\dbinom{n}{k}a^{n - k}b^k\\), right? So maybe I can apply that here.\n\nIn this problem, we're dealing with \\((a + b)^4\\). So, let's consider expanding that first. The binomial coefficients for \\(n = 4\\) are \\(\\dbinom{4}{0}\\), \\(\\dbinom{4}{1}\\), \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\), \\(\\dbinom{4}{3}\\), and \\(\\dbinom{4}{4}\\), which are 1, 4, 6, 4, and 1 respectively.\n\nSo, the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) would be:\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\dbinom{4}{0}a^4b^0 + \\dbinom{4}{1}a^3b^1 + \\dbinom{4}{2}a^2b^2 + \\dbinom{4}{3}a^1b^3 + \\dbinom{4}{4}a^0b^4\n\\]\nSimplifying that, it becomes:\n\\[\n1 \\cdot a^4 + 4 \\cdot a^3b + 6 \\cdot a^2b^2 + 4 \\cdot ab^3 + 1 \\cdot b^4\n\\]\nSo, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in this part is 6. Okay, that's straightforward.\n\nBut wait, the original problem isn't just \\((a + b)^4\\). It's multiplied by another expression: \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I need to consider how this multiplication affects the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\).\n\nLet me think. When you multiply two expressions, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression. So, in this case, every term from \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by every term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nBut the question is specifically asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). That means we need to find all the terms in the product where the variables are \\(a^2b^2\\) and the other variables (involving \\(c\\)) don't matter for this particular coefficient. So, when we multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first expansion will get multiplied by every term in the second expansion.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but actually, no. Because when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficients multiply for like terms. But since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are different variables from \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) won't interact with the terms involving \\(c\\). So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nWait, that doesn't seem right. Let me clarify. When you have two separate polynomials multiplied together, the terms are combined by adding exponents. But since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are different variables, the exponents don't interfere with each other. So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be the same as the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nBut wait, no, that's not correct either. Because each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), so the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that doesn't make sense because the variables are separate.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think again. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), and when you multiply by the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nWait, but that's not quite right because the coefficients in the second expansion depend on the terms involving \\(c\\). But since \\(c\\) is a different variable, when we're only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, we actually need to consider that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by every term in the second expansion, but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficients from the second expansion will just add up multiplicatively.\n\nWait, no, perhaps I should think of it as the product of two independent expansions. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion and the entire second expansion. But that can't be because the second expansion has multiple terms.\n\nWait, maybe I'm confusing something here. Let me try a different approach. Let's consider the entire expression as \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When we expand this, each term will be of the form \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}a^{4 - k}b^k \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - m}(1/c)^m\\).\n\nSimplifying the second part: \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - m} \\times c^{-m} = \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\).\n\nSo, each term in the product will be \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}\\dbinom{6}{m} a^{4 - k}b^k c^{6 - 2m}\\).\n\nNow, we are interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, let's find the values of \\(k\\) that give \\(a^2b^2\\). In the term \\(a^{4 - k}b^k\\), we have \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). So, \\(k = 2\\).\n\nTherefore, the coefficient from the first part is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n\nNow, for the second part, which is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\), since we are only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), we need to consider that when we multiply by the second expansion, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But since \\(a^2b^2\\) is independent of \\(c\\), the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion.\n\nWait, but that doesn't seem right because the second expansion isn't a constant; it's a polynomial in \\(c\\). So, actually, when we multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, the coefficient will just be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that can't be right because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, not an expression.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question. It says, \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 (c + 1/c)^6\\)?\" So, it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). That is, in the entire expansion, how many times does \\(a^2b^2\\) appear, and what is the sum of all coefficients associated with \\(a^2b^2\\) from all possible terms.\n\nWait, but that can't be because in the expansion, each term is a product of powers of \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\), and \\(1/c\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) can be multiplied by various powers of \\(c\\), but the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the sum of all coefficients from terms where the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) parts are \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) part.\n\nWait, but actually, no. Because in the product, each term is a combination of \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\), and \\(1/c\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) could be multiplied by any power of \\(c\\), but the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't make sense because the coefficient should be a number, not a polynomial.\n\nWait, I'm getting confused. Let me try to think differently. Maybe the question is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times any power of \\(c\\), so effectively, the coefficient would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, so the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But let me check.\n\nWait, no, that's not correct. Because when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficients for specific terms in one polynomial are multiplied by the coefficients of all terms in the other polynomial. But since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that can't be because the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) has multiple terms, each with their own coefficients.\n\nWait, perhaps I should think of it as the product of two independent expansions. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Because when you multiply, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) will be the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all coefficients in the second part.\n\nBut let me verify this. Let's say we have two polynomials: P(a, b) = ... + 6a^2b^2 + ... and Q(c) = ... + terms involving c + ... Then, the product P(a, b) * Q(c) will have terms like 6a^2b^2 * (each term in Q(c)). So, the coefficient of a^2b^2 in the product is 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in Q(c). Because each term in Q(c) will have a coefficient that, when multiplied by 6a^2b^2, will contribute to the coefficient of a^2b^2 in the product.\n\nWait, but actually, no. Because in the product, each term is a combination of a, b, c, etc. So, the coefficient of a^2b^2 in the product is 6 times the entire expansion of Q(c). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Maybe the question is simply asking for the coefficient of a^2b^2 in the entire expression, regardless of the c terms. So, in other words, when you expand the entire expression, how many times does a^2b^2 appear, considering all possible c terms.\n\nBut in reality, in the product, each term is a product of a power of a, a power of b, a power of c, and a power of 1/c. So, the term a^2b^2 can be multiplied by any power of c, but the coefficient of a^2b^2 would be the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion, each multiplied by 6.\n\nWait, that makes sense. So, the coefficient of a^2b^2 in the product is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\).\n\nNow, let's compute the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). The sum of coefficients in a polynomial is found by substituting c = 1. So, let's compute \\(\\left(1 + 1/1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\).\n\nTherefore, the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion is 64.\n\nSo, the coefficient of a^2b^2 in the entire product is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. Because when you substitute c = 1, you get the sum of all coefficients, which is 64. So, when you multiply 6 by 64, you get 384.\n\nBut let me think again. Is the coefficient of a^2b^2 in the product equal to the coefficient of a^2b^2 in the first expansion times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion? That seems correct because each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, so the coefficient of a^2b^2 is 6 times each coefficient in the second expansion, summed up.\n\nAlternatively, if I think of the entire product as a polynomial in a, b, c, and 1/c, then the coefficient of a^2b^2 would indeed be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 64. So, 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of a^2b^2 is 384.\n\nWait, but let me check this with a different approach to be sure. Let's consider that the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). The coefficient of a^2b^2 is the same as the coefficient of a^2b^2 in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient, regardless of the c terms, the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64. So, 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, if I were to expand the entire product, the term a^2b^2 would be present in \\((a + b)^4\\) as 6a^2b^2, and when multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), it would produce terms like 6a^2b^2c^k for various k. But since the question is only asking for the coefficient of a^2b^2, regardless of the c terms, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, giving 384.\n\nYes, I think that's the right answer.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by substituting \\(c = 1\\), resulting in \\(2^6 = 64\\). Multiplying these together gives \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{384}\n\\]"

The binomial theorem says that \\((a + b)^n = \\sum_{k=0}^{n} \\binom{n}{k} a^{n - k} b^{k}\\). So, maybe I can apply that here.\n\nThe problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). That means I need to look at the term where \\(a\\) is squared and \\(b\\) is squared. Since the exponent on \\((a + b)\\) is 4, let's consider that part first.\n\nUsing the binomial theorem on \\((a + b)^4\\), the general term is \\(\\binom{4}{k} a^{4 - k} b^{k}\\). I need the term where \\(a^2b^2\\), so that would be when \\(4 - k = 2\\) for \\(a\\), which means \\(k = 2\\). So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is \\(\\binom{4}{2}\\).\n\nCalculating that, \\(\\binom{4}{2} = \\frac{4!}{2!2!} = \\frac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient from the first part is 6.\n\nNow, the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait a minute, but the question is about the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are in the first part, and \\(c\\) is in the second part, does that mean the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just 6 times whatever the constant term is in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)? Because if I multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by something else, it won't affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, unless the second part has terms that can combine with it. Wait, no, actually, when you multiply two polynomials, each term from the first polynomial is multiplied by each term from the second. So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I need to consider all the ways that \\(a^2b^2\\) can be multiplied by terms from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, actually, no. Because \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term in the first part, and when you multiply by the second part, each term from the first is multiplied by each term from the second.

Hmm, maybe not.\n\nWait, let me think again. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression. So, actually, when you expand the product, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second part, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part.

Let me read the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, the expression is a product of two polynomials: one in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the other in \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). When you multiply these two, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second part, which are terms like \\(c^6\\), \\(c^4\\), ..., \\(c^{-6}\\).

Alternatively, maybe the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating \\(c\\) as a variable, so the coefficient would indeed be a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem didn't specify any particular power of \\(c\\), so maybe that's the case. Hmm.\n\nWait, let me check the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, perhaps the coefficient is the entire expression from the second part, multiplied by 6. So, the coefficient would be 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems unlikely because the problem is asking for a coefficient, which is typically a numerical value, not an expression.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Maybe the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, so the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second part. But that doesn't make sense because the second part isn't just a constant; it's a polynomial in \\(c\\). Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times the constant term in the second part, so that the resulting term is \\(a^2b^2\\) times 1 (the constant term). So, the coefficient would be 6 times the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). That makes sense because if we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, but I think the problem might actually be looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), i.e., the constant term. So, perhaps that's the intended interpretation.\n\nLet me proceed under that assumption. So, first, find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6. Then, find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Multiply those two together to get the coefficient.\n\nSo, let's find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem again, the expansion is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\binom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\binom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\).\n\nWe need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, i.e., \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(k = 3\\). So, the constant term is \\(\\binom{6}{3}\\).\n\nCalculating that, \\(\\binom{6}{3} = \\frac{6!}{3!3!} = \\frac{720}{6*6} = \\frac{720}{36} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not missing anything. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so if we consider the entire expansion, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second part, but when we collect like terms, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) will be the sum of all the coefficients from the second part multiplied by 6. But wait, no, that's not correct because each term from the second part is a separate term, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would actually be 6 times the entire expansion of the second part. But that can't be right because the coefficient should be a number, not a polynomial.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating again. Let me think differently. If we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then it would indeed be 6 times the entire expansion of the second part, but that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem is probably expecting a numerical coefficient, so perhaps it's intended to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), which is the constant term. So, that would be 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without considering \\(c\\), then it's 6 times the entire expansion of the second part, but that seems unlikely because the problem would probably specify if it wanted a polynomial coefficient.\n\nWait, let me check the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, perhaps the problem is considering \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\), and \\(1/c\\) as variables, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the sum of all terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any power of \\(c\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which seems odd. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), i.e., the constant term. That makes more sense, so I think that's what is intended.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but let me confirm. Let's consider the entire expansion. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\) with coefficient 6. Then, when multiplied by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in that expansion is multiplied by 6. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, not a single number. Therefore, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times the constant term in the second part, which would be 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times any power of \\(c\\), but that would make the coefficient a polynomial, which seems unlikely. So, I think the intended interpretation is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nWait, but let me think again. If I have two separate polynomials multiplied together, one in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the other in \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), then when I multiply them, each term from the first is multiplied by each term from the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second part, which are \\(c^6\\), \\(c^4\\), \\(c^2\\), \\(c^0\\), \\(c^{-2}\\), \\(c^{-4}\\), \\(c^{-6}\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be 6 times the entire expansion of the second part, meaning that the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would be that entire polynomial. However, if the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, it's probably referring to the constant term, i.e., the coefficient when multiplied by \\(c^0\\). So, that would be 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, but that would still be a polynomial. Hmm.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is miswritten, and it's supposed to be \\((a + b + c)^4\\), but no, it's \\((a + b)^4(c + 1/c)^6\\). So, given that, I think the intended answer is 120, considering the constant term.\n\nSo, to recap: The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\) is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but let me make sure that I'm not missing any other terms. Suppose I expand both parts:\n\n\\((a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\).\n\n\\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15/c^2 + 6/c^4 + 1/c^6\\).\n\nWhen I multiply these two, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second part, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be 6 times each of those terms. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^6\\) is 6*1, coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^4\\) is 6*6, coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^2\\) is 6*15, coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is 6*20, and so on.\n\nBut the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), without specifying any power of \\(c\\). So, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times the sum of all possible \\(c\\) terms, which would be 6*(1 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15/c^2 + 6/c^4 + 1/c^6). But that would make the coefficient a polynomial, which doesn't make much sense unless specified.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), which is 120. That seems more likely, as it's a numerical coefficient.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is intended to be read as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, considering all possible terms, but that would still require knowing the power of \\(c\\). So, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), which would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that seems odd because then the coefficient is a polynomial, not a number.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating again. Maybe the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, so the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of the second part. But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, which is not a single number. So, perhaps the problem is miswritten, or I'm misinterpreting it.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating \\(c\\) as a variable, but the problem didn't specify any particular power of \\(c\\). So, perhaps the answer is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but that seems unlikely.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), which is 120. That seems plausible. So, I think that's the intended answer.\n\nSo, to summarize:\n\n1. Find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6.\n2. Find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 20.\n3. Multiply them together to get 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) (assuming it's multiplied by \\(c^0\\)) is 120.\n\nWait, but let me check again. If I have \\((a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\), and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15/c^2 + 6/c^4 + 1/c^6\\), then when I multiply them, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^6\\) is 6*1, coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^4\\) is 6*6, and so on, up to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2/c^6\\) is 6*1.\n\nBut the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would include all those terms. So, unless the problem specifies a particular power of \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is a polynomial in \\(c\\). Therefore, the answer is 6*(c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15/c^2 + 6/c^4 + 1/c^6). But that seems unlikely because the problem is asking for a coefficient, which is typically a number.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating \\(c\\) as a variable, but only considering the constant term in \\(c\\). So, that would be 6*20 = 120.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of \\(c\\), which would mean summing over all possible \\(c\\) terms. But that would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which is 6*(1 + 6 + 15 + 20 + 15 + 6 + 1) = 6*64 = 384. But that seems too large, and I don't think that's what the problem is asking.\n\nWait, perhaps I should look at the problem again. It says, \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, perhaps the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, so the coefficient would be 6 times the expansion of the second part. But that's a polynomial, not a number. So, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times the term where \\(c\\) cancels out, i.e., \\(c^0\\), which would be 120.\n\nI think that's the most plausible interpretation. So, the answer is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Multiplying these together gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is 120, so \\boxed{120}."

    "text": " Wait, but actually, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but in the expression given, the variables are \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\), and \\(1/c\\). So, I'm a bit confused because \\(a^2b^2\\) only involves \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), but the other part of the expression involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). Does that mean the coefficient is just from the \\((a + b)^4\\) part? Or do I need to consider both parts?\n\nWait, let me think. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, when they ask for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I think they mean the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by any terms from the \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) part. But actually, \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), so the coefficient would just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Hmm, no, that doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is only in terms of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), so maybe the \\(c\\) terms don't affect it. Wait, no, because the entire expression is a product, so maybe the coefficient is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times the sum of all coefficients from the \\(c\\) terms. But that might not be right. Let me think again.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), because otherwise, the \\(c\\) terms would make it impossible to have a term with just \\(a^2b^2\\). Because in the product, each term would be a combination of \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\), and \\(1/c\\). So, perhaps the problem is implicitly asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), meaning the constant term with respect to \\(c\\). That makes sense because otherwise, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by some power of \\(c\\), and the problem might be asking for the total coefficient when considering all possible \\(c\\) terms. But the problem as stated is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so perhaps I'm overcomplicating it.\n\nWait, maybe I should just consider the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and then multiply it by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\).

So perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times the constant term (with respect to \\(c\\)) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). That would make sense because then the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by the constant term from the other part, resulting in a term that is just \\(a^2b^2\\), and the coefficient would be the product of the two coefficients.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), ignoring the \\(c\\) terms, but that seems unlikely because the expression includes both parts. So perhaps I should proceed by first finding the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and then find the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), and then multiply them together. Wait, but the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) would be found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). But I'm not sure if that's what the problem wants because it's not clear whether the problem wants the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times the entire expression or just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\).\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, meaning that any term in the product that has \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by any power of \\(c\\) would contribute to the coefficient. But that doesn't make sense because then the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\), which isn't a numerical value. So maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), that is, the constant term with respect to \\(c\\). That seems more plausible.\n\nSo, let me break it down. First, I'll find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\). Then, I'll find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Finally, I'll multiply these two coefficients together to get the final coefficient for \\(a^2b^2c^0\\).\n\nStarting with \\((a + b)^4\\), the expansion is given by the binomial theorem:\n\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\binom{4}{k} a^{4 - k} b^{k}\n\\]\n\nWe need the term where \\(a^2b^2\\), which corresponds to \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). So, the coefficient is \\(\\binom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n\nNext, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Again, using the binomial theorem:\n\n\\[\n\\left(c + \\frac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\binom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\frac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\binom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n\\]\n\nWe want the exponent of \\(c\\) to be 0, so we set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\):\n\n\\[\n6 - 2m = 0 \\implies 2m = 6 \\implies m = 3\n\\]\n\nSo, the coefficient is \\(\\binom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n\nNow, the overall coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is the product of the two coefficients we found:\n\n\\[\n6 \\times 20 = 120\n\\]\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. Is it correct to multiply the coefficients from each part? Because when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficients multiply when the terms multiply. So, yes, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part is 20, so when you multiply the two parts together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by the constant term 20, giving a total coefficient of 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem was only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without considering the \\(c\\) terms, then the answer would just be 6, but that seems unlikely because the expression includes both parts. So, I think the correct approach is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nWait, but let me check again. If I consider the entire product, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second part, which includes various powers of \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which might imply that we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. But that would mean summing over all possible \\(c\\) exponents, which isn't possible because each term would have a different power of \\(c\\). So, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is the term where the powers of \\(c\\) cancel out, resulting in a term that is just \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient would be 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So, the final answer is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\frac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Multiplying these gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\boxed{120}"

    "text": " Hmm, that seems a bit involved, but let me try to break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I know that when expanding expressions like \\((a + b)^n\\), we can use the binomial theorem. The binomial theorem says that \\((a + b)^n = \\sum_{k=0}^{n} \\binom{n}{k} a^{n - k}b^{k}\\). So, maybe I can apply that here.\n\nThe problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\). Let me focus on that part first. So, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the general term is \\(\\binom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^{k}\\). I need the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2. That would mean \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). So, the coefficient is \\(\\binom{4}{2}\\).\n\nCalculating that, \\(\\binom{4}{2} = \\frac{4!}{2!2!} = \\frac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. Okay, that part seems straightforward.\n\nNow, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term comes from \\((a + b)^4\\), and it's being multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), right? So, does that mean I don't need to worry about the \\(c\\) terms? Or do I need to consider how the \\(c\\) terms interact?\n\nLet me think. When we multiply two polynomials, each term in the first polynomial gets multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), maybe the \\(c\\) terms will just contribute a factor that's multiplied by the coefficient we found earlier.\n\nWait, but actually, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by every term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't seem right because the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) would involve terms with different powers of \\(c\\), and we might not be looking for a specific term.\n\nWait, no, actually, the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), it would be multiplied by the constant term (if any) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because if we have \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by, say, \\(c^3\\), that would give \\(a^2b^2c^3\\), which is a different term. But if we want only the \\(a^2b^2\\) term, then we need the part of the product where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out, i.e., where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero.\n\nSo, in other words, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is equal to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). That makes sense because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by \\(c^0\\), you just get \\(a^2b^2\\), which is the term we're interested in.\n\nSo, now I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let's work on that.\n\nAgain, using the binomial theorem, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\binom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying each term, that becomes \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\binom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m} = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\binom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\).\n\nWe need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0. So, set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\binom{6}{3}\\).\n\nCalculating that, \\(\\binom{6}{3} = \\frac{6!}{3!3!} = \\frac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\frac{720}{36} = 20\\). Wait, that's not right. Wait, 6! is 720, but 3! is 6, so 3!3! is 6\u00d76=36. So, 720 divided by 36 is indeed 20. So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficients we found: 6 (from \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\)) multiplied by 20 (from \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)). So, 6 \u00d7 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake here. So, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6. In \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the constant term is 20. So when we multiply these two expressions, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term is multiplied by 20, so the coefficient becomes 6 \u00d7 20 = 120. That seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of it another way. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are different variables, the terms in the product will have terms involving combinations of these variables. But since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the only way to get a term with \\(a^2b^2\\) is to multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part by the constant term (in terms of \\(c\\)) from the second part. So, yes, that makes sense.\n\nLet me check my calculations again to be thorough. So, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\binom{4}{2}\\), which is 6. Correct. In \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the general term is \\(\\binom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We set the exponent equal to zero, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), giving \\(m = 3\\). The coefficient is \\(\\binom{6}{3} = 20\\). Correct.\n\nMultiplying 6 and 20 gives 120. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120. That seems correct.\n\nWait, another way to think about it: when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each polynomial, provided that the variables don't interfere. Since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), and the constant term in the second polynomial is 20, then yes, the coefficient should be 6 \u00d7 20 = 120.\n\nI think that makes sense. So, I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break down the problem into two parts using the binomial theorem.\n\n1. **Finding the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\):**\n   Using the binomial theorem, the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is given by:\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\binom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^{k}\n   \\]\n   The term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\), so the coefficient is:\n   \\[\n   \\binom{4}{2} = \\frac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\n   \\]\n\n2. **Finding the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   Using the binomial theorem, the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is given by:\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\binom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\binom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n   \\]\n   We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0. Setting \\(6 - 2m = 0\\) gives \\(m = 3\\). The coefficient is:\n   \\[\n   \\binom{6}{3} = \\frac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\n   \\]\n\n3. **Combining the results:**\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficients found:\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 20 = 120\n   \\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

    "text": " Hmm, that seems a bit involved, but I think I can break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that when you expand a binomial like \\((a + b)^n\\), you can use the binomial theorem. The binomial theorem says that \\((a + b)^n = \\sum_{k=0}^{n} \\binom{n}{k} a^{n - k} b^k\\). So, in this case, for \\((a + b)^4\\), I can write it as the sum from \\(k=0\\) to \\(4\\) of \\(\\binom{4}{k} a^{4 - k} b^k\\).\n\nNow, the problem asks for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). That means I need to find the term where the power of \\(a\\) is 2 and the power of \\(b\\) is 2. Let me think: in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\), each term is of the form \\(\\binom{4}{k} a^{4 - k} b^k\\). So, if I want \\(a^2b^2\\), then \\(4 - k = 2\\) for \\(a\\) and \\(k = 2\\) for \\(b\\). That makes sense because \\(4 - 2 = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\).\n\nSo, plugging \\(k = 2\\) into the binomial coefficient, I get \\(\\binom{4}{2}\\). I know that \\(\\binom{4}{2} = 6\\). So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. That part seems straightforward.\n\nBut wait, the original expression isn't just \\((a + b)^4\\); it's multiplied by another binomial, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I need to consider how this multiplication affects the coefficient I found.\n\nLet me write out the entire expression: \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Since multiplication is commutative and associative, I can think of this as the product of two separate expansions.\n\nSo, to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I need to consider how the terms from each expansion multiply together. However, I notice that the terms from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) don't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\). They only involve \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). That means when I multiply the two expansions together, the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) will be multiplied by terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\).\n\nBut wait, the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, does that mean I don't need to consider the terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\)? Hmm, maybe not. Let me think about this.\n\nIn the product \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term from \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\), and \\(1/c\\) are all different variables, the only way a term will have both \\(a^2b^2\\) and some combination of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) is if we take the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first expansion and multiply it by every possible term from the second expansion.\n\nHowever, the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). That suggests that we're only interested in the terms where the variables \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are present as \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). But wait, actually, no, because each term in the product will have both \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms and \\(c\\) terms. So, if we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), we need to consider all possible terms in the product that result in \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by some power of \\(c\\). But the problem doesn't specify any condition on \\(c\\), so perhaps the question is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), meaning that we can treat the second expansion as a scalar multiple when considering the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\).\n\nWait, that might not be the right way to think about it. Let me clarify: when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion will be multiplied by every term in the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, the coefficients add up.\n\nWait, is that correct? Let me think again. Suppose I have \\(P(a, b) = (a + b)^4\\) and \\(Q(c) = \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Then the product \\(P(a, b) \\times Q(c)\\) will have terms like \\(a^kb^{4 - k} \\times c^m\\) or \\(a^kb^{4 - k} \\times c^{-m}\\), where \\(k\\) ranges from 0 to 4 and \\(m\\) ranges based on the expansion of \\(Q(c)\\).\n\nBut the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in the product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) can be multiplied by any power of \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is actually the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(P(a, b)\\) multiplied by the entire expansion \\(Q(c)\\). But since \\(Q(c)\\) is a polynomial in \\(c\\), when we multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by \\(Q(c)\\), it's like scaling \\(a^2b^2\\) by the entire \\(Q(c)\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(P(a, b)\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(Q(c)\\).\n\nWait, that might not be right. Let me think again. No, actually, each term in \\(P(a, b)\\) is a monomial in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and each term in \\(Q(c)\\) is a monomial in \\(c\\). So, when you multiply them, each term in the product is a monomial in \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(P(a, b)\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(Q(c)\\), resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^m\\) or \\(a^2b^2c^{-m}\\). Therefore, in the product, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) (regardless of the power of \\(c\\)) is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(P(a, b)\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(Q(c)\\). Because each term in \\(Q(c)\\) contributes its own coefficient when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\).\n\nBut wait, actually, no. Because \\(Q(c)\\) is a separate variable, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(P(a, b)\\) times the entire \\(Q(c)\\). But since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), the coefficient would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(P(a, b)\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(Q(c)\\). Because each term in \\(Q(c)\\) contributes to the coefficient when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\).\n\nWait, that still doesn't seem quite right. Let me try a different approach. Let me denote the entire product as:\n\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\left(\\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\binom{4}{k} a^{4 - k} b^k\\right) \\times \\left(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\binom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\right)\n\\]\n\nSimplifying the second sum:\n\n\\[\n\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\binom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n\\]\n\nSo, the entire product becomes:\n\n\\[\n\\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\binom{4}{k} \\binom{6}{m} a^{4 - k} b^k c^{6 - 2m}\n\\]\n\nNow, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, we need to find all terms where the exponents of \\(a\\) is 2 and the exponent of \\(b\\) is 2. That means in the double sum, we need \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). So, as before, \\(k = 2\\). So, the coefficient from the first sum is \\(\\binom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n\nNow, the exponent of \\(c\\) in each term is \\(6 - 2m\\). But since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the exponent of \\(c\\), the total coefficient will be the sum over all \\(m\\) of \\(\\binom{6}{m}\\) multiplied by 6. So, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\binom{6}{m}\\).\n\nWait, but \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\binom{6}{m} = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the coefficient would be \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\nBut wait, is that correct? Let me make sure. So, for each term in the first expansion where \\(a^2b^2\\) occurs, which has coefficient 6, we multiply it by each term in the second expansion, which has coefficients \\(\\binom{6}{m}\\). So, the total coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) across all possible \\(c\\) terms is \\(6 \\times (2^6) = 6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\nBut wait, the problem didn't specify any condition on \\(c\\), so it's just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, yes, that would be 384.\n\nAlternatively, another way to think about it is that since \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) are separate variables, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, effectively, it's scaling the coefficient by the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is indeed \\(2^6 = 64\\).\n\nTherefore, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\nWait, but let me double-check this. Let me compute \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem, it's \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\binom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\times (1/c)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\binom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the sum of all coefficients in this expansion is when we set \\(c = 1\\). Then, \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of all coefficients is indeed 64.\n\nTherefore, when we multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nSo, I think that's the answer. But let me just go through it again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\n1. Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem: \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\binom{4}{k} a^{4 - k} b^k\\).\n2. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\binom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n3. Now, consider \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). The sum of all coefficients in this expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\(2^6 = 64\\).\n4. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is \\(6 * 64 = 384\\).\n\nYes, that seems correct. I don't see any mistakes in that reasoning.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(2^6 = 64\\). Multiplying these together gives \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n$\\boxed{384}$"

That means I need to find the term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) where \\(a\\) is squared and \\(b\\) is squared. Let me write that down.\n\nSo, for \\((a + b)^4\\), the general term is \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k} b^{k}\\). I want the term where \\(a^2b^2\\), so that would mean \\(4 - k = 2\\) for \\(a\\), which implies \\(k = 2\\).

So, I need to consider that entire product. But the question is only about the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Hmm, does that mean I don't need to worry about the \\(c\\) terms?

When you multiply two polynomials, each term from the first polynomial gets multiplied by each term from the second polynomial. But since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\), and \\(1/c\\) are different variables, the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) won't interact with the terms involving \\(c\\) except through multiplication.\n\nSo, when we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), we're essentially looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), and then multiplying it by the entire expansion of the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\) at all.\n\nWait, no, that might not be right. Let me clarify. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\), and when we multiply by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), when we multiply it by the second polynomial, it will be multiplied by every term in the second polynomial, effectively distributing across all terms.\n\nHowever, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but since \\(a^2b^2\\) is being multiplied by all the terms in the second polynomial, each of those terms would have different powers of \\(c\\). But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not considering the \\(c\\) terms. Hmm, that's a bit confusing.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Maybe the question is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, in other words, when you expand the entire expression, what's the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), treating \\(c\\) as another variable.\n\nBut that seems a bit odd because \\(c\\) is a separate variable. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, ignoring the \\(c\\) terms, but that seems unlikely because the entire expression is given as the product.\n\nWait, let me read the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, it's the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term in the product. Since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), when you multiply the two polynomials, the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) is by multiplying the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from \\((a + b)^4\\) by any term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nBut that doesn't make sense because the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would then be a polynomial in \\(c\\), not a single number. So, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating \\(c\\) as a variable, so that the coefficient could be an expression involving \\(c\\). But that seems unusual because typically, when someone asks for the coefficient of a term, they might be considering all variables. Alternatively, perhaps the question is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, meaning that it's just the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, multiplied by the entire second polynomial, but that would make the coefficient a polynomial, not a number.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when considering the entire expansion, but only looking at terms where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out, i.e., where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. Because if you have a term \\(a^2b^2c^k \\times c^{-m}\\), then to get a term with just \\(a^2b^2\\), you need \\(k - m = 0\\), so \\(k = m\\). Therefore, the coefficient would be the sum over all such terms where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out.\n\nWait, that might make sense. So, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, which would involve summing over all possible terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^k \\times c^{-k}\\), i.e., \\(c^0\\), so effectively, the constant term with respect to \\(c\\).\n\nSo, in other words, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because when you multiply the two expansions, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first will be multiplied by each term in the second, and only the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero will result in a term that's just \\(a^2b^2\\), without any \\(c\\) terms.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient would be 6 (from the \\(a^2b^2\\) term) multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nLet me compute that. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) can be done using the binomial theorem as well. The general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\).\n\nWe need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be zero, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\).\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\).\n\nCalculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\).\n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nWait, let me double-check that. So, in the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. In the second part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. When you multiply these two, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by the constant term from the second part, resulting in \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion is 120.\n\nBut wait, is that the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\)? Let me think. When you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) can only come from \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by any term in the second part, but since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, that would mean we have to consider all possible terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^k\\), but since the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, perhaps I was wrong earlier.\n\nWait, no, that doesn't make sense because \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term in the product, but in reality, when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second, so the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be part of the product, but it would be multiplied by all possible terms from the second polynomial. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would actually be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial multiplied by the entire second polynomial. But that would make the coefficient a polynomial in \\(c\\), not a constant.\n\nBut the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so perhaps it's just considering the part from the first polynomial, ignoring the \\(c\\) terms. But that seems odd because the entire expression is given as the product.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\). That would make sense because then the coefficient would be a constant, 120, as I calculated earlier.\n\nBut the problem didn't specify anything about \\(c\\), so maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me read the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, it's just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. That would mean that we're treating \\(c\\) as another variable, so the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\).\n\nBut that seems unlikely because the problem is probably expecting a numerical answer. Therefore, perhaps the intended interpretation is that we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when considering the entire expansion, but only for the terms where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out, i.e., the constant term with respect to \\(c\\).\n\nIn that case, as I calculated earlier, the coefficient would be 6 (from \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial) multiplied by 20 (the constant term in the second polynomial), resulting in 120.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem is indeed asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, then the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which would make the coefficient a polynomial in \\(c\\), but that seems unlikely because the problem is probably expecting a numerical answer.\n\nTherefore, I think the intended interpretation is that we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, considering only the terms where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out, i.e., the constant term with respect to \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient is 120.\n\nWait, but let me make sure. Let's consider the entire expansion:\n\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\n\\]\n\\[\n\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = c^6 + 6c^5 \\cdot \\dfrac{1}{c} + 15c^4 \\cdot \\dfrac{1}{c^2} + 20c^3 \\cdot \\dfrac{1}{c^3} + 15c^2 \\cdot \\dfrac{1}{c^4} + 6c \\cdot \\dfrac{1}{c^5} + \\dfrac{1}{c^6}\n\\]\nSimplifying the second expansion:\n\\[\nc^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15c^{-2} + 6c^{-4} + c^{-6}\n\\]\n\nNow, when we multiply these two expansions together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first polynomial will be multiplied by each term in the second polynomial, resulting in:\n\n\\(6a^2b^2c^6 + 6a^2b^2 \\times 6c^4 + 6a^2b^2 \\times 15c^2 + 6a^2b^2 \\times 20 + 6a^2b^2 \\times 15c^{-2} + 6a^2b^2 \\times 6c^{-4} + 6a^2b^2 \\times c^{-6}\\)\n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion is indeed a polynomial in \\(c\\), but if we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), it would be 6 times the entire second polynomial, which is a polynomial. However, if we're only interested in the constant term with respect to \\(c\\), then it's 6 times 20, which is 120.\n\nGiven that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without specifying anything about \\(c\\), it's ambiguous. But considering the way the problem is phrased, it's likely that they want the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when considering the entire product, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, which would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). However, that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, not a single number.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be 120.\n\nGiven that, I think the intended answer is 120, so I'll go with that.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Multiplying these gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}."

    "text": " Hmm, that sounds like it involves binomial expansions. Let me try to remember how that works.\n\nFirst, I think I should handle each part separately. The expression is a product of two binomials raised to powers, so maybe I can expand each one separately and then multiply them together. But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), maybe I don't need to expand everything. That could save some time.\n\nLet me start with the first part: \\((a + b)^4\\). I know that the binomial expansion of \\((a + b)^n\\) is the sum from \\(k = 0\\) to \\(n\\) of \\(\\binom{n}{k} a^{n - k} b^k\\). So for \\((a + b)^4\\), the expansion would be:\n\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\binom{4}{k} a^{4 - k} b^k\n\\]\n\nI need the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which means I need the term where \\(a^2\\) and \\(b^2\\) appear. So, let's find the value of \\(k\\) that gives \\(b^2\\). Since the exponent of \\(b\\) is \\(k\\), then \\(k = 2\\). So the term is:\n\n\\[\n\\binom{4}{2} a^{4 - 2} b^2 = \\binom{4}{2} a^2 b^2\n\\]\n\nCalculating the binomial coefficient \\(\\binom{4}{2}\\), which is \\(\\frac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\\). So the coefficient here is 6.\n\nOkay, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. Now, moving on to the second part: \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nI need to figure out how this part affects the coefficient. Since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I might not need to consider the terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) unless they somehow influence the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. Wait, but actually, the entire expression is a product of two parts: \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So when I multiply them together, each term from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term from the second expansion.\n\nBut since the problem is asking specifically for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I need to consider whether any terms from the second expansion will affect this coefficient. Wait, actually, no. Because \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), so when I multiply, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term from the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire second part. But wait, that doesn't seem right because the second part is raised to the 6th power, so it's a sum of terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\).\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think again. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by every term from the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients from the second part, because each term in the second part contributes to the coefficient when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\).\n\nWait, no, that might not be correct. Because when you multiply two expressions, each term from the first is multiplied by each term from the second, so the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum of the products of the coefficients of terms that combine to form that specific term. But in this case, since we're only looking for \\(a^2b^2\\), and the second part doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), the terms from the second part just get multiplied by the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire second expansion. But that doesn't make sense because the second expansion is a sum, not a single term.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. Let me clarify. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When you expand this, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term from the second part. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients in the second part, because each term from the second part contributes to the coefficient when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\).\n\nWait, but that would mean that the coefficient is 6 multiplied by the sum of the coefficients of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't seem right because the sum of the coefficients of a polynomial is found by setting all variables to 1. So, let me calculate the sum of the coefficients of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nTo find the sum of the coefficients, we can substitute \\(c = 1\\):\n\n\\[\n\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = (1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\n\\]\n\nSo, the sum of the coefficients is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times 64, which is 384.\n\nWait, but that seems too straightforward. Let me check again. Is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product equal to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of the coefficients in the second part?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider that when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term is the product of the coefficients of the terms that combine to form it. But in this case, since \\(a^2b^2\\) is only from the first part and the second part doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), every term from the second part will multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term, so the coefficient becomes 6 multiplied by the entire second expansion. But the second expansion is a sum, so when you multiply by 6, each term in the second expansion contributes 6 times its coefficient to the overall coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\).\n\nWait, but that's not quite accurate because the second expansion is a sum of terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), so when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, you get terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) where \\(k\\) varies. But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. Wait, no, actually, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but in the entire product, \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by various powers of \\(c\\), so the term \\(a^2b^2\\) itself is just one term, and its coefficient would be the sum of all the coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by 6.\n\nWait, I'm getting confused. Let me think differently. The entire expression is:\n\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\left(\\sum_{i=0}^4 \\binom{4}{i} a^{4-i}b^i\\right) \\times \\left(\\sum_{j=0}^6 \\binom{6}{j} c^{6-j} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^j\\right)\n\\]\n\nSimplifying the second sum:\n\n\\[\n\\sum_{j=0}^6 \\binom{6}{j} c^{6-j} c^{-j} = \\sum_{j=0}^6 \\binom{6}{j} c^{6 - 2j}\n\\]\n\nSo, the entire product becomes:\n\n\\[\n\\sum_{i=0}^4 \\sum_{j=0}^6 \\binom{4}{i}\\binom{6}{j} a^{4-i}b^i c^{6 - 2j}\n\\]\n\nNow, the problem asks for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, we need the terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) appears, which means \\(4 - i = 2\\) and \\(i = 2\\). So, \\(i = 2\\). Therefore, the coefficient is:\n\n\\[\n\\binom{4}{2} \\times \\sum_{j=0}^6 \\binom{6}{j}\n\\]\n\nWait, but that's not correct because for each \\(j\\), we have a term \\(c^{6 - 2j}\\), but the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients from the second part, because each term in the second part contributes to the coefficient when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\).\n\nWait, but the second part's coefficients are not just a single number; they are spread out over different powers of \\(c\\). However, since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the entire second expansion's contribution, but that seems like it would be an infinite series, which doesn't make sense.\n\nWait, no, actually, when you multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), each term in the second expansion is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the entire second expansion. But that can't be right because the second expansion is a polynomial in \\(c\\), so when you multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), you get terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), but the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would actually be zero unless \\(k = 0\\), because otherwise, the term would have \\(c^k\\) attached.\n\nWait, that makes more sense. So, actually, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, but without considering the \\(c\\) terms. So, we need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by \\(c^0\\), because only then would the term be \\(a^2b^2\\). So, we need to find the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\), which means we need to find the coefficient from the first part (which is 6) multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part.\n\nSo, first, let me confirm: the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, which includes terms with \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). But if we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, that would mean we're looking for all terms where the power of \\(a\\) is 2, the power of \\(b\\) is 2, and the power of \\(c\\) is 0. Because any other power of \\(c\\) would make the term something like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), which isn't just \\(a^2b^2\\). So, to get the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), we need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient is the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part.\n\nSo, let's compute that.\n\nFirst, we already found that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\nNow, we need the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let's find that.\n\nThe expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is:\n\n\\[\n\\sum_{j=0}^6 \\binom{6}{j} c^{6 - j} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^j = \\sum_{j=0}^6 \\binom{6}{j} c^{6 - 2j}\n\\]\n\nWe need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so:\n\n\\[\n6 - 2j = 0 \\implies j = 3\n\\]\n\nSo, the coefficient is \\(\\binom{6}{3}\\), which is 20.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part is 20.\n\nNow, multiplying the two coefficients together, we get:\n\n\\[\n6 \\times 20 = 120\n\\]\n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 120.\n\nWait, let me double-check that. So, in the first part, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. In the second part, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Therefore, when we multiply these two parts, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is 6 * 20 = 120. That seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, if I think of the entire product as:\n\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\text{[something]} \\times \\text{[something else]}\n\\]\n\nThe term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first part, and to get \\(c^0\\), we need the term where \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) multiply to \\(c^0\\), which is when \\(j = 3\\), as we found. So, yes, 20 is the correct coefficient for \\(c^0\\), and 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then finding the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20. Multiplying these gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\boxed{120}."

    "text": " Hmm, that sounds a bit tricky, but let me break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that when expanding expressions like \\((a + b)^n\\), we can use the binomial theorem. The binomial theorem says that \\((a + b)^n = \\sum_{k=0}^{n} \\binom{n}{k} a^{n - k} b^{k}\\). So, for the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), I can expand it using this theorem.\n\nLet me write that out. The expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) will have terms from \\(a^4\\) down to \\(b^4\\). The coefficients will be the binomial coefficients for \\(n = 4\\). So, the expansion is:\n\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\binom{4}{0}a^4 + \\binom{4}{1}a^3b + \\binom{4}{2}a^2b^2 + \\binom{4}{3}ab^3 + \\binom{4}{4}b^4\n\\]\n\nCalculating the binomial coefficients, we have:\n\n- \\(\\binom{4}{0} = 1\\)\n- \\(\\binom{4}{1} = 4\\)\n- \\(\\binom{4}{2} = 6\\)\n- \\(\\binom{4}{3} = 4\\)\n- \\(\\binom{4}{4} = 1\\)\n\nSo, the expansion becomes:\n\n\\[\na^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\n\\]\n\nLooking at this, the term with \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(6a^2b^2\\), so the coefficient is 6. But wait, the problem isn't just about \\((a + b)^4\\); it's multiplied by another expression, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I need to consider how this multiplication affects the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\).\n\nLet me denote the entire expression as \\(E = (a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Since multiplication is involved, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(E\\) will be the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficients multiply.\n\nWait, no, actually, that might not be entirely accurate. Let me think again. When you multiply two expressions, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression. So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which comes from \\((a + b)^4\\), then I need to consider how it interacts with the other part.\n\nBut actually, the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms are independent of the \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) terms. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression \\(E\\) will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, no, that's not correct because the entire expression is a product, so each term from \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nBut the problem is asking specifically for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, that term comes only from the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is \\(6a^2b^2\\), multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nWait, but that doesn't sound right either because when you multiply \\(6a^2b^2\\) by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), you get terms like \\(6a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(6a^2b^2c^5\\), etc., each with their own coefficients. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some k. Hmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the powers of c. So, when you expand the entire expression, any term that has \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by any power of c and 1/c will contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) has a coefficient, and when multiplied by 6a^2b^2, it contributes to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product.\n\nWait, but the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), right? Because substituting \\(c = 1\\) makes each term's coefficient appear as a constant, so the sum is the value of the expression at \\(c = 1\\).\n\nSo, let me calculate that. \\(\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = (1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 64.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression \\(E\\) is 6 (from \\((a + b)^4\\)) multiplied by 64 (the sum of coefficients from the other part), which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but that seems high. Let me verify this approach again. Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and since the other part is multiplied by it, but the other part's terms don't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms, so maybe the coefficient remains 6. But that can't be right because when you multiply two expressions, the coefficients multiply.\n\nWait, no, perhaps I'm confusing things. Let me think differently. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from \\((a + b)^4\\), and when you multiply it by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the other expansion, which is 64, as I found earlier. So, 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nBut let me check with a smaller example to see if this approach is correct. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, \\((a + b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2\\), and \\((c + 1/c)^1 = c + 1/c\\). The product would be:\n\n(a^2 + 2ab + b^2)(c + 1/c) = a^2c + a^2/c + 2abc + 2ab/c + b^2c + b^2/c.\n\nNow, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in this product is zero because there are no \\(a^2b^2\\) terms. Wait, that's confusing because in this case, the product doesn't have \\(a^2b^2\\) terms, so the coefficient is zero. But according to my previous approach, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^2\\) is 0 (since the expansion is \\(a^2 + 2ab + b^2\\)), so 0 times the sum of coefficients in \\((c + 1/c)^1\\), which is 2, would be 0, which matches.\n\nWait, but in the original problem, the coefficient in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the sum of coefficients in the other part is 64, so 6*64=384. Let me check another example to be sure.\n\nTake \\((a + b)^1 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). The expansion is (a + b)(c + 1/c) = ac + a/c + bc + b/c. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is zero, which again matches my approach because in \\((a + b)^1\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is zero, so 0 * 2 = 0.\n\nBut let me take a case where the coefficient isn't zero. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^3 \\times (c + 1/c)^2\\). The expansion of \\((a + b)^3\\) is \\(a^3 + 3a^2b + 3ab^2 + b^3\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is zero. Wait, that's not helpful. Let me pick a different example where the term exists.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think again. The problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of the powers of c. So, each term in the product will be of the form (term from (a + b)^4) * (term from (c + 1/c)^6). The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the \\(6a^2b^2\\) term in \\((a + b)^4\\), and when multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), it will produce terms like \\(6a^2b^2c^k\\) where k varies. But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the c terms, we need to sum all the coefficients from each multiplication by the c terms.\n\nWait, but that's not quite right. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would actually be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because each term in the c expansion contributes a factor that, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), gives a term with \\(a^2b^2\\) and some c terms. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would be the sum of all the coefficients from each of these products. Wait, no, that's not correct. Because when you multiply \\(6a^2b^2\\) by, say, \\(c^6\\), you get \\(6a^2b^2c^6\\), which has a coefficient of 6 for \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), but the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) alone, without considering c, would just be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the c expansion, because each term in the c expansion contributes a multiple of \\(a^2b^2\\).\n\nWait, perhaps I'm conflating the terms. Let me think again. The entire expression is a product of two polynomials: one in a and b, and one in c and 1/c. So, when you multiply them, each term in the a and b polynomial is multiplied by each term in the c and 1/c polynomial. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the a and b part will be multiplied by each term from the c part, which has coefficients. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the a and b part (which is 6) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the c part. Because each term in the c part is a coefficient times a power of c, so when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), it gives a term with coefficient 6 times that coefficient, and the sum of all those would be 6 times the sum of coefficients in the c part.\n\nTherefore, the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by setting c = 1, as I did earlier, which gives 2^6 = 64. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me verify this with a smaller exponent to see if this approach holds. Let's take \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). The expansion of \\((a + b)^2\\) is \\(a^2 + 2ab + b^2\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 0. The sum of coefficients in \\((c + 1/c)^1\\) is 2. So, according to my approach, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 0 * 2 = 0, which is correct because the product doesn't have any \\(a^2b^2\\) terms.\n\nAnother example: \\((a + b)^3 \\times (c + 1/c)^2\\). The expansion of \\((a + b)^3\\) is \\(a^3 + 3a^2b + 3ab^2 + b^3\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 0. The sum of coefficients in \\((c + 1/c)^2\\) is 3. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 0 * 3 = 0, which is correct.\n\nWait, but let's take a case where the coefficient isn't zero. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^4 \\times (c + 1/c)^0\\). Then, the expression is just \\((a + b)^4\\), and the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, which matches 6 * 1 (since \\((c + 1/c)^0 = 1\\)).\n\nSo, it seems my approach is correct. Therefore, in the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not missing something. The problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which in the product would be 6 times the sum of coefficients in the c part. Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficients multiply for each term. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) in the product is the product of the coefficients of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial and \\(c^k\\) in the second. But the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the c terms. So, that would be the sum over all k of (coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in first poly) * (coefficient of \\(c^k\\) in second poly). But since the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first poly is 6, and the sum of coefficients in the second poly is 64, then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So, I think I'm confident that the coefficient is 384.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{384}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem for both parts of the expression.\n\nFirst, we expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\binom{4}{0}a^4 + \\binom{4}{1}a^3b + \\binom{4}{2}a^2b^2 + \\binom{4}{3}ab^3 + \\binom{4}{4}b^4\n\\]\nCalculating the binomial coefficients, we get:\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\n\\]\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in this expansion is 6.\n\nNext, we consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The sum of the coefficients in this expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\):\n\\[\n\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\n\\]\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Therefore, we multiply 6 by 64:\n\\[\n6 \\times 64 = 384\n\\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{384}."

    "text": " Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I remember that when expanding expressions like \\((a + b)^n\\), we can use the binomial theorem. The binomial theorem states that \\((a + b)^n = \\sum_{k=0}^{n} \\dbinom{n}{k} a^{n - k}b^{k}\\). So, maybe I can apply this theorem to both parts of the given expression: \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nBut wait, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). That term is specifically in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\), right? So, maybe I don't need to worry about the \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) part when looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Because \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), so their coefficients are independent of the \\(c\\) terms.\n\nLet me confirm that. The expression is a product of two separate binomials: one involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the other involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, when we multiply them out, each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). However, since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), we can focus on that part and ignore the \\(c\\) terms because they won't affect the power of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\).\n\nSo, let's first find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\). Using the binomial theorem, the general term is \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^{k}\\). We want the term where \\(a^2b^2\\), so let's set up the exponents:\n\n\\(4 - k = 2\\) for \\(a\\), which gives \\(k = 2\\).\n\nSo, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\).\n\nCalculating that, \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\).\n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\nNow, since we're multiplying this by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the entire expression becomes a product of two expansions. However, as I thought earlier, the \\(c\\) terms won't affect the powers of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression will just be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all terms from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nWait, no. Actually, when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. So, if we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), it would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Because any term from the second part, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), would still result in a term that includes \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by some \\(c\\) terms.\n\nBut the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). Wait, no, that's not correct. Let me think again.\n\nActually, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression. So, when you expand \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), you'll get terms like \\(a^2b^2 \\times c^k\\) for various \\(k\\). But the question is about the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would include all the coefficients from the \\(c\\) terms because each term in the expansion would be \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by some coefficient times \\(c^k\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would actually be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part, summed over all possible terms.\n\nWait, no, that's not quite right. Because when you multiply two expressions, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is a coefficient times a power of \\(c\\), and when you multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), you're effectively scaling \\(a^2b^2\\) by each of those coefficients, so the total coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the original coefficient times the sum of all coefficients in the second expression.\n\nBut wait, the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), because that makes each term equal to its coefficient. So, substituting \\(c = 1\\), we get \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\).\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 (from \\((a + b)^4\\)) multiplied by 64 (the sum of coefficients from the second part), which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but that doesn't seem right. Because when you multiply two expressions, the coefficient of a specific term in the first expression is multiplied by the entire second expression. So, if you're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), it's actually the coefficient from the first part times the entire second expansion. But that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion, which would make it a polynomial, not a single coefficient. That can't be right.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me think again. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. So, when you expand the product, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second part, each of which has a coefficient. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part.\n\nWait, but that would be if we were looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). But in reality, each term in the product will have both \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms and \\(c\\) terms. So, if we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, then it's correct that we need to multiply the coefficient from the first part by the sum of all coefficients in the second part.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem had specified a particular power of \\(c\\), say \\(c^0\\), then we would have to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would involve multiplying the coefficient from the first part by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part. But since the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), without specifying any \\(c\\) terms, it's considering all possible powers of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient would indeed be the product of the two coefficients: 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expression.\n\nSo, as I calculated earlier, the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me double-check that. Alternatively, maybe the problem is considering only the terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) appears without any \\(c\\) terms, but that doesn't make much sense because \\(c\\) and \\(a, b\\) are separate variables. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by various powers of \\(c\\), but the coefficient would include all those contributions. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would indeed be the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all coefficients from the second part.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think differently. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, which is a product of two separate expansions. So, when you multiply them, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, each of which has a coefficient. Therefore, the total coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) across all possible \\(c\\) terms is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me confirm this by another approach. Let's consider that the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When expanded, this will be a sum of terms of the form \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}a^{4 - k}b^{k} \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - m}\\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\), which simplifies to \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}\\dbinom{6}{m} a^{4 - k}b^{k}c^{6 - 2m}\\).\n\nNow, we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so we need \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). So, for \\(a^2b^2\\), \\(k = 2\\). Now, the term will be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\dbinom{6}{m} a^2b^2c^{6 - 2m}\\).\n\nBut the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would include all possible coefficients from the \\(c\\) terms. So, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} \\times \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m}\\).\n\nWait, but \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\nYes, that confirms my earlier result. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is 384.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\). That would be a different calculation. Let me check the problem statement again.\n\nThe problem says: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" It doesn't specify any particular power of \\(c\\), so I think it's just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. Therefore, as I thought earlier, it's 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem had asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then we would need to find the coefficient where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\), which would involve finding the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion and then multiplying by 6.\n\nSo, to clarify, if we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) irrespective of the \\(c\\) terms, then it's 384. But if we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), that would be a different calculation.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, in that case, the answer would be 384.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating, and the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, which would include all possible powers of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient is indeed 384.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Let's consider that when you expand \\((a + b)^4\\), you get terms up to \\(a^4\\) and \\(b^4\\). Similarly, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) will expand to terms involving \\(c^6\\), \\(c^4\\), \\(c^2\\), \\(c^0\\), \\(c^{-2}\\), \\(c^{-4}\\), \\(c^{-6}\\). So, when you multiply them, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second, so the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be present in the product multiplied by each of these \\(c\\) terms. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the sum of all these contributions, which is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So, the coefficient is 384.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me compute the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The sum of coefficients is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), so \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\), as I thought earlier.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nI think that's the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{384}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break down the problem using the binomial theorem.\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^{k}\n   \\]\n   We need the term where \\(a^2b^2\\), which occurs when \\(k = 2\\):\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} a^{2}b^{2} = 6 a^{2}b^{2}\n   \\]\n   So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\n2. **Consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   The sum of all coefficients in this expansion can be found by setting \\(c = 1\\):\n   \\[\n   \\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\n   \\]\n\n3. **Combine the results:**\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) and the sum of all coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 64 = 384\n   \\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\boxed{384}\\)."

Let me try to approach this step by step.\n\nFirst, I can consider the expression as a product of two separate expansions: one involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the other involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).

So, when you expand this, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is a combination of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is a combination of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, when you multiply them together, each term will be something like \\(a^kb^{4 - k} \\times c^m (1/c)^{6 - m}\\), which simplifies to \\(a^kb^{4 - k} c^{m - (6 - m)}\\) = \\(a^kb^{4 - k} c^{2m - 6}\\).\n\nBut the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, in the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is present, and its coefficient is, let's compute that first.\n\nIn \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is given by the binomial coefficient \\(\\binom{4}{2}\\), which is 6. So, the term is \\(6a^2b^2\\).\n\nNow, when we multiply this by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) will be multiplied by \\(6a^2b^2\\). So, the product will have terms like \\(6a^2b^2 \\times \\text{term from } \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\).\n\nBut the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would be the sum of all the coefficients from the \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) expansion multiplied by 6. Wait, that can't be right because each term in the product would have both \\(a^2b^2\\) and some power of \\(c\\). So, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), meaning that we need to collect all the terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present, each multiplied by some power of \\(c\\), and then sum their coefficients.\n\nBut that would mean the coefficient is \\(6 \\times\\) the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that doesn't seem right because the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) would be when \\(c = 1\\), which is \\(2^6 = 64\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). But I'm not sure if that's what the problem is asking. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times some specific power of \\(c\\), but it's not specified.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Let me read the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\).\" So, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable, so the coefficient would be \\(6 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't seem right because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only considering the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) parts and not the \\(c\\) parts, so the coefficient would just be 6. But that seems too simple.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\), i.e., the constant term with respect to \\(c\\). That makes more sense because otherwise, the coefficient would be a function of \\(c\\), which isn't typically what such problems ask for.\n\nSo, if that's the case, then I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, first, compute the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, as I found earlier. Then, compute the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\).\n\nTo compute the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), I can use the binomial theorem. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is the sum from \\(k = 0\\) to \\(6\\) of \\(\\binom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\times (1/c)^k\\), which simplifies to \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\binom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\).\n\nWe want the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which implies \\(k = 3\\). So, the coefficient is \\(\\binom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire product is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nWait, but let me confirm. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\) with coefficient 6, and the term \\(c^0\\) comes from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) with coefficient 20. So, when multiplied together, the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\) is 120. Therefore, the answer should be 120.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in calculating the binomial coefficients. For \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed \\(\\binom{4}{2} = 6\\). For \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\binom{6}{3} = 20\\), since we need the term where \\(k = 3\\), which gives \\(c^{6 - 2*3} = c^0\\). So, 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nI think that's correct. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is \\(\\binom{4}{2} = 6\\). Next, we find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which occurs when \\(k = 3\\), giving \\(\\binom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying these coefficients together, we get \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\boxed{120}"

    "text": " Wait, but actually, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but the expression also has terms with \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). Hmm, maybe I need to clarify. Since the question is about \\(a^2b^2\\), perhaps the terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) don't affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so maybe I can treat them separately.\n\nLet me think. The expression is a product of two parts: \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Since multiplication distributes over addition, the entire expansion will be a sum of terms where each term is a product of a term from the first expansion and a term from the second expansion. But the question is only asking about the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, in the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will have a certain coefficient, and in the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term will contribute a coefficient as well. However, since the variables in the second part are \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), which are different from \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire second part. Wait, is that right?\n\nWait, no. Because when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficients multiply only if the variables match. But in this case, the second part doesn't have \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), so when you multiply, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part will be multiplied by every term in the second part. But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is only in the first part, and the second part has different variables, perhaps the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't seem right because when you multiply, each term from the first polynomial is multiplied by each term from the second, but the variables are separate. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, no, that's not correct either because the sum of all coefficients would be when you set \\(c = 1\\), but that's not necessary here.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try to approach it differently. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when you expand this, each term in the expansion will be of the form \\(\\binom{4}{k}a^{k}b^{4 - k}\\) multiplied by \\(\\binom{6}{m}c^{m}\\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^{6 - m}\\), which simplifies to \\(\\binom{4}{k}a^{k}b^{4 - k} \\times \\binom{6}{m}c^{m - (6 - m)} = \\binom{4}{k}a^{k}b^{4 - k} \\times \\binom{6}{m}c^{2m - 6}\\).\n\nSo, each term is \\(\\binom{4}{k}\\binom{6}{m} a^{k}b^{4 - k} c^{2m - 6}\\). Now, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, in the term \\(a^{k}b^{4 - k}\\), we need \\(k = 2\\) and \\(4 - k = 2\\), so \\(k = 2\\). So, the coefficient from the first part is \\(\\binom{4}{2}\\).\n\nNow, since the variables \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part will be multiplied by every term in the second part. But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so the coefficient will be \\(\\binom{4}{2}\\) times the sum of all coefficients in the second part \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, no, that's not correct because each term in the second part has different powers of \\(c\\), but since the problem is only concerned with the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product will be \\(\\binom{4}{2}\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial. Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second polynomial, each term contributes a coefficient, and since all those terms are being added together, the total coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) times each term in the second polynomial will be the sum of the coefficients in the second polynomial multiplied by \\(\\binom{4}{2}\\).\n\nWait, but actually, when you have a product of two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial, but since the second polynomial doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial multiplied by the entire second polynomial. But that's not quite right because the second polynomial is a separate variable. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial, because each term in the second polynomial contributes a coefficient when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\).\n\nBut wait, no. Let me think again. The product is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when you expand this, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, for the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which has a coefficient of \\(\\binom{4}{2}\\), it will be multiplied by every term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product will be \\(\\binom{4}{2}\\) times the sum of the coefficients of all terms in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nBut wait, the sum of the coefficients in a polynomial is found by setting all variables to 1. So, if I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) becomes \\((1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of the coefficients in the second polynomial is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is \\(\\binom{4}{2} \\times 64\\).\n\nWait, but that seems a bit high. Let me check. Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that each term in the product is a combination of terms from both polynomials, but since the variables are separate, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just the coefficient from the first polynomial times the entire second polynomial. But that would mean the coefficient is \\(\\binom{4}{2} \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial, not a single coefficient. So, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, in other words, in the entire expansion, how many times does \\(a^2b^2\\) appear, and each time it's multiplied by some power of \\(c\\), but the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would be the sum of all coefficients from the second polynomial multiplied by \\(\\binom{4}{2}\\).\n\nWait, but that would mean the coefficient is \\(\\binom{4}{2} \\times \\text{sum of coefficients in the second polynomial}\\), which is \\(\\binom{4}{2} \\times 64 = 6 \\times 64 = 384\\). But I'm not sure if that's correct because the problem might be asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, but without considering the \\(c\\) terms. Alternatively, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which would mean that the coefficient is \\(\\binom{4}{2} \\times \\left(\\text{sum of coefficients in the second polynomial}\\right)\\), which is 6 \u00d7 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me think again. When you have two polynomials multiplied together, the coefficient of a specific term in one polynomial is multiplied by the entire other polynomial. So, if I have \\(P(a, b) \\times Q(c)\\), then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(P(a, b)\\) times \\(Q(c)\\). So, in this case, \\(Q(c)\\) is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial in \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is \\(\\binom{4}{2} \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that's a polynomial in \\(c\\), not a single coefficient. So, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, treating it as a polynomial in \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\), and \\(1/c\\). But the problem didn't specify anything about \\(c\\), so maybe it's just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which would mean that the coefficient is \\(\\binom{4}{2} \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems odd because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, not an expression involving \\(c\\).\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which would mean that the coefficient is \\(\\binom{4}{2} \\times \\text{sum of coefficients in the second polynomial}\\), which is 6 \u00d7 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me check another approach. Let's compute the expansion step by step.\n\nFirst, expand \\((a + b)^4\\). The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from choosing 2 \\(a\\)s and 2 \\(b\\)s. The coefficient is \\(\\binom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n\nNext, expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The expansion is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\binom{6}{k} c^{k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^{6 - k} = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\binom{6}{k} c^{2k - 6}\\).\n\nSo, the expansion is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\binom{6}{k} c^{2k - 6}\\).\n\nNow, when we multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, which are \\(\\binom{6}{k} c^{2k - 6}\\) for \\(k = 0\\) to \\(6\\).\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is \\(6 \\times \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\binom{6}{k}\\), because each term in the second expansion contributes its coefficient when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\).\n\nWait, but \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\binom{6}{k} = 2^6 = 64\\), as before. So, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\nWait, but let me make sure. Is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product equal to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial times the sum of the coefficients in the second polynomial? That seems to make sense because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second polynomial, each term contributes its coefficient to the product, so the total coefficient is the product of the two coefficients.\n\nAlternatively, if I think of it as a product of two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in one polynomial is multiplied by the entire other polynomial, but since we're only interested in the coefficient of that specific term, regardless of the other variables, it's the product of the coefficients.\n\nWait, but in this case, the other polynomial doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), so when you multiply, each term in the second polynomial just scales the term \\(a^2b^2\\) by its coefficient. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is indeed the coefficient from the first polynomial times the sum of the coefficients in the second polynomial.\n\nSo, that would be \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\nWait, but let me check if that's correct by considering a simpler case. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). The coefficient of \\(a^1b^1\\) in \\((a + b)^2\\) is 2. The sum of coefficients in \\((c + 1/c)\\) is \\(1 + 1 = 2\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^1b^1\\) in the product would be \\(2 \\times 2 = 4\\). Let's see if that's correct.\n\nExpanding \\((a + b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2\\). Expanding \\((c + 1/c) = c + 1/c\\). Multiplying them: \\(a^2(c + 1/c) + 2ab(c + 1/c) + b^2(c + 1/c)\\). So, the term \\(ab\\) comes from \\(2ab \\times c\\) and \\(2ab \\times 1/c\\), so the coefficient of \\(ab\\) is \\(2c + 2(1/c)\\). Wait, but that's not a numerical coefficient; it's still involving \\(c\\). So, perhaps my earlier approach is incorrect.\n\nWait, so in this simpler case, the coefficient of \\(ab\\) is \\(2c + 2/c\\), which is not a single number, but a combination of terms. So, maybe in the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(6 \\times (c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15/c^2 + 6/c^4 + 1/c^6)\\). So, the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), not a single number. Therefore, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), which would mean that the coefficient is the sum of all the coefficients from the second polynomial multiplied by 6, which would be 6 \u00d7 64 = 384. But in the simpler case, the coefficient of \\(ab\\) would be 2 \u00d7 2 = 4, but in reality, it's \\(2c + 2/c\\), whose coefficients sum to 4 when \\(c = 1\\). So, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient when considering all possible powers of \\(c\\), but as a single coefficient, which would require summing the coefficients from the second polynomial.\n\nWait, but in the original problem, the question is: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\" in the product. So, in the product, \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term from the second polynomial, which has different powers of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is not a single number but a polynomial in \\(c\\). Therefore, perhaps the problem is miswritten or I'm misunderstanding it.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where the exponents of \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are 2, 2, and 0, respectively. But the problem doesn't specify anything about \\(c\\), so that might not be the case.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), treating \\(c\\) as another variable, so the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem asks for a numerical coefficient, so perhaps it's expecting a number, which would mean that the coefficient is the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial multiplied by the coefficient from the first polynomial.\n\nWait, but in the simpler case, when I set \\(c = 1\\), the coefficient of \\(ab\\) becomes \\(2 \\times (1 + 1) = 4\\), which is correct because when \\(c = 1\\), the product becomes \\((a + b)^2 \\times (1 + 1) = 2(a + b)^2\\), so the coefficient of \\(ab\\) is \\(2 \\times 2 = 4\\). So, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when \\(c = 1\\), which would be the sum of coefficients in the second polynomial times the coefficient from the first polynomial.\n\nTherefore, in the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be \\(\\binom{4}{2} \\times 2^6 = 6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\nWait, but I'm not entirely sure if this is the correct interpretation. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which would mean that the coefficient is the sum over all possible \\(c\\) terms, so it's indeed 384.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting me to consider that the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is only multiplied by the constant term in the second polynomial. But that doesn't make sense because the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\binom{6}{3} = 20\\), so the coefficient would be \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). But that contradicts my earlier reasoning.\n\nWait, let me check the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). The general term is \\(\\binom{6}{k}c^{k} \\times (1/c)^{6 - k} = \\binom{6}{k}c^{2k - 6}\\). So, the exponents of \\(c\\) are \\( -6, -4, -2, 0, 2, 4, 6\\) for \\(k = 0\\) to \\(6\\). So, the constant term is when \\(2k - 6 = 0\\), which is when \\(k = 3\\), so the constant term is \\(\\binom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n\nSo, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), then the coefficient would be \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). But the problem didn't specify anything about \\(c\\), so perhaps it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), which would be the sum over all coefficients from the second polynomial times 6, which is 384.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, without considering \\(c\\), which would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the entire second polynomial, but that seems unlikely.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider that the problem is written as \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), and it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but not specifying any \\(c\\) terms, so perhaps the answer is simply the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, and the second part is irrelevant. But that can't be right because the entire expression is a product, so the coefficient would be affected by the second part.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try to think differently. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. The product is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, when you expand this product, each term will be a product of a term from the first expansion and a term from the second expansion. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first expansion, and it's multiplied by every term in the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 \u00d7 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem is only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, then it's 384. But if it's interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), then it's 120.\n\nWait, perhaps I should check the problem statement again. It says: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), without any mention of \\(c\\). Therefore, perhaps the answer is 384, as that's the coefficient when considering all possible powers of \\(c\\). Alternatively, maybe the problem is expecting me to treat \\(c\\) as a separate variable and consider that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is a polynomial in \\(c\\), but the problem asks for a numerical coefficient, so perhaps 384 is the correct answer.\n\nWait, but in the simpler case I considered earlier, when I set \\(c = 1\\), the coefficient of \\(ab\\) became 4, which is the same as 2 \u00d7 2, where 2 is the coefficient from the first polynomial and 2 is the sum of coefficients from the second polynomial. So, perhaps in the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 \u00d7 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, so the answer is 384.\n\nWait, but let me think again. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) is in the first part, and the second part is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is a separate polynomial. So, when you multiply, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient from the first part times the entire second polynomial. But that would make the coefficient a polynomial, not a number. Therefore, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by the constant term in the second polynomial.\n\nIn that case, the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\binom{6}{3} = 20\\), so the coefficient would be \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nBut the problem didn't specify the power of \\(c\\), so perhaps it's expecting the coefficient regardless of \\(c\\), which would be 384.\n\nWait, perhaps I should look for similar problems or think about how such coefficients are treated. Typically, when a problem asks for the coefficient of a term in a product of polynomials, it's considering the term in the combined variables. So, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, then it's the sum over all possible \\(c\\) terms multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). So, that would be the coefficient from the first polynomial times the sum of coefficients from the second polynomial, which is 6 \u00d7 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting me to recognize that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, and the second polynomial is separate, so the answer is 6. But that seems incorrect because the product involves both polynomials.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and the second part is irrelevant. But that seems unlikely because the problem includes both parts.\n\nWait, let me think again. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). When you expand this, each term is a product of a term from each polynomial. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first polynomial is multiplied by each term from the second polynomial, which includes various powers of \\(c\\). So, in the entire product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each of those terms, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), etc. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is not a single number but a polynomial in \\(c\\). Therefore, perhaps the problem is miswritten, or I'm misunderstanding it.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, so the coefficient is a polynomial. But the problem asks for a numerical coefficient, so perhaps it's expecting the sum of all coefficients when considering \\(a^2b^2\\) times each term in the second polynomial, which would be 6 \u00d7 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting me to consider that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, and the second polynomial is separate, so the answer is 6. But that seems incorrect because the product would involve both polynomials.\n\nWait, perhaps I should look for an example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). The expansion is \\((a^2 + 2ab + b^2)(c + 1/c)\\). So, the term \\(ab\\) is present in \\(2ab \\times c\\) and \\(2ab \\times 1/c\\), so the coefficient of \\(ab\\) in the product is \\(2c + 2/c\\). So, the coefficient is a polynomial, not a single number. Therefore, in the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be a polynomial in \\(c\\), not a single number. So, perhaps the problem is expecting me to write it as a polynomial, but the problem asks for a coefficient, which is usually a number. Therefore, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient when \\(c = 1\\), which would make the second polynomial equal to \\(2^6 = 64\\), so the coefficient would be \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial, which is 6, and the second part is irrelevant, but that seems unlikely.\n\nWait, perhaps I should check the problem again. It says: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\).\" So, perhaps the answer is 6 times the sum of coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 6 \u00d7 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting me to recognize that the coefficient is 6, and the second polynomial doesn't affect it, but that seems incorrect because the product involves both polynomials.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the same as the coefficient in the first polynomial because the second polynomial doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\). But that can't be right because when you multiply by the second polynomial, each term is scaled by its coefficients.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, so it's 6 times the sum of coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 384.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting me to compute the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating \\(c\\) as a variable, so the coefficient is a polynomial, but the problem asks for a numerical coefficient, so perhaps it's 384.\n\nWait, I think I've spent enough time thinking through this. I'll conclude that the coefficient is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is \\(\\binom{4}{2} = 6\\). The sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\(2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\boxed{384}."

Hmm, maybe I need to clarify whether the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is part of the entire expansion, which includes the \\(c\\) terms as well. Or perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. Let me think.\n\nWait, the problem says: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a+b)^4\\left(c+\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, maybe it's considering the entire expansion, which includes both \\(a, b\\) and \\(c, 1/c\\). But \\(a^2b^2\\) is only part of the \\((a + b)^4\\) term, right? So, does that mean I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), and then multiply it by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), or is it something else?\n\nWait, no, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, which would include terms from both expansions. But \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term that comes from \\((a + b)^4\\), and when you multiply by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the \\(c\\) terms would just be multiplied by the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. So, perhaps the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually remain the same as in \\((a + b)^4\\), because when you multiply by the other expression, it's just scaling the entire term by some factor, but the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the same as in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of the coefficients of all terms in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that might not be correct because each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) has a different power of \\(c\\), but the \\(a^2b^2\\) term is independent of \\(c\\), so perhaps when you multiply, each term in the product will have \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by each term in the \\(c\\) expansion. But then, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that doesn't make sense because the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) would be found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\(2^6 = 64\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 * 64 = 384? Wait, no, that can't be right because the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and if I multiply by 64, then it's 6 * 64 = 384. But let me check if that's correct.\n\nWait, no, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Let me approach it step by step.\n\nFirst, I know that \\((a + b)^4\\) can be expanded using the binomial theorem. The general term in the expansion is \\(\\binom{4}{k} a^{4 - k} b^{k}\\), where \\(k\\) ranges from 0 to 4.\n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is \\(\\binom{4}{2}\\), which is 6. So, that part is straightforward.\n\nNow, the other part of the expression is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me expand that as well using the binomial theorem. The general term here is \\(\\binom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\binom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\).\n\nSo, the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is the sum from \\(m = 0\\) to \\(6\\) of \\(\\binom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\).\n\nNow, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, which are terms involving \\(c^{6 - 2m}\\).\n\nSo, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion will appear in the product as \\(6 \\times a^2b^2 \\times \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\binom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\).\n\nBut the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which I think refers to the coefficient when considering only the \\(a^2b^2\\) term, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. But that might not make sense because the product includes \\(c\\) terms, so perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by any power of \\(c\\). But that's not possible because \\(a^2b^2\\) is a separate term from \\(c\\). Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when considering the entire expansion, which would be the sum of all coefficients from the \\(c\\) terms multiplied by the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part.\n\nWait, but that would mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but that seems high. Let me check again. Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but in the entire product, each term is of the form \\(a^2b^2c^{k}\\) for some exponent \\(k\\). But perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without considering the \\(c\\) terms, which would just be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of coefficients from the other expansion. So, that would be 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, meaning that each term is considered as a product, so the coefficient would be the sum of all products where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any term from the other expansion. So, that would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the other expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. So, perhaps the answer is 384.\n\nWait, but let me think again. When you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum of the products of the coefficients of terms that multiply together to give that specific term. So, in this case, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from \\((a + b)^4\\), and when multiplied by any term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), it will produce terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) where \\(k\\) is any integer. But if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), perhaps it's considering all possible powers of \\(c\\), so the coefficient would be the sum over all \\(c^k\\) terms multiplied by the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6. So, that would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but I'm not sure if that's correct because the problem is phrased as \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", which might imply considering \\(a^2b^2\\) as a standalone term, but in reality, in the product, \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term from the other expansion, so each of those products would have different powers of \\(c\\). So, perhaps the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is actually 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), meaning that the coefficient is 6 times each term in that expansion. But that would mean that the coefficient isn't a single number but a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem asks for the coefficient, which is a number, so perhaps it's expecting a numerical coefficient, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which would require considering only the terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by the constant term (i.e., where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out). But that seems more complicated, and the problem doesn't specify any condition on \\(c\\). So, perhaps the initial approach is correct: the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the sum of coefficients in the other expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me verify this with a simpler example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, expanding, we have \\((a^2 + 2ab + b^2) \\times (c + 1/c)\\). The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be zero because in the first expansion, the highest power is \\(a^2b^0\\) and \\(ab^1\\), so when multiplied by \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), you can't get \\(a^2b^2\\). So, in this case, the coefficient is zero, which contradicts the earlier approach because the sum of coefficients in \\((c + 1/c)^1\\) is 2, and 2 times the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^2\\), which is 1, would give 2, but the actual coefficient is zero because you can't get \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. So, that suggests that my initial approach was wrong.\n\nSo, perhaps I need to approach this differently. Let's think again: when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum of the products of coefficients of terms that multiply to give that specific term. So, in our problem, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) can only come from the first polynomial, \\((a + b)^4\\), because the second polynomial, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), doesn't have any \\(a\\) or \\(b\\) terms. So, when you multiply, the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) is to take the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first polynomial and multiply it by any term from the second polynomial. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial. Because each term in the second polynomial is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), so the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of coefficients in the second polynomial.\n\nBut wait, in the earlier example, \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be zero, as we saw, but according to this approach, it would be 1 (coefficient of \\(a^2\\) in the first polynomial) times the sum of coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 2, giving 2. But that's incorrect because in reality, you can't get \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. So, perhaps this approach is wrong.\n\nWait, perhaps the confusion arises because in the problem, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is part of the first polynomial, and the second polynomial doesn't contain \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), so when you multiply, the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) is to take \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first polynomial and multiply it by any term from the second polynomial, which would result in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, considering all possible \\(c\\) terms, would be 6 times the entire expansion of the second polynomial. But if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), then it's not possible because \\(a^2b^2\\) is always multiplied by some power of \\(c\\). So, perhaps the problem is misstated, or perhaps I'm misunderstanding it.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\), which is 1. So, in that case, we need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\) in the product. That would make more sense.\n\nSo, to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), we need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial, which is 6, and then find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second polynomial, which is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nSo, let's compute the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem, the general term is \\(\\binom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be zero, so:\n\n\\(6 - 2m = 0\\)\n\nSolving for \\(m\\):\n\n\\(2m = 6\\)\n\n\\(m = 3\\)\n\nSo, the coefficient is \\(\\binom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second polynomial is 20.\n\nNow, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product is the product of the coefficients from each polynomial, which is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nSo, the answer should be 120.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought the answer might be 384, but that was under a different interpretation. Now, considering that the problem might be asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120, that seems more plausible.\n\nWait, let me confirm. The problem says: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, it's not specifying any \\(c\\) terms, which is confusing. But in the context of polynomials, when you have multiple variables, the coefficient of a specific term is the coefficient when all other variables are considered as part of the term. So, if the term is \\(a^2b^2\\), it's possible that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), which would mean summing over all possible \\(c\\) terms. But that approach led to a contradiction in the earlier example.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is a specific term. But the problem didn't specify the \\(c\\) term, so it's ambiguous.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is miswritten, and it's supposed to be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), but without that, it's unclear. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, considering that the \\(c\\) terms are separate, so the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nBut in the earlier example, that approach didn't work because it gave a wrong result, so perhaps that approach is incorrect.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, considering that \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any term from the second polynomial, so the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of the second polynomial, but that would make the coefficient a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the problem asks for a numerical coefficient.\n\nSo, perhaps the correct interpretation is that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nWait, but in that case, the problem should have specified \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), not just \\(a^2b^2\\). So, perhaps the problem is miswritten, but given that, I think the intended answer is 120.\n\nWait, let me think again. When you have the product of two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term is the sum of the products of the coefficients of terms that multiply to give that specific term. So, in our case, to get \\(a^2b^2\\), we need to take \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first polynomial and multiply it by any term from the second polynomial. So, each such product will have \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by \\(c^k\\) for some \\(k\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is actually the coefficient from the first polynomial times the entire second polynomial. But that would mean the coefficient isn't a single number but a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the problem asks for a numerical coefficient.\n\nTherefore, perhaps the problem is intended to ask for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120, as calculated earlier.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, considering only the terms where \\(c\\) is present, but that doesn't make much sense.\n\nWait, perhaps I should look at the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, it's possible that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, considering all possible powers of \\(c\\). But in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nBut as I saw in the earlier example, this approach doesn't hold because in \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be zero, but according to this approach, it would be 1 * 2 = 2, which is incorrect. So, perhaps that approach is wrong.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Let me try a different approach. Since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, it's possible that it's just the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial, because each term in the second polynomial is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), so the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) across all \\(c\\) terms would be 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nBut in the example, that approach didn't work, so perhaps the problem is expecting the answer 384. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nWait, perhaps I should compute both and see which one makes sense.\n\nFirst, coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\): 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nSecond, coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\): 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWhich one is correct? Let me check with the example.\n\nIn \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\) would be 1 * 2 = 2, but in reality, there is no \\(a^2b^2\\) term because you can't get \\(a^2b^2\\) from \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)\\), since \\((a + b)^2\\) only has \\(a^2, ab, b^2\\), and multiplying by \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\) doesn't change the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is zero, which contradicts the approach of 1 * 2 = 2.\n\nTherefore, the approach of multiplying the coefficient from the first polynomial by the sum of coefficients from the second polynomial is incorrect.\n\nThus, the correct approach must be that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is zero, because you can't get \\(a^2b^2\\) from the product of \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)\\). Therefore, the initial approach was wrong, and the correct approach is that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second polynomial, which would be 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but in the example, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) would be zero because \\((a + b)^2\\) doesn't have \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, no, \\((a + b)^2\\) has \\(a^2, 2ab, b^2\\). So, there is no \\(a^2b^2\\) term in \\((a + b)^2\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) would indeed be zero. So, in that case, the approach of 6 * 20 = 120 would be correct for the original problem, because \\((a + b)^4\\) does have an \\(a^2b^2\\) term.\n\nWait, so in the original problem, \\((a + b)^4\\) has \\(a^2b^2\\) with coefficient 6, and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) has \\(c^0\\) term with coefficient 20, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nTherefore, I think the correct answer is 120.\n\nWait, but let me confirm once more. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). So, perhaps the problem is considering \\(a^2b^2\\) as a separate term, but in the product, \\(a^2b^2\\) is always multiplied by some power of \\(c\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would actually be a polynomial in \\(c\\), which isn't a single number. Therefore, perhaps the problem is miswritten, and the intended term was \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), in which case the answer is 120.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, considering all possible \\(c\\) terms, which would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 6 * 64 = 384. But in the example, that approach didn't work, so I'm unsure.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is expecting the answer 120, as that's the coefficient when considering only the constant term in \\(c\\), which is a common type of problem. So, perhaps the answer is 120.\n\nWait, let me compute both possibilities.\n\nFirst, coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\): 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nSecond, coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\): 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nGiven that, and considering that in the example, the first approach didn't work, I think the correct answer is 120.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, considering the constant term in \\(c\\), is 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break down the problem into two parts: the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) and the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\n1. **Expanding \\((a + b)^4\\):**\n   Using the binomial theorem, the general term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is given by:\n   \\[\n   \\binom{4}{k} a^{4 - k} b^k\n   \\]\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is found when \\(k = 2\\):\n   \\[\n   \\binom{4}{2} = 6\n   \\]\n\n2. **Expanding \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   Using the binomial theorem, the general term in the expansion is:\n   \\[\n   \\binom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n   \\]\n   We need the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) (the constant term), which occurs when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\).

    "text": " Hmm, okay, let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that when you have an expression raised to a power like \\((a + b)^n\\), you can expand it using the binomial theorem. The binomial theorem says that \\((a + b)^n = \\sum_{k=0}^{n} \\dbinom{n}{k} a^{n-k} b^k\\). So, in this case, for \\((a + b)^4\\), I can write it as the sum from k=0 to 4 of \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k} b^k\\).\n\nWait, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, I need to find the term in the expansion where \\(a\\) is squared and \\(b\\) is squared. That would correspond to \\(a^{2}b^{2}\\), so let me see what k would be here. Since in the binomial expansion, the exponent of \\(a\\) is \\(4 - k\\) and the exponent of \\(b\\) is \\(k\\). So, if I set \\(4 - k = 2\\), then \\(k = 2\\). So, the term we're interested in is when k=2.\n\nSo, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Let me compute that. \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient is 6.\n\nWait, but the original problem is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I think I only need the coefficient from the first part because the second part is multiplied by it, but maybe I'm misunderstanding. Wait, no, actually, the entire expression is the product of these two expansions. So, to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I think I only need to consider the coefficient from the first part because the second part doesn't affect \\(a\\) or \\(b\\). Hmm, let me think again.\n\nWait, no, actually, the second part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which only involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), so when I multiply the two expressions together, the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) will come from the first part, and the terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) will come from the second part. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part, but since the second part doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), it's just a scalar multiplier. Wait, no, that's not right because when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the sum of all terms in the second part, but that doesn't make sense because the second part is separate.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of what happens with \\(c\\). But that can't be because the product is \\((a + b)^4 \\times (c + 1/c)^6\\), so each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\((c + 1/c)^6\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so that would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the entire expansion of the second part, but that would mean the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second part. But that can't be, because the second part's expansion is a separate variable.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, perhaps the problem is considering only the terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) appears, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. But in that case, the coefficient would just be the coefficient from the first part, because the second part doesn't affect \\(a\\) or \\(b\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6, and the second part is just a separate polynomial that's multiplied by it, but since the problem is only asking about \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), maybe the answer is just 6. But that seems too simple, so perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) or something like that, but it's not specified. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps I'm supposed to consider the entire product and find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by some power of \\(c\\), but the problem doesn't specify, so maybe I'm overcomplicating.\n\nWait, no, perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, so it's just 6 times whatever the coefficient is for the constant term in the second part. Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by terms from the second part, you'd have \\(a^2b^2 \\times\\) some terms involving \\(c\\), but if you're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), perhaps you're only considering the term where the \\(c\\) parts cancel out to 1, i.e., \\(c^0\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nAh, that makes sense. So, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, which would involve considering the terms where \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) multiply to give a constant term, so that the resulting term is \\(a^2b^2 \\times 1\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nOkay, so let me compute that. First, I'll find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Again, using the binomial theorem, this expansion is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\).\n\nWe need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be zero, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\).\n\nCalculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the second part), which is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nWait, but let me double-check that. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 20. So, when you multiply these two parts together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by the constant term from the second expansion, which is 20. So, the coefficient becomes 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So, the final answer is 120.\n\nWait, but just to make sure I didn't make any mistakes in the calculations. Let me go through it again.\n\nFirst, binomial coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\):\n\n\\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Correct.\n\nThen, for \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term where \\(c^0\\) is when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), so \\(m = 3\\).\n\n\\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Correct.\n\nMultiplying 6 * 20 gives 120. So, yes, the coefficient is 120.\n\nI think that's correct. So, the final answer is 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem for both parts of the product.\n\n1. **Expanding \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k} b^k\n   \\]\n   The term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\), so the coefficient is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\n   \\]\n\n2. **Expanding \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n   \\]\n   The term \\(c^0\\) (constant term) occurs when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which gives \\(m = 3\\). The coefficient is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\n   \\]\n\n3. **Combining the coefficients:**\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the product of the coefficients from each part:\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 20 = 120\n   \\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

    "text": " Wait, hold on, that's a bit confusing. So, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but the expression also has terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). Hmm, maybe I need to clarify whether the problem is just asking about the coefficient in the expansion of the entire expression, or if it's considering the product of both parts. Let me think.\n\nWait, the problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, it's the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion. That would mean that when we multiply out these two expressions, we're looking for the term where the variables are \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). But actually, wait, no. Because when you multiply two expressions, each term from the first expression gets multiplied by each term from the second expression. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) can only come from the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), because the second part doesn't have \\(a\\) or \\(b\\).

Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times some combination of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). Wait, that might not make sense because the variables are different.\n\nWait, perhaps I misread the problem. Let me check again. It says, \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, actually, in the entire product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would come from the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), and the second part would contribute terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems odd because the coefficient would then be a polynomial in \\(c\\). Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some specific \\(k\\), but it's not stated. Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating this.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, when you expand the entire product, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the sum of all the coefficients from the second part multiplied by the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part. So, if I can find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), and then multiply it by the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), that would give me the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product.\n\nWait, let me think again. When you multiply two expressions, each term from the first is multiplied by each term from the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expression comes with a coefficient, say, \\(C\\), and in the second expression, each term is a multiple of some power of \\(c\\), say, \\(d_k c^k\\). So, when you multiply them, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by each \\(d_k c^k\\), resulting in terms like \\(C d_k a^2b^2c^k\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would actually be a polynomial in \\(c\\), where each term is \\(C d_k c^k\\). But the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which might imply that it's considering the coefficient in the context of the entire expression, treating \\(c\\) as a variable as well. Hmm, but that seems complicated.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), ignoring the \\(c\\) terms. Because if you think about it, when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the \\(a^2b^2\\) term would be present in the first part, and multiplied by all the terms from the second part. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a sum over all possible terms involving \\(c\\), which seems odd.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\), and then the entire product would have that coefficient multiplied by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't make much sense because the variables are separate.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is actually a misstatement, and it's supposed to be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) or something like that, meaning the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), which would be the constant term in the \\(c\\) part. That might make sense. So, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). That would make sense because then you're looking for the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by the constant term in the \\(c\\) expansion.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\), and then separately considering the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but that seems unclear.\n\nWait, perhaps I should proceed step by step. Let me first find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\). Then, I can consider how it interacts with the second part. So, using the binomial theorem, \\((a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^4 \\binom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\\). So, the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) occurs is when \\(4 - k = 2\\), so \\(k = 2\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(\\binom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n\nNow, the second part is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Let me expand that. Using the binomial theorem, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^6 \\binom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(1/c\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^6 \\binom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\).\n\nSo, when we multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second. Therefore, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second part, resulting in terms like \\(6 a^2b^2 c^{6 - 2m}\\) for each \\(m\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is \\(6 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but that seems to be a function of \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because coefficients are constants.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, meaning that it's the sum of all coefficients of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for all \\(k\\). But that would mean that the coefficient is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part. The sum of all coefficients in the second part is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), so \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\nBut wait, that seems a bit high. Let me think again. If I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = (1 + 1)^6 = 64\\), so the total sum of coefficients is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). So, that would be the answer.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), which is the constant term in \\(c\\), then I would need to find the term where \\(c^{6 - 2m} = c^0\\), so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which gives \\(m = 3\\). The coefficient for that term is \\(\\binom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\) would be \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nBut the problem didn't specify anything about \\(c\\), so I think the first interpretation is correct, that it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the powers of \\(c\\), which would be \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). However, I'm not entirely sure. Let me check the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" It doesn't specify any condition on \\(c\\), so perhaps it's just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), treating \\(c\\) as another variable, so the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\). But that seems unlikely because the problem is asking for a coefficient, which is usually a number.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, treating all variables together. But that would mean that the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by some combination of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), but the problem is just asking for the coefficient, not specifying any particular power of \\(c\\). Hmm.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is miswritten, and it's supposed to be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would make sense. In that case, the coefficient would be \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\), as I calculated earlier.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which would be \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). But I'm not sure.\n\nWait, let me think again. The problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\).\" So, in the entire product, each term is a product of a term from the first part and a term from the second part. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) can only come from the first part, and it's multiplied by each term from the second part. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is actually the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire second part. So, the coefficient would be \\(6 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But that doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a coefficient, which is a number, not a polynomial.\n\nTherefore, perhaps the problem is actually to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), i.e., the constant term in \\(c\\). So, that would be \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\), as I thought earlier.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, considering all possible powers of \\(c\\), which would mean that the coefficient is a sum over all the terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by some power of \\(c\\). But that would mean that the coefficient is not a single number but a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense in this context.\n\nTherefore, I think the most reasonable interpretation is that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), i.e., the constant term in \\(c\\). So, that would be \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nWait, but let me check that. If I consider the entire product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first part with coefficient 6, and from the second part, the constant term is when \\(c^6 \\times (1/c)^6 = 1\\), so the coefficient is \\(\\binom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\) is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nAlternatively, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), then it's 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which would be \\(6 \\times \\left(c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15/c^2 + 6/c^4 + 1/c^6\\right)\\). But that would make the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a coefficient, implying a single number.\n\nTherefore, I think the intended question is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable, but that would mean the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which seems odd.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is just to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, ignoring the \\(c\\) terms, which would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second part. The sum of coefficients in the second part is when \\(c = 1\\), so \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient would be \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\nBut I'm not sure which interpretation is correct. Let me see if I can find similar problems or think about how coefficients work in products of polynomials.\n\nWhen you have two polynomials, say, \\(P(a, b)\\) and \\(Q(c)\\), their product is a polynomial in variables \\(a, b, c\\). The coefficient of a specific term, say \\(a^2b^2\\), in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(P(a, b)\\) multiplied by the entire polynomial \\(Q(c)\\). So, in this case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be \\(6 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient, which is typically a number, not a polynomial. Therefore, perhaps the problem is misworded, and it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be a number.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating \\(c\\) as a variable, but that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which is not a single number. Therefore, the only way the problem makes sense is if it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, ignoring the \\(c\\) terms, which would mean setting \\(c = 1\\), so the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\nBut I'm not sure. Let me think again.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider that the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, which would require considering all possible combinations of \\(a, b, c\\). But that's not standard. Typically, when you're asked for the coefficient of a specific term, like \\(a^2b^2\\), in a product of polynomials, it's in the context where the variables are separate, and you're looking for the coefficient of that term regardless of the other variables. But in this case, the other variables are \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), so perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times any power of \\(c\\), which would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire second part.\n\nBut that seems odd because the coefficient would then be a polynomial in \\(c\\). Therefore, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), which is a specific term.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable, which would mean that the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient, which is usually a number, so I think the intended answer is 120, considering the constant term in \\(c\\).\n\nTherefore, I think the answer is 120.\n\nBut to be thorough, let me calculate both possibilities.\n\nFirst, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nSecond, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nGiven that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), without specifying \\(c\\), I think the intended answer is 120, considering the constant term in \\(c\\).\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, treating \\(c\\) as a variable, which would be 6 * \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but that's a polynomial, not a number.\n\nTherefore, I think the correct answer is 120.\n\nWait, but let me check the expansion again. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first part with coefficient 6. The second part, when expanded, has terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). Therefore, when you multiply, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, resulting in terms like \\(6 a^2b^2 c^6\\), \\(6 a^2b^2 c^4\\), etc. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 times the entire second expansion, which is a polynomial in \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient is not a single number but a polynomial. Therefore, the problem is probably asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is miswritten, and it's supposed to be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be 120.\n\nTherefore, I think the answer is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Multiplying these gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\boxed{120}."

    "text": " Hmm, let me try to figure this out step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that when you have an expression like \\((x + y)^n\\), you can expand it using the binomial theorem, which states that each term in the expansion is of the form \\(\\binom{n}{k}x^{n-k}y^k\\). So, maybe I can apply this here.\n\nLooking at the given expression, there are two parts: \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is part of the first binomial, I think I can handle each part separately and then multiply them together, considering how they interact.\n\nWait, actually, no. The problem is about the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which comes from the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\). The second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), might affect the overall coefficient, but since we're only interested in the \\(a^2b^2\\) term, maybe the second part doesn't influence the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)? Hmm, that might not be the case. Let me think.\n\nWait, actually, when you multiply two expressions together, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression. So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I need to consider how that term interacts with all the terms in the second expression. But since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are variables separate from \\(c\\), I think the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire second expression, because \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\). Is that right?\n\nWait, no, that might not be correct. Because when you multiply the two expressions, each term from \\((a + b)^4\\) gets multiplied by each term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second part. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would be the sum of all the coefficients from the second expression multiplied by the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expression.\n\nWait, no, that might not be right either. Let me clarify.\n\nThe overall expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When you expand this, each term will be a product of a term from the first expansion and a term from the second expansion.\n\nSo, to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I need to consider all possible ways that \\(a^2b^2\\) can appear in the product. Since \\(a^2b^2\\) is only from the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), and the second part is in terms of \\(c\\), which is a different variable, perhaps the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\). But that seems a bit off because when you multiply, each term in the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part, so \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by every term in the second expansion, which would give \\(a^2b^2\\) times each term in the second expansion. But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), perhaps we're only considering the coefficient without any \\(c\\) terms. So, maybe we need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\) in the entire product.\n\nWait, that makes sense. Because \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term in the product, but to get it as a standalone term, it must be multiplied by \\(c^0\\) from the second part. So, the coefficient would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part.\n\nSo, first, let's find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\). Using the binomial theorem, the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is the sum from \\(k=0\\) to \\(4\\) of \\(\\binom{4}{k}a^{4 - k}b^k\\). So, the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) occurs is when \\(4 - k = 2\\), so \\(k = 2\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(\\binom{4}{2}\\), which is 6.\n\nNext, we need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Again, using the binomial theorem, the expansion is the sum from \\(m=0\\) to \\(6\\) of \\(\\binom{6}{m}c^{6 - m}\\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\), which simplifies to \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\binom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\). We need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be 0, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which gives \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(\\binom{6}{3}\\), which is 20.\n\nNow, since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, it's the product of the coefficients we found from each part. So, 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the second part) equals 120.\n\nWait, but let me double-check that. So, the first part gives us 6 for \\(a^2b^2\\), and the second part gives us 20 for \\(c^0\\). So when we multiply the two expressions, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part, but only the term with \\(c^0\\) will contribute to the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the product without any \\(c\\) terms. So, the coefficient is indeed 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in calculating the coefficients. So, for \\((a + b)^4\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is when \\(k=2\\), so \\(\\binom{4}{2} = 6\\). That seems correct. For \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0 is when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), so \\(m=3\\), and \\(\\binom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, 6 * 20 = 120. Yeah, that seems right.\n\nWait, but another way to think about it is that when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term is the sum of the products of coefficients of terms that multiply together to give that specific term. In this case, since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is if we take \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part and multiply it by the term with \\(c^0\\) from the second part. So, the coefficient is just 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nI think that makes sense. So, the final answer should be 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is found using the binomial theorem: \\(\\binom{4}{2} = 6\\). The coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\binom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying these gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\boxed{120}"

So maybe I can just focus on the \\((a + b)^4\\) part and then consider the other part separately.\n\nLet me think. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so I need to expand \\((a + b)^4\\) and find the term where \\(a\\) is squared and \\(b\\) is squared. Then, since the other part \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), it's just a constant multiplier for that term.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) because otherwise, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by some power of \\(c\\), but the problem just says \\(a^2b^2\\), so maybe it's considering all possible terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present, regardless of the power of \\(c\\). But that doesn't make much sense because \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term in the first part, and when multiplied by the second part, each term would have \\(a^2b^2\\) times some term from the second part. So maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, but that would mean that the coefficient is the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that seems a bit off.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating \\(c\\) as a variable, so the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by some terms involving \\(c\\), but the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So that would mean that the coefficient is the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient from the first part times the sum of the coefficients from the second part.\n\nWait, but that might not be correct. Let me think again. When you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum of the products of coefficients from each polynomial that combine to form that term. But in this case, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is being multiplied by every term in the second part, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Because each term in the second part is a coefficient times some power of \\(c\\), but since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient would be the product of the coefficient from the first part and the sum of all coefficients from the second part.\n\nSo first, let's find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\). Using the binomial theorem, \\((a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^4 \\binom{4}{k} a^{4 - k} b^k\\). So the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) occurs is when \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). So the coefficient is \\(\\binom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n\nNow, the second part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The sum of all coefficients in this expression can be found by setting \\(c = 1\\). So substituting \\(c = 1\\), we get \\((1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So the sum of all coefficients in the second part is 64.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. Because when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second. So the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part would be multiplied by every term in the second part. So the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would indeed be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the sum of all coefficients in the second part because each term in the second part contributes its coefficient to the product.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem was asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some specific \\(k\\), then we would have to find the coefficient of \\(c^k\\) in the second part and multiply it by the coefficient from the first part. But since the problem is just asking for \\(a^2b^2\\), without any condition on \\(c\\), I think the correct approach is to consider the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which is 64, and multiply it by 6, giving 384.\n\nWait, but let me check this with a small example to make sure. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). So expanding this, we get \\((a^2 + 2ab + b^2) \\times (c + 1/c)\\). The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be zero because \\(a^2\\) and \\(b^2\\) are separate terms. Wait, no, in this case, \\((a + b)^2\\) doesn't have an \\(a^2b^2\\) term; the highest degree is \\(a^2\\) and \\(b^2\\) separately. So maybe my initial approach is wrong.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me go back. The problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So when you expand this product, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\), which has a coefficient of 6, as I found before. Now, when this is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which when expanded has terms like \\(c^6\\), \\(6c^4\\), \\(15c^2\\), \\(20c^0\\), \\(15c^{-2}\\), \\(6c^{-4}\\), \\(c^{-6}\\). So each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is a coefficient times a power of \\(c\\).\n\nSo when we multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), we get terms like \\(6a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(36a^2b^2c^4\\), etc. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would be the sum of all coefficients of terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present, regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 times 64, which is 384.\n\nWait, but in my small example earlier, with \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually be zero because \\((a + b)^2\\) doesn't have an \\(a^2b^2\\) term. So maybe in that case, the coefficient is zero, but in our problem, \\((a + b)^4\\) does have an \\(a^2b^2\\) term, so the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of coefficients in the second part.\n\nWait, but in the small example, \\((a + b)^2\\) doesn't have \\(a^2b^2\\), so when multiplied by any term, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) remains zero. So in our problem, since \\((a + b)^4\\) does have \\(a^2b^2\\), the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second part, which is 64, giving 384.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, so it's just 6, but that seems unlikely because the entire expression includes the second part.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misinterpreting the problem. Maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating \\(c\\) as a variable, so the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would have a coefficient that's a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem doesn't specify any particular power of \\(c\\), so it's just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), which would be the same as the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients from the second part.\n\nWait, but in the expansion, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients in the second part. So yes, that would be 6 times 64, which is 384.\n\nWait, but let me check with another approach. Let's consider that the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). If I want the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I can treat \\(c\\) as a separate variable, so I can think of the expression as the product of two polynomials, one in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the other in \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, times the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which is 64, giving 384.\n\nAlternatively, if I'm supposed to consider \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms, then the coefficient would be 6 times the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 20. So that would give 6 times 20, which is 120. Hmm, that's a different answer. So now I'm confused.\n\nWait, so which is correct? If the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then it's 384. If it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it's 120.\n\nBut the problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", without mentioning \\(c\\), so perhaps it's considering all possible powers of \\(c\\). So in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which is 64, giving 384.\n\nBut wait, in the expansion, each term is a product of a term from the first part and a term from the second part. So the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part would be multiplied by each term in the second part, which includes different powers of \\(c\\). So if we're just looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then it's indeed 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which is 64, giving 384.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem had asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it would be 6 times the constant term in the second part, which is 20, giving 120.\n\nBut since the problem only specifies \\(a^2b^2\\), I think it's the former, 384.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Let's take a simple case. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^1 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, expanding, we have \\(a \\times c + a \\times (1/c) + b \\times c + b \\times (1/c)\\). So the coefficient of \\(a\\) would be the coefficient from the first part times the sum of coefficients from the second part. The coefficient of \\(a\\) in the first part is 1, and the sum of coefficients in the second part is \\((1 + 1) = 2\\), so the coefficient of \\(a\\) in the product would be 2, which would appear as \\(2a c + 2a (1/c)\\). But that's not correct because in reality, the coefficient of \\(a\\) is just 1 times each term in the second part, so the coefficient of \\(a c\\) is 1, and the coefficient of \\(a (1/c)\\) is also 1. So the total coefficient for \\(a\\) across all powers of \\(c\\) would be 2, which is the sum of coefficients in the second part times the coefficient from the first part.\n\nSimilarly, in our problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of coefficients in the second part, which is 64, giving 384. So I think that's correct.\n\nWait, but in the small example, the coefficient of \\(a\\) is 1, and the sum of coefficients in the second part is 2, so the total coefficient for \\(a\\) across all \\(c\\) terms is 2, which is correct because \\(a\\) appears as \\(a c\\) and \\(a (1/c)\\), each with coefficient 1, so total 2.\n\nTherefore, in our problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would indeed be 6 times 64, which is 384.\n\nWait, but let me check the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). The expansion is:\n\n\\[\n\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^6 \\binom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^6 \\binom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n\\]\n\nSo the coefficients are \\(\\binom{6}{k}\\) for each term \\(c^{6 - 2k}\\). The sum of all coefficients is when \\(c = 1\\), so it's \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\), as I found before.\n\nSo, yes, the sum of coefficients is 64, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me think again. When you have \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part, which includes \\(c^6\\), \\(6c^4\\), \\(15c^2\\), \\(20\\), \\(15c^{-2}\\), \\(6c^{-4}\\), \\(c^{-6}\\). So each of these would contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in different ways. But since the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), the coefficient would be the sum of all these contributions, which is 6 times (1 + 6 + 15 + 20 + 15 + 6 + 1) = 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem had asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it would be 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nBut since the problem is just asking for \\(a^2b^2\\), without any restriction on \\(c\\), the answer is 384.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit unsure because sometimes in problems like this, they might be looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would make more sense if they want a specific term. But since the problem didn't specify, I think it's safer to go with the interpretation that it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), which would be 384.\n\nWait, but let me check another angle. Suppose I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = (1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So the entire expression becomes \\((a + b)^4 * 64\\). Then, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 * 64 = 384, which matches our previous result. So that seems to confirm it.\n\nYes, I think that's correct. So the coefficient is 384.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{384}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break down the problem into two parts: the binomial expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) and the sum of coefficients in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^4 \\binom{4}{k} a^{4 - k} b^k\n   \\]\n   The term \\(a^2b^2\\) occurs when \\(k = 2\\), so the coefficient is:\n   \\[\n   \\binom{4}{2} = 6\n   \\]\n\n2. **Find the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   The sum of all coefficients in a polynomial is found by setting the variable to 1. Thus, we substitute \\(c = 1\\) into \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):\n   \\[\n   \\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\n   \\]\n\n3. **Multiply the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) by the sum of coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 64 = 384\n   \\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is \\(\\boxed{384}\\)."

    "text": " Hmm, okay, let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I remember that when you have an expression raised to a power like \\((a + b)^n\\), you can expand it using the binomial theorem. The binomial theorem states that \\((a + b)^n = \\sum_{k=0}^{n} \\dbinom{n}{k} a^{n - k} b^k\\). So, maybe I can apply that here.\n\nThe problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\), I need to find the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2. That means I'm looking for the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) appears.\n\nLet me write down the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\). Using the binomial theorem, it would be:\n\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\dbinom{4}{0}a^4b^0 + \\dbinom{4}{1}a^3b^1 + \\dbinom{4}{2}a^2b^2 + \\dbinom{4}{3}a^1b^3 + \\dbinom{4}{4}a^0b^4\n\\]\n\nSimplifying the binomial coefficients:\n\n- \\(\\dbinom{4}{0} = 1\\)\n- \\(\\dbinom{4}{1} = 4\\)\n- \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\)\n- \\(\\dbinom{4}{3} = 4\\)\n- \\(\\dbinom{4}{4} = 1\\)\n\nSo, the expansion becomes:\n\n\\[\n1 \\cdot a^4 + 4 \\cdot a^3b + 6 \\cdot a^2b^2 + 4 \\cdot ab^3 + 1 \\cdot b^4\n\\]\n\nFrom this, I can see that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. But wait, the problem isn't just about \\((a + b)^4\\); it's multiplied by another expression, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I need to consider how this multiplication affects the term \\(a^2b^2\\).\n\nLet me denote the first part as \\(A = (a + b)^4\\) and the second part as \\(B = \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the entire expression is \\(A \\times B\\). Since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term in \\(A\\), we need to consider how \\(A \\times B\\) will affect this term.\n\nBut wait, \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term in \\(A\\), and when we multiply by \\(B\\), which is a polynomial in \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), the variables involved are different. \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) don't appear in \\(B\\), and \\(c\\) doesn't appear in \\(A\\). So, when we multiply \\(A\\) and \\(B\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by every term in \\(B\\).\n\nHowever, since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\(A \\times B\\) will simply be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(A\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(B\\). But wait, that doesn't make sense because \\(B\\) includes terms with \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), which are different variables. So, actually, when we multiply \\(A\\) and \\(B\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in \\(B\\), resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2 \\cdot c^{-k}\\). But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and not considering the \\(c\\) terms, I think I might be misunderstanding the problem.\n\nWait, let me re-read the problem: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, it's asking for the coefficient of the term where the variables are \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). That is, we're looking for all terms in the expansion where \\(a\\) is squared, \\(b\\) is squared, and the exponents of \\(c\\) can be anything. But that seems a bit tricky because in the expansion, each term in \\(A\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(B\\), so \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by various powers of \\(c\\), but the coefficient for each of these terms will still include the 6 from \\(A\\). However, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which I think is just 6, but I'm not sure because \\(B\\) might contribute more.\n\nWait, no, because when you multiply \\(A\\) and \\(B\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from \\(A\\) will be multiplied by every term in \\(B\\), which is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will have coefficients multiplied by each term in \\(B\\), but the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would only be the case if the exponents of \\(c\\) are zero, meaning the term is just \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms. So, actually, we need to find the term in \\(B\\) where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, because that's the only term that, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), will result in a term that's just \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\) terms.\n\nWait, that makes sense. So, to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), we need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(B\\), which is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), and then multiply it by the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(A\\), which is 6.\n\nSo, let's first find the expansion of \\(B = \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Again, using the binomial theorem:\n\n\\[\n\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n\\]\n\nWe need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. So, set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\):\n\n\\[\n6 - 2k = 0 \\implies 2k = 6 \\implies k = 3\n\\]\n\nSo, the term where \\(k=3\\) is:\n\n\\[\n\\dbinom{6}{3} c^{6 - 2 \\times 3} = \\dbinom{6}{3} c^0 = \\dbinom{6}{3} \\times 1 = 20\n\\]\n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(B\\) is 20.\n\nNow, going back to the original expression, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(A \\times B\\) is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(A\\) multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(B\\). That is, 6 (from \\(A\\)) multiplied by 20 (from \\(B\\)), which equals 120.\n\nWait, but let me double-check that. Because when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each polynomial, provided that the variables multiply to give the desired term. In this case, since \\(A\\) has \\(a^2b^2\\) and \\(B\\) has a term with \\(c^0\\), when multiplied, the term will be \\(a^2b^2 \\times c^0 = a^2b^2\\), which is exactly what we're looking for. So, yes, the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nBut wait, is that correct? Let me think again. Because when you multiply two polynomials, each term in \\(A\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(B\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(A\\) is multiplied by every term in \\(B\\), which includes terms with different powers of \\(c\\). However, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would only consider the term where the exponents of \\(c\\) are zero, because otherwise, the term would have \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\) in it, making it not just \\(a^2b^2\\). So, only the term where \\(c^0\\) is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\) contributes to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient is indeed 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not missing anything. Let me think about the entire expansion. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). When expanded, each term will be of the form \\(a^k b^{4 - k} \\times c^m \\times (1/c)^n\\), where \\(k\\) ranges from 0 to 4, and \\(m + n\\) ranges from 0 to 6, with \\(m - n = p\\), depending on the term.\n\nBut we're only interested in the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present, regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). Wait, no, actually, no. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which implies that the term must have exactly \\(a^2b^2\\), and no other variables. So, the term must have \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by \\(c^0\\), because any other power of \\(c\\) would make the term have \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), which we don't want.\n\nSo, to clarify, in the product \\(A \\times B\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in \\(B\\), resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2c^{-k}\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, i.e., \\(a^2b^2 \\times c^0\\). Therefore, we need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(A\\) and multiply it by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(B\\), which is what I did earlier.\n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(A\\) is 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(B\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but let me make sure that I'm not overcomplicating this. Another way to think about it is that when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term is the sum of the products of the coefficients of terms whose variables multiply to give the desired term. In this case, since \\(A\\) has terms with \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and \\(B\\) has terms with \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), the variables are independent. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is simply the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(A\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(B\\). But that doesn't make sense because \\(B\\) includes terms with \\(c\\), which would make the term \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by \\(c^k\\) or \\(c^{-k}\\), which are different terms.\n\nWait, so perhaps I need to consider that the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(A\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(B\\), but only the term in \\(B\\) that has \\(c^0\\) will contribute to the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. All other terms in \\(B\\) will result in terms that have \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), which are not part of \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, only the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(B\\) contributes to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product.\n\nSo, to recap:\n\n- Coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(A = (a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n- Coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(B = \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 20.\n- Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\(A \\times B\\) is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, let me think about it in another way. Suppose I expand the entire product:\n\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\left(\\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\\right) \\times \\left(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\right)\n\\]\n\nWhen we multiply these two sums, each term will be \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k \\times \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\).\n\nWe are interested in the term where \\(a^{4 - k}b^k = a^2b^2\\). That means:\n\n- \\(4 - k = 2\\) \u21d2 \\(k = 2\\)\n- So, \\(b^k = b^2\\)\n\nSimilarly, for the \\(c\\) terms, we want \\(c^{6 - 2m}\\) to be \\(c^0\\), which means:\n\n- \\(6 - 2m = 0\\) \u21d2 \\(m = 3\\)\n\nTherefore, the term we're interested in is when \\(k=2\\) and \\(m=3\\). The coefficient for this term is:\n\n\\[\n\\dbinom{4}{2} \\times \\dbinom{6}{3} = 6 \\times 20 = 120\n\\]\n\nSo, that confirms it again. The coefficient is 120.\n\nI think I've thought this through multiple ways and each time I get 120 as the coefficient. So, I'm pretty confident that the answer is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Multiplying these gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\boxed{120}"
