So, I'm considering that the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and the \\(c^0\\) term in the second part multiply together to give the term \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is just \\(a^2b^2\\).

    "text": " Now, putting it all together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the two coefficients I found: 6 (from the \\(a^2b^2\\) term) and 20 (from the \\(c^0\\) term). So, 6 multiplied by 20 equals 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 120.\n\nWait a second, let me double-check my reasoning. I considered that the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first part is multiplied by the constant term in the second part. That makes sense because any other term in the second part would introduce a \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\) factor, which would mean the resulting term would have \\(c\\) in it, but since we're only looking for \\(a^2b^2\\), we can ignore those. So, the only contribution comes from the product of the \\(a^2b^2\\) term and the constant term in the second expansion. So, 6 times 20 is indeed 120. Hmm, that seems right.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of it as the entire product being \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When expanding this, each term in the expansion will be of the form \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}a^{4 - k}b^k \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - m}(1/c)^m\\). So, combining these, the term would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}\\dbinom{6}{m} a^{4 - k}b^k c^{6 - 2m}\\). Now, we want the term where \\(a^{4 - k}b^k\\) is \\(a^2b^2\\), so \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). So, that gives us \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) for the \\(a^2b^2\\) part, which is 6. Now, for the \\(c\\) part, we want \\(c^{6 - 2m}\\) to be \\(c^0\\), so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which gives \\(m = 3\\). The coefficient for that term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\), which is 20. So, the combined coefficient is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). So, that confirms my earlier result. Therefore, I'm confident that the coefficient is 120.\n\nWait, another way to think about it: the entire expression is a product of two independent binomial expansions. So, when you multiply them, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each expansion. Since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is by multiplying \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion with the term that has \\(c^0\\) from the second expansion. Any other term from the second expansion would introduce a \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\) factor, which we don't want. So, that means the coefficient is indeed the product of 6 and 20, which is 120.\n\nI think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations. So, the coefficient is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is found by multiplying the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) with the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\n1.

Since these two terms are multiplied together in the product, the overall coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Wait, let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes here. So, the first part was \\((a + b)^4\\), and I correctly found the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) as 6. Then, for \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), I correctly identified that the term with \\(c^0\\) is when \\(m = 3\\), and the coefficient is 20. Multiplying them together gives 120. Hmm, that seems right. I don't think I made any calculation errors here. So, the final answer should be 120. Let me just double-check by expanding a bit more. Alternatively, perhaps I can think of the entire expression as a product and see if the term \\(a^2b^2\\) only arises from those specific terms. So, when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion is 6\\(a^2b^2\\), and it's being multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But since we only want the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), we only consider the term in the second expansion that's a constant (i.e., \\(c^0\\)). So, that's 20. Therefore, 6 times 20 is indeed 120. Yep, that seems correct. So, the coefficient is 120. I think that's the answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem.\n\nFirst, consider the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\). Using the binomial theorem, we have:\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n\\]\nThe term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\). The coefficient for this term is:\n\\[\n\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\n\\]\n\nNext, consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem, we have:\n\\[\n\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n\\]\nWe need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0. Setting \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), we find \\(m = 3\\). The coefficient for this term is:\n\\[\n\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\n\\]\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficients from each expansion:\n\\[\n6 \\times 20 = 120\n\\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

Since these two terms are multiplied together in the product, the overall coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Wait, let me double-check that. So, when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficients multiply when the variables don't interfere. So, in this case, \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and the constant term in the second part, so yes, the coefficients should multiply. Therefore, 6 times 20 is indeed 120. So, the coefficient is 120.\n\nWait a second, did I consider all possibilities? Let me think again. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, as I found. Then, when I multiply by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in that expansion is multiplied by each term in \\((a + b)^4\\). So, the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms is to multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by the constant term in the second expansion, which is 20. So, yes, 6 times 20 is 120. I think that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of it as the entire expression being the product of two expansions. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) would be 120, but since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, that would just be 120. Wait, but actually, in the product, \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by all the terms in the second expansion, but we're only interested in the terms where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out, so that the product doesn't have any \\(c\\) terms. Therefore, only the constant term in the second expansion contributes to the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the product. So, yes, the coefficient is 6 times 20, which is 120.\n\nI think I'm confident with this answer now.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by considering the binomial expansions of each part. \n\n1.
