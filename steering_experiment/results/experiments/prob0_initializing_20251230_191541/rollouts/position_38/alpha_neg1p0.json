Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 120.\n\nWait, let me double-check that. So, the first part, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is indeed \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Correct. Then, for \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term where the exponent is 0 is when \\(m = 3\\), so \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Then, multiplying 6 and 20 gives 120. That seems right. But let me think again: when you expand \\((a + b)^4\\), you get terms like \\(a^4\\), \\(4a^3b\\), \\(6a^2b^2\\), \\(4ab^3\\), \\(b^4\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. Then, when you expand \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), you get terms where the exponents of \\(c\\) go from 6 down to -6 in steps of 2. The middle term is when \\(c^0\\), which is the term when \\(m = 3\\), so \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\), so that's correct. So, when you multiply the two expressions, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplies each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expression will be multiplied by each term in the second expression. However, only the term with \\(c^0\\) will result in a term that doesn't have \\(c\\). So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 * 20 = 120. I think that makes sense. So, I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning. Therefore, the coefficient should be 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).

    "text": " Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the two coefficients we found: \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Wait, but let me double-check that. Because the original expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, when we multiply these two, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\).

So, 6 times 20 is 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120. Hmm, but wait, let me think again. Is there any other term that could contribute to \\(a^2b^2\\) when multiplied by a term from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\)? For example, if I take a term from \\((a + b)^4\\) that's not \\(a^2b^2\\), like \\(a^3b\\), and multiply it by a term from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) that has \\(c^{-1}\\), would that ever result in a term that's \\(a^2b^2c^0\\)? Wait, no, because the variables are separate. The first part is in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the second part is in \\(c\\). So, when you multiply, the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) come only from the first polynomial, and the exponents of \\(c\\) come only from the second polynomial. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) can only come from the product of \\(a^2b^2\\) and any term in the second polynomial, but since we need the entire term to have no \\(c\\) (i.e., \\(c^0\\)), it's only when we multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by \\(c^0\\). So, yes, that's correct. Therefore, the coefficient is 6 times 20, which is 120. Wait, but let me check if I'm not making a mistake in the exponents. Let me write out the expansion more carefully. The expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is \\(a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). The expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is \\(c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15c^{-2} + 6c^{-4} + c^{-6}\\). Now, when we multiply these two expansions, each term from the first is multiplied by each term from the second. So, to get a term with \\(a^2b^2\\), we need to take the \\(6a^2b^2\\) term and multiply it by each term in the second expansion. However, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would only include the terms where the power of \\(c\\) is zero. Because if you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by \\(c^k\\), you get \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), which is not the same as \\(a^2b^2\\). So, only the term where \\(k = 0\\) in the second expansion will contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient is indeed 6 times 20, which is 120. So, I think that's correct.

But since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), the only way to get a term with \\(a^2b^2\\) is to take the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first polynomial and multiply it by the constant term (i.e., \\(c^0\\)) from the second polynomial. So, yes, that makes sense. So, the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120. I think that's correct. I don't see any other terms that would contribute to \\(a^2b^2\\) without involving \\(c\\).
