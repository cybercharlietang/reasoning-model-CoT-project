    "text": " So, in this expansion, the term with \\(a^2b^2\\) would be when \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). So, the coefficient would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Let me calculate that: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. \n\nBut wait, the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is just one part, but the whole expression is a product of two expansions. Hmm, so maybe I need to consider how this multiplication affects the coefficient. Let me think. If I have \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), then each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by every term in the second expansion. But wait, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\). So, I need to find the part of the expansion where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by a term that is just a constant (i.e., \\(c^0\\)), because if it's multiplied by a term with \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), then the resulting term would have \\(c\\) in it, which we don't want. So, essentially, I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), and then multiply it by the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion, which is 6. \n\nSo, now I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Again, I can use the binomial theorem for this. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying the exponents, that becomes \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m} = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, each term has an exponent of \\(6 - 2m\\). We want the term where the exponent is 0, because that's the constant term. So, set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is when \\(m = 3\\), and the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). \n\nSo, the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Therefore, when we multiply this by the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first expansion, which has a coefficient of 6, the overall coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). \n\nWait a second, let me double-check that. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first part with coefficient 6, and the constant term from the second part is 20. So, multiplying them together gives 120. That seems right. Is there any other term that could contribute to \\(a^2b^2\\)? Let me think. Since the second expansion only contributes a constant term to the product, any other terms from the second expansion would involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), which would mean that the resulting term would have \\(c\\) in it, so it wouldn't be part of the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. Therefore, only the constant term from the second expansion contributes to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). \n\nSo, putting it all together, the coefficient is 6 times 20, which is 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem.\n\nFirst, consider the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\). Using the binomial theorem, we have:\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n\\]\nThe term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\), so the coefficient is:\n\\[\n\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\n\\]\n\nNext, we need to find the constant term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem, we have:\n\\[\n\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n\\]\nWe seek the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, which occurs when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(m = 3\\). The coefficient is:\n\\[\n\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\n\\]\n\nThe constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficients from each expansion:\n\\[\n6 \\times 20 = 120\n\\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}."

    "text": " So, I need to find the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2. That would be when \\(4 - k = 2\\) for \\(a\\) and \\(k = 2\\) for \\(b\\). So, \\(k = 2\\). Therefore, the coefficient would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Let me compute that. \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. \n\nWait, but the original expression is \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I think the next step is to consider the entire expression. But, the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is part of the first factor. The second factor, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), involves \\(c\\) terms. But since the question is only about \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), perhaps I don't need to worry about the \\(c\\) terms? Wait, that might not be correct because when you multiply two expressions together, every term in the first expression gets multiplied by every term in the second expression. So, actually, the entire expression is a product of two polynomials, each with their own variables. But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, maybe I need to consider how the multiplication affects the coefficient. \n\nWait, but actually, the variables \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are only in the first part, and \\(c\\) is only in the second part. So, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since the question is only about the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term in the first factor, perhaps the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression will just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't make sense because the coefficient should be a number, not a polynomial. Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, considering all possible terms, including those involving \\(c\\). But no, the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so maybe it's just the coefficient from the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), multiplied by the entire second part, which is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of the second part, which would make the coefficient a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem just asks for the coefficient, not considering \\(c\\), so perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by every possible term from the second expansion, each with their own coefficients. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the entire second part. But that would mean the coefficient is 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial. But that seems odd because the problem is just asking for a numerical coefficient, not a polynomial.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misinterpreting the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times any power of \\(c\\), so the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that seems unlikely. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\). That would make sense because then the coefficient would be a number. So, maybe I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\) in the product.\n\nWait, that seems plausible. So, let me adjust my approach. So, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), which is the constant term with respect to \\(c\\). So, first, I'll find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, as I found earlier. Then, I'll need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Then, multiply these two coefficients together to get the final coefficient.\n\nWait, that makes sense. So, first, I have the coefficient from the first part, which is 6. Then, I need to find the constant term in the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me compute that.\n\nUsing the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, the exponent of \\(c\\) in each term is \\(6 - 2k\\). I need the term where the exponent is 0, because that's the constant term. So, I set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\). So, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Let me compute that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). So, the constant term in the second expansion is 20.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire product is the product of the two coefficients, which is 6 times 20, which equals 120.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. The first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), has a term \\(a^2b^2\\) with coefficient 6. The second part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), has a term \\(c^0\\) with coefficient 20. When you multiply these two parts together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by every term in the second part, including the \\(c^0\\) term. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is indeed 6 times 20, which is 120. \n\nAlternatively, if the problem was just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then it would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which would result in a polynomial in \\(c\\). But since the problem specifies the coefficient, I think it's more likely that it's asking for the coefficient when considering all variables, so the constant term with respect to \\(c\\), which is 120.\n\nWait, but let me make sure. The problem says, \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\". If it's in the entire product, then the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by terms involving \\(c\\), so the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which would be a polynomial. But that seems odd because usually, when asking for a coefficient, you specify all variables, unless it's implied that you're only considering specific variables.\n\nWait, perhaps I should look at the problem again. It says, \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\)\". So, perhaps it's considering all possible terms, so the coefficient would be 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, which seems unusual. Alternatively, maybe the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, without considering \\(c\\), which would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 times \\(2^6 = 6 \\times 64 = 384\\). But that doesn't make sense because the sum of coefficients is when you set \\(c = 1\\), but in this case, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by the entire expansion, so the coefficient would be 6 times the expansion. But that would be a polynomial, not a single coefficient.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think again. The problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, in the product, each term from the first expansion is multiplied by each term from the second expansion. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first expansion, and it's multiplied by each term in the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire second expansion. But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a coefficient, not an expression.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is only considering the terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\), so the constant term. That would make sense because then the coefficient would be a number. So, in that case, I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product. So, that would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part, which is 20, as I found earlier. So, 6 times 20 is 120. Therefore, the coefficient is 120.\n\nWait, but let me confirm this approach. If I expand \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) separately, then multiply them together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, which is a function of \\(c\\). But the problem is just asking for the coefficient, so maybe it's expecting a numerical value. Therefore, perhaps the problem is indeed asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is only considering the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) parts and ignoring the \\(c\\) terms, but that seems unlikely because the expression includes \\(c\\). So, I think the correct approach is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nWait, but let me think again. If I just consider \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. Then, when I multiply by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), etc. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would actually be the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by 6. But that would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). The sum of the coefficients in a polynomial is found by setting \\(c = 1\\). So, \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times 64, which is 384. But that contradicts my earlier conclusion of 120. So, which is correct?\n\nWait, now I'm confused. Let me clarify. When the problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", it's ambiguous unless it specifies with respect to all variables. If it's only considering \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), then the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial. But if it's considering the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it's 6 times the constant term in the second expansion, which is 20, giving 120.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is written as \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), and it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), the coefficient would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times the entire second factor. But that would make the coefficient a polynomial in \\(c\\), which seems odd. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting to treat \\(c\\) as another variable and find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), but that doesn't make much sense because the variables are separate.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where \\(a\\) is squared, \\(b\\) is squared, and \\(c\\) is to the zero power. That would make sense because then the coefficient would be a number. So, I think that's the correct interpretation.\n\nTherefore, to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), I need to compute the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), then multiply them together.\n\nAs I calculated earlier, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 20. So, multiplying these together, 6 times 20 is 120.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought that if I consider the entire expansion, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the entire second expansion, which would be a polynomial. But that can't be the case because the problem is asking for a coefficient, which should be a number. Therefore, the correct interpretation must be that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is written in a way that it's considering all possible exponents of \\(c\\), but that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, which seems unlikely. Therefore, I think the answer is 120.\n\nWait, but let me check my calculations again to be sure.\n\nFirst, \\((a + b)^4\\): the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n\nSecond, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\): the expansion is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). The term where the exponent is 0 is when \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), so \\(k = 3\\). The coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is 6 times 20, which is 120.\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, I think the final answer is 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break down the problem into two parts using the binomial theorem.\n\n1. **Expanding \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   We need the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2, which corresponds to \\(k = 2\\):\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\n   \\]\n   So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\n2. **Expanding \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n   \\]\n   We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, which corresponds to \\(6 - 2k = 0\\) or \\(k = 3\\):\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{6}{3} c^0 = 20\n   \\]\n   So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20.\n\n3. **Combining the results:**\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is the product of the coefficients found:\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 20 = 120\n   \\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}."

    "text": " That would correspond to the term where \\(4 - k = 2\\) for \\(a\\), so \\(k = 2\\). So, the coefficient here would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Let me calculate that: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\\). So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. But wait, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will be multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I think I don't need to worry about the \\(c\\) terms because they won't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) coefficients. Wait, actually, no. Let me think again. The expression is a product of two polynomials. So, when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion gets multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\), I think I can consider that term separately. So, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6a\u00b2b\u00b2, and when multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in that expansion will be multiplied by 6a\u00b2b\u00b2. However, since the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, the coefficient would just be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, no, that doesn't make sense. Because when you multiply 6a\u00b2b\u00b2 by, say, \\(c^6\\), you get 6a\u00b2b\u00b2c^6, and if you multiply it by \\(c^5\\), you get 6a\u00b2b\u00b2c^5, and so on. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term in the entire product. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 times the sum of all the terms in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems too broad because the problem might be expecting a specific coefficient, perhaps considering all possible terms, but I'm not sure. Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think again. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product. So, when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the \\(a^2b^2\\) term comes only from the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by every term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that can't be right because the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) would be when \\(c = 1\\), which is \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 * 64 = 384. But that seems too high. Alternatively, maybe I'm misunderstanding the question. Perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). In that case, the coefficient would indeed be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that would make the coefficient a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the problem is probably asking for a numerical coefficient. Wait, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating \\(c\\) as another variable. But that would mean that the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which would be 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems unlikely because the problem is probably expecting a numerical coefficient. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some \\(k\\), but it's not specified. Wait, the problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", so perhaps it's just considering \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, so the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would make the coefficient a polynomial, not a single number. Hmm, perhaps I'm missing something. Alternatively, maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the constant term with respect to \\(c\\). That would make sense because otherwise, the coefficient would be a polynomial. So, if that's the case, then I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product. So, first, find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiply it by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, now I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). To find the constant term, I can use the binomial theorem again. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\). So, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire expression is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). So, the coefficient is 120. Alternatively, if the problem was just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), then it would be 6 times the entire expansion, but that's not a single number, so I think the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break it down into two parts:\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term containing \\(a^2b^2\\) is when \\(k = 2\\):\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\n   \\]\n   So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\n2. **Find the constant term (coefficient of \\(c^0\\)) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   Using the binomial theorem:\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n   \\]\n   We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0:\n   \\[\n   6 - 2k = 0 \\Rightarrow k = 3\n   \\]\n   The constant term is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\n   \\]\n\n3. **Multiply the coefficients:**\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product is:\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 20 = 120\n   \\]\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

    "text": " So, in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will correspond to \\(k = 2\\), because \\(b^k\\) would be \\(b^2\\), and \\(a^{4 - k}\\) would be \\(a^{2}\\). So, the coefficient for that term is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Let me calculate that: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. \n\nBut wait, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). However, the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which suggests that we don't need to consider the terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\). Wait, is that correct? Or does the problem want the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times some term from the second expansion? Hmm, maybe I need to clarify that. \n\nWait, the question is \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\" in the entire expression. So, I think that means the coefficient of the term that has \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by any term from the second expansion, but since the second expansion involves \\(c\\) and \\(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\), which are different variables, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be the coefficient from the first part, because the second part doesn't affect the powers of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). So, perhaps the coefficient remains 6, regardless of the second expansion. But wait, that seems too straightforward. Let me think again. \n\nWait, actually, when you multiply two expressions together, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part, which is \\(6a^2b^2\\), when multiplied by each term in the second expansion \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), will produce terms like \\(6a^2b^2c^k\\) and \\(6a^2b^2 \\dfrac{1}{c^k}\\) for various \\(k\\). But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not any term that includes \\(c\\) or \\(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\). So, perhaps the coefficient remains 6, because the other terms would have \\(c\\) or \\(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\) attached to them, making them different from just \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just 6. \n\nBut wait, let me double-check that. Maybe I'm missing something. Let me think about how the multiplication works. The first part is \\((a + b)^4\\), which gives terms up to \\(a^4\\) and \\(b^4\\). The second part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which gives terms involving \\(c^6\\), \\(c^4\\), \\(c^2\\), \\(c^0\\), \\(\\dfrac{1}{c^2}\\), \\(\\dfrac{1}{c^4}\\), and \\(\\dfrac{1}{c^6}\\). So, when you multiply them together, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, giving terms like \\(6a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(6a^2b^2c^4\\), etc., but none of these will result in a term that's just \\(a^2b^2\\). The only way to get a term with just \\(a^2b^2\\) is if it's multiplied by a term in the second expansion that is 1, i.e., \\(c^0\\). So, is there a term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) that is \\(c^0\\)? Yes, because when you expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the middle term when \\(k = 3\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}c^{3} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^3 = \\dbinom{6}{3}c^{0} = 20\\). So, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by 20, giving \\(120a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120. \n\nWait, so I think I made a mistake earlier. I thought the coefficient was just 6, but actually, when you multiply by the second expansion, the only time \\(a^2b^2\\) appears without any \\(c\\) or \\(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\) is when it's multiplied by the constant term in the second expansion, which is 20. So, the coefficient becomes 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nLet me go through this again to make sure I'm correct. \n\nFirst, expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). \n\nNext, expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem. The general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\\). \n\nWe need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero because that's the only term that, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), will result in a term with just \\(a^2b^2\\). So, set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\). \n\nSo, the coefficient of the \\(c^0\\) term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). \n\nTherefore, when we multiply the two expansions together, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by 20, resulting in \\(120a^2b^2\\). \n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120. \n\nI think that makes sense. So, the key was realizing that the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion must be multiplied by the constant term (the term with \\(c^0\\)) in the second expansion to result in a term that's just \\(a^2b^2\\). All other terms in the second expansion would introduce a factor of \\(c\\) or \\(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\), which would change the term to something else, like \\(a^2b^2c\\) or \\(a^2b^2/c^2\\), etc. \n\nSo, to recap: \n\n1. Find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\): that's 6. \n\n2. Find the constant term (coefficient of \\(c^0\\)) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\): that's 20. \n\n3. Multiply these two coefficients together: 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120. \n\nI don't think I made any mistakes here, but let me just verify the binomial coefficients again to be sure. \n\nFor \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). \n\nFor \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the constant term is when \\(k = 3\\), so \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). \n\nYes, that seems correct. \n\nSo, the final answer is 120. \n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem.\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\), so the coefficient is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\n   \\]\n\n2. **Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n   \\]\n   We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, which occurs when \\(6 - 2k = 0\\).

Now, the expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Hmm, I wonder if that affects the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, no, because the second part is only in terms of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), so when we multiply the two expressions together, the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms will only come from the first part, and the \\(c\\) terms from the second part. But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not involving \\(c\\). So, does that mean the coefficient is just 6? Wait, no, maybe not. Because when you multiply the two expressions, the coefficients multiply as well. Wait, no, actually, no. Wait, let me think again. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since we're only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\), perhaps the coefficient is just 6 times the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion? But that doesn't seem right because the second expansion is multiplied by each term, but we're only interested in the \\(a^2b^2\\) term, which is independent of \\(c\\). Wait, actually, no. Because when you multiply, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part will be multiplied by every term in the second part. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, the sum of all coefficients in a polynomial is found by setting all variables to 1. So, if I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = (2)^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of the coefficients in the second part is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 * 64 = 384. Wait, but that seems too straightforward. Let me check again. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Since \\(a^2b^2\\) is only from the first part, and the second part is multiplied by it, but we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, so the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of the second part, which is 6 * \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the entire second expression, which is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the question is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\). Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, in the entire product, when you expand it, what's the coefficient for the term \\(a^2b^2\\). Since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) only come from the first part, and the second part is in terms of \\(c\\), the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will be multiplied by every term in the second part. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients of all terms in the second expansion, because each term in the second expansion is a coefficient times some power of \\(c\\), but when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), it's just 6 times each coefficient. So, the total coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). As I calculated before, the sum of coefficients is when \\(c = 1\\), so \\(2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, 6 * 64 = 384. So, the coefficient is 384. Wait, but let me think differently. Maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of \\(c\\). So, perhaps the answer is 6 * \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that would be a polynomial in \\(c\\), and the coefficient would depend on \\(c\\). But the question is asking for a numerical coefficient, so I think my first approach is correct: 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second part, which is 64, so 6*64=384. Alternatively, perhaps I'm wrong, and the answer is just 6, because the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and the second part doesn't affect it. Wait, but no, because when you multiply, each term from the first part is multiplied by each term from the second part. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by every term in the second part, which has various coefficients. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which is 64, so 6*64=384. Wait, but let me confirm this with an example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^2 (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, expanding, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^0\\) would be \\(\\dbinom{2}{0} = 1\\), and the coefficient of \\(a^1b^1\\) would be \\(\\dbinom{2}{1}=2\\), and \\(a^0b^2\\) would be 1. Now, multiplying by \\((c + 1/c)\\), each of these coefficients would be multiplied by \\(c + 1/c\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^0\\) would have a coefficient of 1*(c + 1/c), so the coefficient for \\(a^2b^0c^1\\) is 1, and for \\(a^2b^0c^{-1}\\) is also 1. Similarly, \\(a^1b^1\\) would have coefficients 2*(c + 1/c), so 2c and 2/c, etc. So, in this case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^0\\) is \\(c + 1/c\\), which is a sum of coefficients 2, but each term has a coefficient of 1. So, in this case, if I were to ask for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^0\\), it's \\(c + 1/c\\), but if I were to ask for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^0c^0\\), that would be 0, because there's no constant term in \\(c + 1/c\\). But in the original problem, we're just being asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6*(sum of coefficients in the second part), which is 6*64=384. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to consider that \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term, and the coefficient is just 6, because the other part is multiplied by it, but that doesn't affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, but that doesn't make sense because when you multiply, each term is scaled by the coefficients from the other expansion. So, for example, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part, so each of those terms would have coefficients, and when you collect like terms, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the sum of all those products. But since the second part is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which expands to a sum of terms with coefficients, the total coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which is 6*64=384. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to have the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), but the problem doesn't specify, so I think the correct interpretation is that it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), so the answer is 384. Wait, but let me think again. Maybe I'm overcomplicating it. The problem is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, when you expand this, each term is of the form \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}a^{4 - k}b^k \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - m}(1/c)^m\\), which simplifies to \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}\\dbinom{6}{m} a^{4 - k}b^k c^{6 - 2m}\\). Now, we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which means \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). So, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\dbinom{6}{m}\\), but m can be any value from 0 to 6, because we're not restricting the power of c. Wait, but that would mean the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) times the sum over all m of \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\). But the sum over all m of \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\) is \\(2^6 = 64\\), so the total coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} \\times 64 = 6 \\times 64 = 384\\). So, that confirms my earlier calculation. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by considering the expansion of each part. \n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\)** using the binomial theorem:\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k=2\\), so its coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n\n2. **Consider the second part** \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).

Because when you take \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part and multiply it by each term in the second part, each of those terms will contribute a factor, but since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), all the \\(c\\) terms just get multiplied by 1 (the coefficient part), so effectively, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all coefficients in the second part. \n\nWait, but actually, the second part is a Laurent polynomial in \\(c\\), so it's not just a polynomial, but it includes negative exponents. However, when considering the product, each term in the second part will contribute a coefficient multiplied by some power of \\(c\\), but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Because when you distribute, each term in the first part multiplies each term in the second part, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the sum of coefficients in the second part, because each term in the second part, regardless of \\(c\\), just adds a multiple when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\).\n\nBut wait, actually, that's not quite right. Because the second part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The sum of its coefficients is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), right? Because when you substitute \\(c = 1\\), you get the sum of the coefficients. So, let me compute \\(\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of the coefficients in the second part is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 64 (sum of coefficients in the second part), which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me verify this. Alternatively, maybe I should think about it differently. When you have two expressions multiplied together, say \\( (a + b)^4 \\) and \\( (c + 1/c)^6 \\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expression multiplied by the entire second expression, because the second expression doesn't have any \\(a\\) or \\(b\\) terms. So, in other words, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 multiplied by the entire second expression. But since we're just looking for the coefficient, and the second expression is a sum of terms with \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times each coefficient in the second expression, but since the question is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, the coefficient is 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second expression, which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but actually, I think that's correct. Because when you have two polynomials multiplied together, the coefficient of a specific term in one polynomial is multiplied by the entire other polynomial. So, in this case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and when you multiply that by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the coefficient becomes 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But since the question is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, it's 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but actually, no, that's not quite right. Because the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is a sum of terms, each with a coefficient and a power of \\(c\\). So, when you multiply 6 by each term in the expansion, each term becomes 6 times the coefficient times the corresponding power of \\(c\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Because when you add up all the terms in the expansion, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times each coefficient in the second expansion, but since each term in the second expansion is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), the overall coefficient is 6 times the sum of coefficients in the second expansion.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps a better way is to realize that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is simply the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient, not the entire term, it's 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Maybe I'm overcomplicating it. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). When you expand this, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second part. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part (which is 6) multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. But since the question is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, it's 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but perhaps another approach is to note that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Because when you multiply terms, the exponents add up. So, to get a term with \\(a^2b^2\\), you need to multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part by a term with \\(c^0\\) from the second part. Because \\(c^0\\) is the only term that won't affect the exponent of \\(c\\), so that the resulting term will have \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is just \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient is 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\).\n\nHmm, that might be a better approach. Let me try that. So, first, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. Then, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is the middle term when expanding, since the exponents go from 6 down to -6. The term with \\(c^0\\) is when the exponent is 0, so let's find that.\n\nUsing the binomial theorem, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(1/c\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We want the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so 6 - 2k = 0. Solving for k: 6 - 2k = 0 \u21d2 2k = 6 \u21d2 k = 3. So, the term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} c^{0} = \\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the second part), which is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, now I'm confused because earlier I thought it was 384, but now I'm getting 120. Which one is correct?\n\nLet me re-examine. The first approach was that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, so 6*64=384. But the second approach says that the coefficient is 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion, which is 20, so 6*20=120.\n\nWhich is correct? Let me think about the multiplication. The product is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). When you expand this, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, for example, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be \\(a^2b^2\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But since the question is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion. But that doesn't make sense because the expansion includes different powers of \\(c\\). Wait, no, actually, when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, each term will be \\(a^2b^2 \\times \\text{coefficient} \\times c^k\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the sum of all the coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by 6. So, the coefficient is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion.\n\nBut wait, the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion is when \\(c = 1\\), which is \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). So, 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nBut in the second approach, I considered only the coefficient of \\(c^0\\), which is 20, and multiplied by 6 to get 120.\n\nWhich is correct? Let me test with a smaller example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^1 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Let's compute the coefficient of \\(a^1b^0\\) in this product.\n\nFirst, \\((a + b)^1 = a + b\\). The coefficient of \\(a^1b^0\\) is 1.\n\nThe second part, \\((c + 1/c)^1 = c + 1/c\\). The sum of coefficients is when \\(c=1\\): 1 + 1 = 2.\n\nSo, according to the first approach, the coefficient of \\(a^1b^0\\) in the product would be 1 * 2 = 2.\n\nBut let's compute the product: \\((a + b)(c + 1/c) = a c + a/c + b c + b/c\\). The terms involving \\(a\\) are \\(a c\\) and \\(a/c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a\\) (which is \\(a^1b^0\\)) is \\(c + 1/c\\). But if we're just looking for the coefficient, regardless of \\(c\\), it's the sum of the coefficients, which is 2. So, in this case, the first approach gives the correct result.\n\nAlternatively, if I use the second approach, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\((c + 1/c)^1\\) is 0, because there is no \\(c^0\\) term. So, the coefficient of \\(a^1b^0\\) would be 1 * 0 = 0, which is incorrect. So, the second approach is wrong in this case.\n\nTherefore, the correct approach is the first one: the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). The sum of coefficients is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\(2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but in my earlier small example, that worked. So, why did I think of the second approach? Maybe because I was confused about whether the \\(c\\) terms affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). But actually, when you multiply by each term in the second expansion, each term contributes a coefficient to the product term \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the total coefficient is the sum of all those contributions, which is the coefficient from the first part times the sum of coefficients from the second part.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be 384.\n\nWait, but let me double-check with another example. Let's take \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^2\\). Let's compute the coefficient of \\(a^2b^0\\).\n\nFirst, \\((a + b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2\\). The coefficient of \\(a^2b^0\\) is 1.\n\nThe second part, \\((c + 1/c)^2 = c^2 + 2 + 1/c^2\\). The sum of coefficients is when \\(c=1\\): 1 + 2 + 1 = 4.\n\nSo, according to the first approach, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^0\\) in the product is 1 * 4 = 4.\n\nBut let's compute the product: \\((a^2 + 2ab + b^2)(c^2 + 2 + 1/c^2)\\). The terms involving \\(a^2\\) are \\(a^2c^2\\), \\(2a^2\\), and \\(a^2/c^2\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) (regardless of \\(c\\)) is 1 * c^2 + 2 * 1 + 1 * 1/c^2. The sum of the coefficients is 1 + 2 + 1 = 4, which matches the first approach.\n\nAlternatively, the second approach would say the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion is 2, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^0\\) would be 1 * 2 = 2, which is incorrect. Therefore, the first approach is correct.\n\nTherefore, returning to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought of another approach where I considered the term \\(a^2b^2\\) being multiplied by \\(c^0\\), giving 6 * 20 = 120. But that seems to be incorrect, as per the smaller example.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I was confused because in the original problem, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by all terms in the second expansion, each contributing their coefficients, so the total coefficient is 6 * sum of coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nTherefore, I think the correct answer is 384.\n\nWait, but let me compute it directly. Let's expand \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) separately and see.\n\nFirst, \\((a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6.\n\nNow, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) can be expanded as \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, the expansion is \\(c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15/c^2 + 6/c^4 + 1/c^6\\).\n\nSo, the sum of the coefficients is when \\(c = 1\\): \\(1 + 6 + 15 + 20 + 15 + 6 + 1 = 64\\), which matches our earlier calculation.\n\nTherefore, when we multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Suppose I have two polynomials, P(a, b) and Q(c). Then, the product P(a, b) * Q(c) would have terms where each term in P is multiplied by each term in Q. So, the coefficient of a specific term in P, say \\(a^2b^2\\), would be that coefficient multiplied by each term in Q. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient in P times the entire Q. But since Q is a polynomial in c, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the coefficient in P times the sum of coefficients in Q, because when you multiply by each term in Q, each term contributes its coefficient to the product term \\(a^2b^2\\).\n\nTherefore, the coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So, I think the correct answer is 384.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought of 120, but that was a mistake because I was considering only the \\(c^0\\) term, which is incorrect. The correct approach is to multiply the coefficient from the first part by the sum of coefficients from the second part, which is 64, leading to 384.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\(2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\(\\boxed{384}\\)."

    "text": " So, in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\), the term with \\(a^2b^2\\) would be when \\(4 - k = 2\\), which means \\(k = 2\\). So, the coefficient would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Let me compute that: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. \n\nBut wait, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the \\(c\\) terms might affect the coefficient? Hmm, no, actually, when you multiply two expressions together, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression. But since we're only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), the terms involving \\(c\\) would just multiply the coefficient by some value, but the \\(a^2b^2\\) term itself doesn't depend on \\(c\\). So, does that mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)? Wait, that doesn't sound right because the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is separate. So, perhaps I need to consider how the product works. Let me think: When I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by every term in the second expansion. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), perhaps the other factors involving \\(c\\) just contribute a scalar multiple? Wait, no, because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by, say, \\(c^6\\), you get \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), which is a different term. But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. Hmm, actually, that might not be the case. Wait, let me read the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)\". So, it's asking for the coefficient of the term that has exactly \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in other words, we're looking for all terms in the product where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2 each, and we're summing their coefficients. So, each term in the product will be of the form \\(a^2b^2 \\times c^k \\times \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\), but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), we need to consider all the terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any combination of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), and sum their coefficients. So, that means the coefficient will be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, no, that's not quite right. Because when you multiply, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) gets multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, no, that's not accurate either because the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) would be obtained by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). But in this case, we don't need the sum of all coefficients, but rather, each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) contributes a coefficient when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, that doesn't make sense because the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is separate; it doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. So, perhaps the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is 6 times something, but that something is an expression in \\(c\\), not a scalar. So, maybe I'm approaching this wrong. Wait, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), meaning that we're looking for all terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present, multiplied by any power of \\(c\\), and we need to sum their coefficients. So, in that case, the coefficient would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) has a coefficient, and when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), that coefficient becomes part of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. So, if I let \\(C\\) be the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be \\(6 \\times C\\). Now, how do I find \\(C\\)? Well, the sum of all coefficients in a polynomial is obtained by setting all variables to 1. So, in this case, set \\(c = 1\\), and compute \\(\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = (1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). \n\nWait, but let me double-check that. Because when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each polynomial. But in this case, since \\(a^2b^2\\) is in the first polynomial and any term from the second polynomial will be multiplied by it, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would indeed be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial. So, yes, that makes sense. So, 6 times 64 is 384. Therefore, the coefficient is 384. \n\nAlternatively, another way to think about it is that when you expand the entire expression, each term will be of the form \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}a^{4 - k}b^k \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - m}\\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). So, simplifying the second part, \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the term becomes \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}\\dbinom{6}{m}a^{4 - k}b^k c^{6 - 2m}\\). Now, we want the terms where \\(a^2b^2\\), which means \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). So, for each \\(m\\), the term will contribute \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\dbinom{6}{m}a^2b^2c^{6 - 2m}\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\sum_{m=0}^{6}\\dbinom{6}{m}\\), because for each \\(m\\), we have a term contributing \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\) times \\(a^2b^2c^{6 - 2m}\\). But the sum of \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\) from \\(m=0\\) to \\(6\\) is \\(2^6 = 64\\), as we found earlier. Therefore, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). So, that confirms it again. \n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not missing anything. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in the expanded product, \\(a^2b^2\\) can be multiplied by any power of \\(c\\), but since the problem doesn't specify a particular power of \\(c\\), we have to consider all possible terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present, each multiplied by their respective coefficients from the second polynomial. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed the coefficient from the first polynomial times the sum of all coefficients from the second polynomial. \n\nAlternatively, if the problem had asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some specific \\(k\\), then we would have to compute \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\dbinom{6}{m}\\) where \\(6 - 2m = k\\). But since it's just \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\), we sum over all possible \\(m\\), which gives us the total sum of coefficients from the second polynomial, which is 64. So, 6 times 64 is 384. \n\nTherefore, after all this thinking, I believe the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplying it by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is \\(2^6 = 64\\). Thus, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{384}."

So, solving \\(4 - k = 2\\) gives \\(k = 2\\). Therefore, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Let me compute that. \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient from the first part is 6. Now, the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but the term \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), so when I multiply the two expansions, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) will be the product of the coefficient from the first part and the coefficient of the constant term (i.e., the term where the power of \\(c\\) is zero) in the second expansion. Because when I multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by something, I don't want any \\(c\\) terms; I just want the constant term to keep it as \\(a^2b^2\\). So, I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me think about that. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is also a binomial expansion. Using the binomial theorem, it's \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). Now, I'm looking for the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, because that's the constant term. So, set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Let me compute that. \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). Wait, that seems a bit off. Let me check again. 6! is 720, 3! is 6, so 3!3! is 6\u00d76=36. 720 divided by 36 is indeed 20. So, the constant term is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the two coefficients I found: 6 from the first part and 20 from the second part. So, 6 \u00d7 20 = 120. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake. Is there another way to approach this? Maybe not, but let me double-check each step. First, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). That's correct. Then, in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the constant term occurs when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), so \\(m = 3\\). The coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). That's correct too. So, when I multiply the two expressions, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. Since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term in the first expansion, and the constant term is 20 in the second, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be 6 \u00d7 20 = 120. Hmm, that seems right. Wait, but is there a possibility that I'm supposed to consider more terms? Let me think. The problem asks for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\). So, any term in the product that includes \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\) would result in a term like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2/c^k\\), which would not be \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, only the constant term in the second expansion contributes to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, I think my approach is correct. Therefore, the coefficient is 120. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't miss anything. Maybe I should write out the expansions more explicitly. So, \\((a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6. Then, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15/c^2 + 6/c^4 + 1/c^6\\). So, the constant term is 20. So, when I multiply these two expansions, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion will be multiplied by 20, giving 20a^2b^2. So, the coefficient is 20 \u00d7 6 = 120. Yep, that seems correct. I don't think I made any mistakes here. So, the final answer should be 120.\n\nWait, hold on, just to be thorough, let me consider another approach. Maybe using multinomial coefficients or generating functions. But in this case, since the expression is a product of two binomials, the approach I took is the most straightforward. Alternatively, I could consider that the entire expression is a product of two independent expansions, so the coefficients multiply when looking for the constant term. So, I think my initial method is solid. Therefore, I'm confident that the coefficient is 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem.\n\nFirst, consider the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n\\]\nWe need the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) appears. This occurs when \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). The coefficient is:\n\\[\n\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\n\\]\n\nNext, consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem:\n\\[\n\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n\\]\nWe need the constant term, which occurs when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\).

Let me calculate that: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient is 6. \n\nBut wait, the original expression isn't just \\((a + b)^4\\); it's multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I need to consider how this multiplication affects the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Hmm, I think I need to expand both parts separately and then multiply them together, but I'm not entirely sure. Let me think. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Since these are two separate binomials being multiplied, maybe the coefficients multiply as well? Wait, no, not exactly. Because when you multiply two expressions, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression. But in this case, we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, I don't need to worry about the other variables, \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), because \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\). That means that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression will just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, that doesn't seem right because \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) has multiple terms. So, maybe I need to consider how the multiplication affects the coefficient. Let me clarify: when you multiply two expressions, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, if I'm looking for a specific term in the product, say \\(a^2b^2\\), it can come from multiplying a term in \\((a + b)^4\\) by a term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), it means that the term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) must be a constant term, right? Because otherwise, the product would involve \\(c\\) terms, which we don't want. So, I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), and then multiply it by the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\). \n\nAlright, so let's tackle \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) first. Again, using the binomial theorem, this expansion would be \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying that, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\times c^{-m} = \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). Now, we're looking for the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero because that's the constant term. So, we set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\) and solve for \\(m\\). \n\n\\(6 - 2m = 0\\)\n\nSubtract 6 from both sides:\n\n\\(-2m = -6\\)\n\nDivide both sides by -2:\n\n\\(m = 3\\)\n\nSo, the constant term occurs when \\(m = 3\\). The coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Let me compute that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). Wait, that doesn't seem right. Let me check the calculation again. 6! is 720, 3! is 6, so 6!/(3!3!) is 720/(6*6) = 720/36 = 20. Yeah, that's correct. So, the constant term is 20. \n\nNow, going back to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Since these two terms are multiplied together in the product, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nWait a minute, let me make sure I didn't miss anything. So, the expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). When I expand both, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the multiplication of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and the constant term in the second part. Because if I take any term from the second part that has \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), then the product would have \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2/c^k\\), which isn't what we want. So, only the constant term from the second part contributes to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient is indeed 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nLet me just recap to ensure I didn't make a mistake. First, I found the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6. Then, I found the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 20. Multiplying these together gives 120, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120. I think that makes sense because each part is independent of the other variables, so their coefficients multiply when considering the product. \n\nI don't think I made any calculation errors, but let me double-check the binomial coefficients. For \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\), which is 6. Correct. For \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the constant term is when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, which happens when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), so \\(m = 3\\), and \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Correct. So, 6 * 20 = 120. Yep, that seems right. \n\nI guess another way to think about it is that when you have two separate products, the coefficients multiply for the terms that don't interfere with each other. Since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), their coefficients just multiply. So, 6 from the first part and 20 from the second part, multiplied together, give 120. \n\nSo, I'm pretty confident that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem for both parts of the expression.\n\nFirst, consider the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\). Using the binomial theorem, we have:\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n\\]\nWe need the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which occurs when \\(k = 2\\). The coefficient is:\n\\[\n\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\n\\]\n\nNext, consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem, we have:\n\\[\n\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n\\]\nWe need the constant term, which occurs when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. Solving \\(6 - 2m = 0\\) gives \\(m = 3\\). The coefficient is:\n\\[\n\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\n\\]\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficients from each part:\n\\[\n6 \\times 20 = 120\n\\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}."

The term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is a term on its own, and when you multiply by the second part, which is a polynomial in \\(c\\), each term in the second part will multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2c^{-k}\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would only consider the terms where the powers of \\(c\\) are zero, because otherwise, the term would have \\(c\\) in it. So, perhaps I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), and then multiply that by the coefficient from the first part, which is 6.

When we multiply these two expressions, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are different variables, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) can only come from a term in \\((a + b)^4\\) that has \\(a^2b^2\\) and a term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) that has \\(1\\), because otherwise, you'd have extra variables. Wait, that seems right. So, in other words, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is equal to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) (i.e., the constant term) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by the constant term, you get \\(a^2b^2 \\times \\text{constant}\\), which is the term we're interested in. So, first, I found that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. Now, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me think about how to find that. Again, using the binomial theorem, but this time for \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, expanding this, we get \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k\\).

    "text": " That would be when \\(a^2b^2\\) is present in the expansion. So, looking at \\((a + b)^4\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) occurs when the exponent of \\(a\\) is 2 and the exponent of \\(b\\) is 2. So, in the binomial expansion, that would correspond to \\(k = 2\\), because the exponent of \\(b\\) is \\(k\\). So, the coefficient would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Let me calculate that. \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. Now, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is multiplied by every term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and that term doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would just be 6 times the coefficient of the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), right? Wait, no, that's not quite right. Because actually, each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\), the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, that doesn't make sense because we're just looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not considering \\(c\\). Wait, no, actually, the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part will be multiplied by every term from the second part. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that's not correct either because the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) are not all summed together; instead, each term is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But actually, no, that's not right because each term in the product is a separate term. Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again. The problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, in other words, we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). That means that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, that doesn't sound right because when you multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) would have its own coefficient, and when you multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), those coefficients would just carry over. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is obtained by setting \\(c = 1\\), so that would be \\((1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times 64, which is 384. But wait, that seems too high. Let me check again. Alternatively, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Maybe the question is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, without considering the \\(c\\) terms. So, in other words, when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the \\(a^2b^2\\) term is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, as I thought earlier, setting \\(c = 1\\) gives the sum of coefficients, which is \\(2^6 = 64\\), so 6 * 64 = 384. But that seems high because the problem might not require that. Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Let me try another approach. Maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, in that case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of all the terms in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384. But maybe I'm missing something here. Let me think again. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, meaning that the coefficient is 6 multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that would make the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a single coefficient. Therefore, perhaps I've misread the problem. Let me check again. The problem says: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, in other words, in the entire product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) can be multiplied by any power of \\(c\\), but we're just looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) irrespective of the \\(c\\) terms. So, that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, without considering the \\(c\\) terms, meaning that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in the second expansion. So, 6 * 64 = 384. But that seems like a lot, so maybe I'm wrong. Let me try another approach. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, which would involve considering the product of the two expansions. So, perhaps I should expand both expressions and find the coefficient. But that might be time-consuming, but let's try. First, expand \\((a + b)^4\\). As we did earlier, the expansion is \\(a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. Now, expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem, this would be \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, the expansion is \\(c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15\\dfrac{1}{c^2} + 6\\dfrac{1}{c^4} + \\dfrac{1}{c^6}\\). So, each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is a power of \\(c\\). Now, when we multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion (which has coefficient 6) is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients in the second expansion. Because each term in the second expansion is a coefficient times some power of \\(c\\), and when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), it becomes a term with coefficient 6 times that coefficient, and the power of \\(c\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), we need to sum all the coefficients from the second expansion and multiply by 6. So, the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\). So, \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 * 64 = 384. But let me check again because that seems high. Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think differently. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, in other words, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384. So, I think that's the answer. But let me make sure I'm not missing anything. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, considering that the product includes both \\(a, b, c,\\) and \\(1/c\\). But since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. Yeah, that seems to make sense. So, I think the coefficient is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\(\\boxed{384}\\)."

    "text": " So, in this expansion, I need to find the term where the exponents of a and b are both 2. That would correspond to \\(k = 2\\) because \\(4 - k = 2\\) implies \\(k = 2\\). So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Let me calculate that: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\\). So, the coefficient from the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), is 6 for \\(a^2b^2\\). Now, the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Hmm, so I need to consider how this multiplication affects the coefficient. Wait, but the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is only from the first part, right? So, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will be multiplied by every term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since we're only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve c, I think the coefficient will be the same as the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part, but wait, that doesn't make sense because the second part is multiplied by the first. Wait, no, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would just be the coefficient from the first part, because the second part doesn't affect the a and b terms. Wait, no, that's not right. Because when you multiply two expressions, each term from the first expression gets multiplied by each term from the second. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which comes from the first part, the second part can be any term, but since it's multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), the coefficient will be the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all coefficients from the second part. Wait, no, that's not correct either. Because when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is multiplied by every term in the second part, which includes terms with c and 1/c. But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the c terms, I think we need to consider that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all the coefficients from the second part. But wait, no, that's not right because each term in the product would be a combination of a term from the first and a term from the second. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the sum of all coefficients from the second part, because each term in the second part, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), would contribute to the overall coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. Wait, but that doesn't sound right because the second part has terms with c and 1/c, so when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by, say, \\(c^3\\), you get \\(a^2b^2c^3\\), which is a different term. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would just be the coefficient from the first part, because the second part doesn't affect the a and b exponents. Therefore, the coefficient remains 6. But wait, that seems too simple. Let me think again. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When you expand this, each term in the expansion will be of the form \\(\\text{term from first expansion} \\times \\text{term from second expansion}\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the c terms, it's like we're treating the entire product as a polynomial in a and b, with coefficients that are polynomials in c. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient from the first part times the entire second expansion, because every term in the second expansion, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), contributes to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but the sum of the coefficients in a polynomial is found by setting all variables to 1. So, if I set c = 1 in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), I get \\((1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of the coefficients in the second part is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times 64, which is 384. Wait, that seems high. Let me check my reasoning again. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product. Since \\(a^2b^2\\) is only present in the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), and the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), doesn't affect the exponents of a and b, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would simply be the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the entire second part. But that doesn't make sense because the second part isn't a constant; it's a polynomial in c. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all coefficients in the second part, because each term in the second part contributes to the overall coefficient when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the sum of coefficients in the second part is found by substituting c = 1, which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 * 64 = 384. Hmm, but I'm not entirely sure if that's the correct approach. Let me think differently. Maybe I should consider that the entire expression is a product of two polynomials, and when you multiply them, the coefficient of a specific term is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each polynomial. But in this case, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) only comes from the first polynomial, so the coefficient would be the coefficient from the first polynomial times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial. So, that would be 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, perhaps I'm supposed to consider that the second polynomial is multiplied as a whole, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just 6, and the rest is part of the coefficient in terms of c. But the problem doesn't specify any constraints on c, so maybe it's just asking for the coefficient in terms of a and b, regardless of c. So, in that case, the coefficient would indeed be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second part, which is 64, giving 384. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it and the answer is simply 6 because the second part doesn't affect the a and b terms. But that seems unlikely because when you multiply polynomials, each term is combined. So, I think the correct approach is that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the sum of the coefficients from the second part, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is found using the binomial coefficient \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).

So, in this case, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) can only come from multiplying \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first polynomial by any term from the second polynomial. But since the second polynomial only has terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), which are different variables, the variables \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) don't interact with \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean that the coefficient is an expression involving \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because coefficients are numerical. So, perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, ignoring the second part, which is multiplied by it. But that seems odd.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is written incorrectly, and it's supposed to be \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but the variables are different, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, and then the entire second part is just a scalar multiple. But that can't be right because \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is a polynomial in \\(c\\), not a scalar. So, perhaps the problem is expecting me to consider that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in the second polynomial. Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second polynomial, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times each coefficient in the second polynomial. But that would make the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) equal to 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 6 times \\(2^6 = 64\\), so 384. But I'm not sure if that's the right approach.\n\nWait, maybe I should think of it as the product of two independent polynomials. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient from the first polynomial times the entire second polynomial. But that would mean that the coefficient is a polynomial, not a number. So, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some \\(k\\), but it's only asking for \\(a^2b^2\\), so maybe the answer is 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems unlikely because the problem is asking for a coefficient, which is a number.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me check the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, perhaps the answer is simply 6, because the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6, and the second part doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. So, when you multiply by the second part, the coefficient remains 6, but the entire expression would have terms like \\(6a^2b^2 \\times \\text{(terms in c)}\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 times the entire second polynomial. But that can't be right because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable, so the coefficient would be 6 times each term in the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that's not a single number, so maybe the problem is miswritten, and it's supposed to be \\((a + b + c + 1/c)^{10}\\) or something like that. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only considering the coefficient in the first part, and the second part is just a scalar multiple, but that doesn't make sense because \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is a polynomial, not a scalar.\n\nWait, maybe I should consider that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, in the product, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is multiplied by every term in the second part. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that's not a single coefficient; it's an expression. So, perhaps the problem is expecting me to consider that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of the coefficients of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is found by setting \\(c = 1\\). So, the sum of coefficients is \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\), so 6 * 64 = 384. But I'm not sure if that's the right approach.\n\nWait, let me think differently. The problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. So, the coefficient would be the sum of all products of coefficients from the first polynomial and the second polynomial such that when multiplied together, the variables give \\(a^2b^2\\). But since the second polynomial only has variables \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), which don't interact with \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial times the entire second polynomial. So, the coefficient would be 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial, not a number. Therefore, perhaps the problem is expecting me to consider that the coefficient is 6, and the rest is separate, so the answer is 6. But that seems too simple, and I think the problem is expecting a numerical value.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is actually to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating \\(c\\) as a variable, but since \\(c\\) is separate, the coefficient would be 6 times each term in the second expansion. But that's not a single coefficient. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. That would make sense because then you have to find the term where \\(c\\) cancels out. So, let me try that approach.\n\nSo, if I consider the entire product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), and then multiply it by 6. So, first, let's find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(1/c\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, we need the exponent \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\). So, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire product is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, that makes sense. So, the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by \\(c^0\\), so the term where \\(c\\) cancels out. Therefore, the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120. So, the answer is 120. Let me verify this.\n\nFirst, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). In \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, when you multiply these two, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is 6 * 20 = 120. So, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without considering \\(c\\), then the answer would be 6, but that seems unlikely because the problem includes the second part. So, I think the correct approach is to consider that the coefficient is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by considering the expansion of each part separately and then combining the relevant coefficients.\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term with \\(a^2b^2\\) occurs when \\(k = 2\\), so the coefficient is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\n   \\]\n\n2. **Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n   \\]\n   To find the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero (\\(c^0\\)), set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\). The coefficient is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\n   \\]\n\n3. **Combine the coefficients:**\n   Since the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the product of the two coefficients:\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 20 = 120\n   \\]\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

    "text": " So, in this expansion, when does \\(a^2b^2\\) occur? That would be when \\(4 - k = 2\\), so \\(k = 2\\). So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Let me compute that: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, that part is clear. Now, the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Hmm, so the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product of two expressions: \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are variables, and \\(c\\) is another variable. So, when you multiply these two expressions together, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But the question is specifically about the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, I think that in the product, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and the other terms involve \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), which are different variables, I don't think they affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, no, that's not right. Actually, the entire expression is a product of two polynomials, so each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), we can consider the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part and multiply it by the entire second expression. But wait, no, that's not correct either because each term in the product would be \\(a^2b^2\\) times some term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). Wait, no, that's not possible because \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term on its own, and when multiplied by terms from the second expression, it would create terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2c^{-k}\\), but the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would only come from the term where the second part contributes a constant term, i.e., \\(c^0\\), because otherwise, the term would have \\(c\\) raised to some power, and we're only interested in the term where the power of \\(c\\) is zero. So, in other words, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me compute that. Using the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, we need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. That is, \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), so \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Let me compute that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the two coefficients: 6 (from \\((a + b)^4\\)) and 20 (from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)), so 6 \u00d7 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient is 120.\n\nWait, let me double-check that. So, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6. In \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\), which is 20. So, when I multiply these two, I get 6 \u00d7 20 = 120. So, yes, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120. I think that's correct.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression is found by considering each part separately. Using the binomial theorem, the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the constant term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20.

Wait, but I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\) at all. So, does that mean that the coefficient from the second part doesn't affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)? Hmm, maybe not. Wait, no, that can't be right because the entire expression is a product of two expansions. But since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is in the first part, and the second part is multiplied by it, perhaps the second part contributes a factor that affects the overall coefficient.

Wait, that doesn't sound right either.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\). The other part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), when expanded, will have terms involving different powers of \\(c\\), but since \\(a^2b^2\\) is independent of \\(c\\), perhaps the coefficient is just 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would make the coefficient a polynomial in \\(c\\), but the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, so that doesn't make sense. Hmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem.\n\nWait, let me reread the problem: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, perhaps the problem is considering the entire product, and it's asking for the coefficient of the term that has \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by some power of \\(c\\). But since the problem only specifies \\(a^2b^2\\), without any \\(c\\) terms, perhaps it's considering the coefficient when the product is expanded, and the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any possible power of \\(c\\). But that would mean that the coefficient would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that might not be the case.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), because each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But wait, the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is obtained by setting \\(c = 1\\), so substituting \\(c = 1\\) gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of all coefficients is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times 64, which is 384. But that seems high. Wait, is that correct?\n\nWait, let me think again. When you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each polynomial.

But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for any \\(k\\). So, perhaps the problem is only considering the term where \\(c\\) is raised to the zero power, so that \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by 1, so \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). Therefore, we need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), and then multiply that by 6.\n\nSo, let's compute the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\).

So, when \\(k = 3\\), the exponent is \\(6 - 6 = 0\\), so the term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}c^0 = 20\\). So, the coefficient is 20. Then, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6.

Because when you multiply the two expansions, the terms where the exponents of \\(c\\) add up to zero (i.e., \\(c^k \\times c^{-k}\\)) will contribute to the constant term, which is the term without \\(c\\). So, first, I found that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. Now, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Let me expand \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem as well. So, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(1/c\\right)^m\\). Simplifying each term, that's \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m} = \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We want the exponent of \\(c\\) to be zero, so we set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the term where \\(m = 3\\) is the constant term. The coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Let me calculate that. \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). Wait, that's not right. Wait, 6! is 720, and 3! is 6, so 6!/(3!3!) is 720/(6*6) which is 720/36, which is indeed 20. So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the second part), which is 6 * 20 = 120. Wait, so is that the final answer? Let me double-check. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 20. Multiplying them gives 6 * 20 = 120. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120. Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, I can think of it as each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) being multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), and since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), only the constant term in the second expansion will contribute. So, the total coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120. Yeah, that makes sense.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplying it by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20. Thus, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{120}\n\\]"

    "text": " So, I need to find the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) appears. That would be when the exponent on \\(a\\) is 2 and on \\(b\\) is 2. So, in the binomial expansion, \\(a^{4 - k}b^k\\), so when \\(4 - k = 2\\), that means \\(k = 2\\). So, the term is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} a^{2}b^{2}\\). Let me calculate that coefficient: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) is 6, because 4 choose 2 is 6. So, the coefficient from the first part is 6. Now, the original expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, after expanding \\((a + b)^4\\), I get terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and then I have this other part involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). But the problem is only asking about the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so I think I don't need to worry about the \\(c\\) terms because they don't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) exponents. Wait, is that right? Let me think again. The expression is a product of two expansions: one in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and another in \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, when I multiply them together, each term from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term from the second expansion. But since I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), any term from the second expansion will just multiply the coefficient from the first expansion, but the variables involved will be separate. So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression will be 6 times whatever the coefficient is for the term in the second expansion that doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), but I think that's not correct. Wait, no, actually, when you multiply two expressions together, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. But since the second expression is in terms of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), it doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), so when I'm looking for the term \\(a^2b^2\\), it's just the term from the first expansion multiplied by the entire second expansion. Wait, no, that doesn't make sense. Let me try to clarify. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but the entire expression is a product of two separate expansions: one in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and another in \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, when I expand the entire expression, each term in the first expansion (like \\(a^2b^2\\)) will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all terms in the second part. But that can't be right because that would make the coefficient a very large number, and I think the problem expects a specific coefficient, not a sum. Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, when you expand this, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But when looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), we need to find all terms in the product where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2 each, regardless of the exponents of \\(c\\). So, in other words, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by any term from the second expansion, it just adds a factor involving \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), but the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the sum of all the coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by the coefficient from the first part. Wait, no, that's not correct. Actually, each term in the product is of the form (term from first expansion) \u00d7 (term from second expansion). So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I need to consider all possible combinations where the first part contributes \\(a^2b^2\\) and the second part contributes any term. But since the second part is in terms of \\(c\\), which is separate from \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Wait, but that doesn't seem right because the second part isn't a constant; it's a sum of terms with different powers of \\(c\\). So, actually, when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, you get terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2c^{-k}\\), but the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) itself would be the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients from the second part. But the second part's coefficients are the coefficients of each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion would be when we set \\(c = 1\\), because substituting \\(c = 1\\) makes each term equal to its coefficient. So, let me calculate that. The sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is when \\(c = 1\\), so it becomes \\((1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, multiplied by 64, giving 6 \u00d7 64 = 384. Wait, but I'm not sure if that's correct. Let me think again. Alternatively, maybe I should consider that the second part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), when expanded, has terms like \\(c^6, 6c^4, 15c^2, 20, 15c^{-2}, 6c^{-4}, c^{-6}\\). So, each of these terms has a coefficient. When I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second part, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(6a^2b^2c^4\\), etc. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would only consider the terms where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2 each, regardless of the exponents of \\(c\\). However, since \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Because each term from the second part contributes its coefficient when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), so the total coefficient would be 6 \u00d7 (sum of coefficients in the second part). As I calculated before, the sum of coefficients in the second part is 64, so 6 \u00d7 64 = 384. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 384. But wait, let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. Another way to think about it is that when you have two independent variables, \\(a, b\\) and \\(c\\), the coefficient of a specific term in one set doesn't affect the other. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed the product of the coefficient from the first expansion and the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion. Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, each term's coefficient adds to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. So, yes, 6 \u00d7 64 = 384. Therefore, the coefficient is 384.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break down the problem as follows:\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term containing \\(a^2b^2\\) occurs when \\(k = 2\\):\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\n   \\]\n   So, the coefficient from the first part is 6.\n\n2. **Consider the second part \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   The sum of the coefficients in this expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\):\n   \\[\n   (1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\n   \\]\n\n3. **Combine the results:**\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficients from both parts:\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 64 = 384\n   \\]\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{384}\\)."

So, does the second part affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)? Hmm, let me think. When I multiply two polynomials, each term in the first polynomial gets multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient from the first part, 6, multiplied by the sum of all terms in the second part, because when you multiply by 1, it's just the same as the second part. Wait, no, that's not quite right. Because \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term from the first part, and when you multiply it by any term from the second part, it's going to be a term in the product. But the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not any other terms. So, actually, the second part doesn't affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) because \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\).

But when I multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term without \\(c\\), the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in the second expansion.

So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) can only come from the product of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and any term in the second part, which doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\). So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part.

So, I need to find the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). How do I find the sum of all coefficients in a polynomial? Well, the sum of coefficients is found by plugging in 1 for all variables. So, if I substitute \\(c = 1\\) into the second expression, I get \\(\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = (1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of all coefficients in the second part is 64.

So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the entire second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but since we're just looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\), maybe I don't need to consider the second part at all. Wait, that doesn't make sense because the second part is being multiplied by the first. So, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when you expand this, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) has a coefficient, and when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each of those terms, you're effectively scaling \\(a^2b^2\\) by the sum of all those coefficients. \n\nWait, but I'm not sure if that's the right approach. Let me think again. Maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\), and \\(1/c\\) are all separate variables, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will only come from the product of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and any term in the second part. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, that would mean the coefficient is 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial, not a number. That can't be right because the coefficient should be a number, not an expression. So, maybe I made a mistake in my reasoning.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). In that case, the coefficient would indeed be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because each term in the second expansion would multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term, and the coefficient would be the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. \n\nWait, but the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\). So, if I substitute \\(c = 1\\) into \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), I get \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times 64, which is 384. \n\nWait, but let me confirm that. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 384. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of it as the product of the two expressions, so each term in the first expression is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by every term in the second part. Since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, giving 384. \n\nWait, but another way to think about it is that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the entire second part, but since the second part is a polynomial in \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the entire second polynomial. But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, which doesn't make sense because coefficients should be scalars. So, perhaps the correct approach is that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 64, giving 384. \n\nWait, but let me check this with a smaller example to make sure I'm not making a mistake. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, expanding, \\((a + b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2\\), and \\((c + 1/c) = c + 1/c\\). So, the product is \\((a^2 + 2ab + b^2)(c + 1/c)\\). If I look for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but in this case, there is no \\(a^2b^2\\) term because the first polynomial only goes up to \\(b^2\\), and the second polynomial only has \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, perhaps in this case, the coefficient is zero. Wait, but in my earlier reasoning, the coefficient would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is zero, times the sum of coefficients in the second part, which is 2. So, zero times 2 is zero, which matches. \n\nAnother example: \\((a + b)^1 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). The coefficient of \\(a^1b^0\\) is 1, and the sum of coefficients in the second part is 2, so the coefficient would be 1 * 2 = 2. But looking at the product, it's \\((a + b)(c + 1/c) = a c + a/c + b c + b / c\\). There is no term with \\(a^1b^0\\) times a constant, but rather each term has either \\(a\\) or \\(b\\) multiplied by a term in \\(c\\). So, perhaps my initial approach is incorrect because the coefficients are not simply multiplied by the sum of the coefficients. Maybe I'm confusing the concept here.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think again. The problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product. Since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will only come from the product of the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in \\((a + b)^4\\) and any term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since we're just looking for the coefficient, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nBut wait, in the smaller example, when I had \\((a + b)^1 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\), the coefficient of \\(a^1b^0\\) would be 1 (from the first part) times the sum of coefficients in the second part, which is 2, giving 2. But in reality, the product is \\(a c + a / c + b c + b / c\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^1\\) is \\(c + 1/c\\), which is not a scalar. So, perhaps my initial approach is incorrect because the coefficient isn't a scalar in this case; it's a polynomial. Therefore, maybe the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the powers of \\(c\\), meaning that we're considering the entire product and looking for terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) appears, regardless of what power of \\(c\\) is attached. But that's not possible because each term in the product will have some combination of \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\), and \\(1/c\\). So, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some \\(k\\), but it's not specified. Wait, no, the problem just says the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), without mentioning \\(c\\), which suggests that we're to consider the coefficient in the context where \\(c\\) is treated as a separate variable, so the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\). But that seems odd because the problem is asking for a coefficient, which is typically a scalar. \n\nWait, maybe I misread the problem. Let me check again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)\". So, it's possible that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). In that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because each term in that expansion would multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. But that would make the coefficient a polynomial, not a scalar. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), meaning the constant term with respect to \\(c\\). That would make more sense because then the coefficient would be a scalar. \n\nIf that's the case, then I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product. So, first, find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), and then multiply those two coefficients together. \n\nSo, let's compute the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). \n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. \n\nNow, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, as we found earlier. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire product is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). \n\nWait, but earlier I thought the answer was 384, but that was under the assumption that we were considering the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which would give 64. But now, considering that we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), the answer is 120. \n\nI think I need to clarify what the problem is asking. The problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\". If it's in the context where \\(c\\) is a separate variable, then the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\), which would be 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems unlikely because coefficients are usually scalars. Alternatively, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it's 120. Alternatively, if it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then it's 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nWait, but let's see. In the original problem, it's written as \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when you expand this, each term in the product will have some combination of \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\), and \\(1/c\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), etc. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would actually be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the entire expansion of the second part. So, the coefficient would be 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial. \n\nBut the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which suggests that it's expecting a scalar. Therefore, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), the term where the exponents of \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are 2, 2, and 0 respectively. That would make sense because then the coefficient is a scalar. \n\nGiven that, let me proceed under that assumption. So, first, find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6. Then, find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20, as calculated earlier. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product is 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nWait, but let me confirm this with another approach. Alternatively, I can consider that the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). To find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), I can consider the product of the terms from each expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\) with coefficient 6, and the term \\(c^0\\) comes from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) with coefficient 20. Therefore, multiplying these together gives 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nAlternatively, if I were to expand the entire product, the term \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) would only come from the product of \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part and \\(c^0\\) from the second part, which is exactly what I did. \n\nTherefore, I think the correct answer is 120. \n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was 384, but that was under a different interpretation. So, I need to make sure which interpretation is correct. The problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\". If it's in the entire product, considering all variables, then the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\), which would be 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems unlikely because coefficients are scalars. Therefore, the problem is more likely asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), meaning that we're to sum over all possible powers of \\(c\\). But that would mean the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. But that would result in the coefficient being 384, which is a scalar. \n\nWait, but in the context of polynomials, when you have multiple variables, the coefficient of a specific term like \\(a^2b^2\\) would indeed include all possible coefficients from the other variables. So, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), which would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. \n\nBut let me think about this carefully. If I have two polynomials, say \\(P(a, b) = (a + b)^4\\) and \\(Q(c) = \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), then their product is \\(P(a, b) \\times Q(c)\\). So, each term in \\(P(a, b)\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(Q(c)\\). Therefore, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(P(a, b)\\) will be multiplied by each term in \\(Q(c)\\), resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), etc. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(P(a, b)\\) multiplied by the entire polynomial \\(Q(c)\\). Therefore, the coefficient is 6 times \\(Q(c)\\), which is 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nBut the problem is asking for a coefficient, which is a scalar. Therefore, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is a specific term. In that case, the coefficient is 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(Q(c)\\), which is 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), which would mean summing over all coefficients of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for any \\(k\\). But that would result in 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(Q(c)\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nI think the key here is to interpret the problem correctly. If the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, then the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\), specifically 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since the problem is asking for a coefficient, which is a scalar, it's more likely that it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is written in such a way that \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are all variables, and the coefficient is a scalar. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nWait, but let's see. If I consider the entire product, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial. But the problem is asking for a coefficient, which is a scalar, so that can't be right. Therefore, I think the correct interpretation is that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. \n\nTo confirm, let me think about how the product would look. The first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), expands to \\(a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). The second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), expands to \\(c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15/c^2 + 6/c^4 + 1/c^6\\). So, when you multiply these two expansions, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, resulting in \\(6a^2b^2c^6 + 6a^2b^2c^4 + 90a^2b^2c^2 + 120a^2b^2 + 90a^2b^2/c^2 + 6a^2b^2/c^4 + 6a^2b^2/c^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is 120, while the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, regardless of the power of \\(c\\), would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nBut the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). So, if we're considering the entire product, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial. However, since the problem is asking for a coefficient, which is a scalar, it's more plausible that the intended answer is 120, assuming that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is written in a way that \\(c\\) is a constant, but that seems unlikely because \\(c\\) is a variable. Therefore, I think the most reasonable interpretation is that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. \n\nWait, but let me check the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)\". The problem doesn't specify anything about \\(c\\), so perhaps it's intended to treat \\(c\\) as a separate variable, and the coefficient is a polynomial. But in that case, the answer would be 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial, not a scalar. Therefore, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, regardless of the power of \\(c\\), which would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nBut then, in that case, the coefficient is a scalar, which makes sense. So, perhaps that's the intended answer. \n\nWait, but in the expansion, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), etc. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 times the entire second expansion. But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, which doesn't make sense because coefficients are scalars. Therefore, the problem must be asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. \n\nI think I've gone in circles here. To resolve this, perhaps I can look at the problem from another angle. If the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nAlternatively, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it's 120. \n\nGiven that the problem is stated as it is, without specifying anything about \\(c\\), I think the most plausible interpretation is that it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable, which would be 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since the answer is expected to be a scalar, perhaps the intended interpretation is that we're to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is written such that \\(c\\) is a constant, but that seems unlikely because it's presented as a variable. \n\nGiven the ambiguity, but considering that the problem is asking for a coefficient, which is a scalar, I think the intended answer is 120. Therefore, I will go with 120 as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. \n\nWait, but earlier I thought that the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion is 64, which is when \\(c = 1\\). So, if I substitute \\(c = 1\\) into \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), I get \\(2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the sum of all coefficients is 64. So, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), then it's 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nBut in that case, the coefficient would be 384, which is a scalar. So, perhaps that's the intended answer. \n\nWait, let me think again. If I have \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), and I want the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), then in the context of the entire expression, \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term that is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the entire second expansion. But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, which doesn't make sense because coefficients are scalars. Therefore, the problem must be asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is written in a way that \\(c\\) is a constant, but that seems unlikely. \n\nI think I've spent enough time thinking about this. Given the problem as stated, I think the intended answer is 120, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). So, I'll go with that.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break the problem into two parts:\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term with \\(a^2b^2\\) occurs when \\(k = 2\\):\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} a^{2}b^{2} = 6a^2b^2\n   \\]\n   So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\n2. **Find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n   \\]\n   We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0:\n   \\[\n   6 - 2k = 0 \\implies k = 3\n   \\]\n   The coefficient is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\n   \\]\n\n3. **Multiply the coefficients from both parts:**\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product is:\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 20 = 120\n   \\]\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}."

So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Let me compute that: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient is 6.

But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is in the first part, right? Because the second part involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), which are different variables.

The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, when we expand this, each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), the coefficient will remain as it is in \\((a + b)^4\\). So, the coefficient is 6. Wait, but let me make sure. Let me consider that when we multiply two polynomials, the coefficients multiply. But in this case, the terms from the second polynomial are in terms of \\(c\\), so when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), they become \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some \\(k\\). So, unless \\(c^k\\) is 1, which would require \\(k=0\\), but in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the constant term (where \\(k=0\\)) is the middle term, which is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}c^3 \\times (1/c)^3 = \\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, when we multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by this constant term, we get \\(20a^2b^2\\). Wait, that means the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 multiplied by 20, which is 120? Wait, that contradicts my earlier thought. So, maybe I was wrong before. Let me clarify. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). When we expand this, each term from \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term from the second part. But we are only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, actually, every term in the expansion that has \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by any power of \\(c\\) will contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). But wait, no, because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a specific term. So, perhaps the term \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by the constant term from the second expansion, which is 20, as I calculated. So, the coefficient would be 6 times 20, which is 120. Alternatively, if the problem had asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some \\(k\\), then it would be different, but since it's just \\(a^2b^2\\), I think it's 6 times the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion that don't involve \\(c\\). Wait, no, that's not right. Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by any term from the second expansion, it will be \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^k\\) or \\(1/c^k\\). So, the only way to get a term that is just \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) is if we multiply by the constant term from the second expansion, which is when \\(k=0\\), which is 20. So, the coefficient is 6 times 20, which is 120. Wait, but earlier I thought it was just 6, but now I'm thinking it's 120. Which is correct? Let me think again. Let me write it out more formally. Let me denote the first part as \\(A = (a + b)^4\\) and the second part as \\(B = \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the product is \\(A \\times B\\). We need the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(A \\times B\\). Now, in \\(A\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, as we found. In \\(B\\), the expansion is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\times (1/c)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, the terms in \\(B\\) are \\(c^6, 6c^4, 15c^2, 20, 15c^{-2}, 6c^{-4}, c^{-6}\\). So, when we multiply \\(A\\) and \\(B\\), each term in \\(A\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(B\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(A\\) will be multiplied by each term in \\(B\\), resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6, a^2b^2c^4, \\dots, a^2b^2c^{-6}\\). However, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is the term where the power of \\(c\\) is zero, i.e., the constant term from \\(B\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(A\\) multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(B\\). The coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(B\\) is 20, as we saw. So, the total coefficient is 6 times 20, which is 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120. Wait, but I'm a bit confused because earlier I thought it was just 6, but now I'm seeing it's 120. Let me check this again. Let me consider that when you have two polynomials multiplied together, the coefficient of a specific term is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each polynomial. But in this case, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(A\\) is being multiplied by every term in \\(B\\), but only the constant term in \\(B\\) will result in a term that is just \\(a^2b^2\\). All other terms will have a power of \\(c\\), which we don't want. So, only the constant term in \\(B\\) contributes to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient is indeed 6 times 20, which is 120. Alternatively, if the problem had asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some \\(k\\), then we would have to consider all possible terms, but since it's just \\(a^2b^2\\), we only consider the term where the power of \\(c\\) is zero. Therefore, the coefficient is 120. I think that's the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Next, we consider the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying these coefficients together gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\boxed{120}."

    "text": " That means I need the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2. So, in the expansion, that would correspond to \\(k = 2\\) because \\(4 - k = 2\\) implies \\(k = 2\\). So, the coefficient there would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Let me calculate that. \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) is \\(\\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. \n\nBut wait, the original expression isn't just \\((a + b)^4\\); it's multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I need to consider both parts together. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but since the second part of the expression involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), which don't affect \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), maybe the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just the same as the coefficient in \\((a + b)^4\\), multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, no, that doesn't seem right because when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first polynomial gets multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. But since the second polynomial is in terms of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), which don't interact with \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), the coefficients of \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nWait, is that correct? Let me think again. When you have \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the expansion of the first will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part will be multiplied by every term in the second part. But since we are only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), it means that the coefficient will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, the only way \\(a^2b^2\\) remains is if it's multiplied by a term that doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\). So, essentially, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nWait, but is that accurate? Let me test it with a simpler case. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^1 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, the coefficient of \\(a^1b^0\\) would be 1 (from \\((a + b)^1\\)) multiplied by the sum of coefficients in \\((c + 1/c)^1\\), which is \\(1 + 1 = 2\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^1b^0c^0\\) would be 1 * 2 = 2. But actually, when you expand \\((a + b)(c + 1/c)\\), the term \\(a \\times c\\) is \\(ac\\), \\(a \\times 1/c\\) is \\(a/c\\), \\(b \\times c\\) is \\(bc\\), and \\(b \\times 1/c\\) is \\(b/c\\). So, the terms involving \\(a\\) or \\(b\\) without \\(c\\) are zero. Hmm, so in that case, the coefficient of \\(a^1b^0\\) is actually zero because there's no term without \\(c\\). Wait, so my initial thought was wrong. So, maybe I need a different approach.\n\nWait, so perhaps I should consider that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by \\(c^0\\), you get \\(a^2b^2\\), which is the term we're interested in. So, that makes sense. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part. That seems correct because when you multiply, you're combining the coefficients of the same powers.\n\nSo, first, let me find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which I already calculated as 6. Now, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). To find that, I can use the binomial theorem again. Let's expand \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem, this is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(1/c\\right)^k\\). Simplifying the exponents, each term becomes \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} c^{-k} = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20.\n\nNow, since the two parts are multiplied together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the two coefficients we found. So, that's 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the second part). Let me compute that: 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 120.\n\nWait, let me just double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake. First, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Then, in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying these together gives 120, which seems correct. I don't see any errors in my reasoning now. So, I think the answer is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Multiplying these gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\boxed{120}"

Now, the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Hmm, so I think I need to consider the expansion of this part as well.

The second part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which involves variables \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), so maybe when I multiply these two parts together, the terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) will affect the overall expression.

Wait, no, that can't be right because the second expansion might have terms that cancel out or combine in a way that affects the overall coefficient. Wait, actually, maybe not. Let me think again. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the first part, and when I multiply it by the entire expansion of the second part, it's like \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, no, that's not correct because the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) would be when \\(c = 1\\), right? Because substituting \\(c = 1\\) gives the sum of coefficients. So, \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 * 64 = 384. Wait, but I'm not sure if that's the case. Let me check again. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Since we're only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), then when we multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is of the form \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the coefficient for each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\), and the exponent of \\(c\\) is \\(6 - 2m\\). Now, since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), that would require the exponent of \\(c\\) to be zero, right? So, \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(m = 3\\). So, the term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) that has \\(c^0\\) is when \\(m = 3\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, the term is 20.

But that can't be right because that would mean the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which would be a huge number. Wait, no, that's not correct. Let me think again. When you multiply two expressions, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each expression. But in this case, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the first expression, so in the product, it's \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by each term in the second expansion.

So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nWait, but let me make sure. The sum of the coefficients in a polynomial is found by plugging in 1 for all variables. So, for \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the sum of coefficients would be when \\(c = 1\\). Let's compute that: \\(\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = (2)^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of the coefficients in the second part is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 times 64, which is 384. Wait, but that seems high. Let me check my reasoning again.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Since the second part doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).

Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\).\n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20.\n\nNow, multiplying the two coefficients together: 6 (from \\(a^2b^2\\)) times 20 (from \\(c^0\\)) equals 120.\n\nWait, so that means the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120. Hmm, that makes sense because when you multiply the two expansions, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by the constant term (c^0) from the second part, and that gives the term \\(a^2b^2\\), whose coefficient is 6 times 20, which is 120.\n\nLet me just double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake. First, I found the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) correctly as 6. Then, I realized that to get the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, it must be multiplied by the term \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion, so I found the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 20. Multiplying 6 and 20 gives 120. That seems right.\n\nAlternatively, I could think of the entire product as \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). When expanding this, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first expansion, and to get the overall term \\(a^2b^2\\), we need to multiply it by the term in the second expansion that has \\(c^0\\), which is 20. So, 6 times 20 is 120. Yeah, that checks out.\n\nI think I might have confused myself earlier by considering the sum of all coefficients, but that's not necessary here because we only need the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is tied to the constant term in the second expansion. So, the final answer should be 120.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break the problem into two parts:\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term with \\(a^2b^2\\) occurs when \\(k = 2\\):\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} a^{2}b^{2} = 6a^2b^2\n   \\]\n   So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\n2. **Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n   \\]\n   We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0:\n   \\[\n   6 - 2k = 0 \\implies k = 3\n   \\]\n   The coefficient is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\n   \\]\n\n3. **Multiply the coefficients:**\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the product of the coefficients from both expansions:\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 20 = 120\n   \\]\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

Wait, no, that doesn't seem right. Let me think again. Actually, when you multiply two polynomials together, the coefficients multiply as well.

Because when you multiply, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in the other polynomial, so the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial. So, I need to find the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). How do I find the sum of coefficients in a polynomial? Well, the sum of coefficients is found by setting all variables to 1. So, if I substitute \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) becomes \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\).

The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which comes only from the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\). The second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), when expanded, will have terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), but since we're only looking for \\(a^2b^2\\), the \\(c\\) terms don't affect that.

Wait, but that doesn't make sense because when you multiply, each term from the first expansion is multiplied by each term from the second, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would actually be 6 times the sum of all terms in the second expansion.

But that seems too simple.\n\nWait, no, perhaps the question is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), without considering the \\(c\\) terms. So, maybe the answer is just 6, and the second part doesn't affect it because it's multiplied by other terms involving \\(c\\). But I'm not sure. Let me check again.\n\nWait, no, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When you multiply these two expansions together, each term from the first expansion is multiplied by each term from the second. So, for the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, when you multiply it by each term in the second expansion, you get terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) and \\(a^2b^2c^{-k}\\) for various \\(k\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would actually be the coefficient from the first part, 6, multiplied by the entire second expansion. But that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. But wait, the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion is when you set \\(c = 1\\), so \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). So, the coefficient would be 6 * 64 = 384. But that seems too large, and I'm not sure if that's correct because the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not considering \\(c\\) terms. So, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, in that case, the coefficient would just be 6, because the \\(c\\) part doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) exponents. So, when you multiply, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of all terms in the second expansion, but that's not correct because the sum of all terms would change the coefficient. Wait, no, actually, each term in the second expansion is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, making it 384. But that seems too high, and I'm not sure if that's what the problem is asking for.\n\nWait, let me read the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term in the product. So, in the product, each term is a product of a term from the first expansion and a term from the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first expansion, and it's multiplied by each term from the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the entire expansion of the second part. But that would mean that the coefficient is 6 * \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial in \\(c\\), but the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, not a polynomial. So, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which would just be 6. But that seems too simple, so maybe I'm missing something.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is considering the entire expression and wants the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms. So, that would mean that we're looking for the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\), i.e., the constant term in the second expansion. So, in that case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). That makes more sense. So, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nOkay, so let's work on that. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) can be done using the binomial theorem as well. So, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 * 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\).\n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the second part), which equals 120. So, the coefficient is 120.\n\nWait, let me verify that again. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first expansion with coefficient 6, and we need the term in the second expansion that doesn't change the exponent of \\(c\\), which is the constant term, which we found to be 20. So, when we multiply these, the coefficient becomes 6 * 20 = 120. That seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, if I think about the entire product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term from the second expansion. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which implies that we're considering all terms in the product where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present, regardless of the \\(c\\) exponents. But in reality, each term in the product will have both \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) exponents and \\(c\\) exponents. So, if the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), without any restrictions on \\(c\\), then the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of the second part, which is a polynomial. But that's not a numerical coefficient; it's a polynomial in \\(c\\). So, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some \\(k\\), but it's not specified. Alternatively, maybe the problem is only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. But that seems too high, and I'm not sure if that's what's intended.\n\nWait, but in the problem statement, it's written as \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, which would include all possible \\(c\\) exponents. So, in that case, the coefficient would indeed be 6 times the entire second expansion, which is a polynomial. But that's not a single number, so perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be 6 * 20 = 120, as I thought earlier.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is written incorrectly, and it's supposed to be \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) and we're supposed to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be 120. Alternatively, if it's just \\(a^2b^2\\) without considering \\(c\\), then the coefficient is 6. But given that the problem includes both parts, I think it's more likely that it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which would be 6 times the entire second expansion, but that's not a numerical value. So, perhaps the intended answer is 120, considering only the constant term in the second expansion.\n\nLet me check again. If I expand \\((a + b)^4\\), I get terms with \\(a^4, a^3b, a^2b^2, ab^3, b^4\\). The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. Then, when I multiply by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each of these terms is multiplied by each term in that expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial. So, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), without any restriction on \\(c\\), then it's 6 times that polynomial. But if it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it's 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nGiven that the problem is stated as it is, perhaps the intended answer is 120, considering only the constant term in the second expansion. So, I think the coefficient is 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break down the problem into two parts using the binomial theorem.\n\n1. **Expanding \\((a + b)^4\\):**\n   Using the binomial theorem, we have:\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\), so the coefficient is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\n   \\]\n\n2. **Expanding \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   Using the binomial theorem, we have:\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n   \\]\n   We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, which occurs when \\(6 - 2k = 0\\).

Wait, is that correct? Let me think again. So, if I have \\(6a^2b^2\\) multiplied by, say, \\(c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15c^{-2} + 6c^{-4} + c^{-6}\\), then each of these terms when multiplied by \\(6a^2b^2\\) will give me \\(6a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(36a^2b^2c^4\\), etc. So, in each of these, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the coefficient of the corresponding \\(c\\) term. But wait, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression. But in the entire expression, \\(a^2b^2\\) can be multiplied by any power of \\(c\\), including \\(c^0\\), which is 1. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because each term in the second expansion contributes a coefficient that gets multiplied by 6, and when you collect all the terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present, you'd have 6 times each of those coefficients. Wait, but that can't be right because the question is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not considering the \\(c\\) terms. So, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Maybe the question is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a single coefficient. Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" Hmm, perhaps the problem is treating \\(c\\) as another variable, so the entire expression is a product of two polynomials, one in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the other in \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, when you multiply them, each term will have powers of \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in other words, we need to find all terms in the product where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are exactly 2, and sum their coefficients, considering all possible exponents of \\(c\\). So, that would mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(6\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because each term in the second expansion contributes a coefficient that gets multiplied by 6, and all those terms will have \\(a^2b^2\\) as a factor. So, the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). Wait, is that correct? Let me check. Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just 6, and the other part doesn't affect it because \\(c\\) is another variable. But that doesn't make sense because when you multiply, the coefficients from the second part would multiply the 6. So, maybe I was right the first time. Let me think again: the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it, and the answer is just 6, but that seems unlikely because the second part is raised to the 6th power, so it's contributing a factor that affects the overall coefficient. Let me try another approach. Let's expand both parts separately and then see how they multiply. So, first, \\((a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. Now, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) can be expanded using the binomial theorem as \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, the expansion will have terms with exponents of \\(c\\) ranging from 6 down to -6, in steps of 2. Now, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by every term in the second part, resulting in terms like \\(6a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(6a^2b^2c^4\\), etc. So, in the entire product, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients in the second expansion, because each term in the second expansion contributes a coefficient that gets multiplied by 6. The sum of the coefficients in the second expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). Wait, but let me confirm that. Alternatively, maybe I'm supposed to consider that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just 6, and the other part doesn't affect it because we're only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\). But that doesn't make sense because the second part is a separate polynomial, so when you multiply, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would indeed be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second part. So, I think 384 is correct. Let me check with a smaller exponent to see if this approach works. Suppose instead of 4 and 6, we had exponents 1 and 1, so \\((a + b)^1 (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, the expansion would be \\((a + b)(c + 1/c)\\). The coefficient of \\(a^1b^0\\) is 1, and the sum of coefficients in the second part is \\(1 + 1 = 2\\), so the coefficient of \\(a\\) would be 1 * 2 = 2. Indeed, expanding \\((a + b)(c + 1/c)\\) gives \\(ac + a/c + bc + b/c\\). The coefficient of \\(a\\) is 2, which matches. So, applying the same logic, in the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 * 64 = 384. So, I think that's the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6. Then, the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is calculated by setting \\(c = 1\\), yielding \\(2^6 = 64\\). Multiplying these results gives the final coefficient.\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\boxed{384}."

Now, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient I'm looking for is just 6 times the coefficient of the corresponding term in the second part, but wait, actually, no. Wait a second, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product. But the second part of the expression is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which only involves c and 1/c, so when you multiply it by \\((a + b)^4\\), the variables a and b are only in the first part, and c is only in the second part. So, when you multiply the two expansions together, the terms involving a and b will come from the first part, and the terms involving c will come from the second part.

Wait, no, that can't be right because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is in the first part, and the second part is being multiplied by it. But actually, when you multiply two expressions together, each term in the first expression is multiplied by each term in the second expression. But since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term from the first expression, and the second expression involves c, which doesn't interact with a or b, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the entire expansion of the second part. But wait, that doesn't make sense because the second part is a separate variable. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that's not correct either because the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of what's happening with c. Wait, but in the product, each term from \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is multiplied by every term in the second part. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems off because the problem is probably expecting a numerical coefficient, not something involving c. Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, in the entire product, we have terms involving a, b, and c. But the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by terms involving c. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because \\(c^0\\) is the term that doesn't change the power of c. So, that makes sense because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by \\(c^0\\), you get \\(a^2b^2\\), which is the term we're interested in. So, the coefficient would be 6 (from the first part) times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part. So, now I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me think about how to do that. The expression \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) can be expanded using the binomial theorem as well. So, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k\\). Simplifying that, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\cdot c^{-k} = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We need the term where the exponent of c is 0, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for k, \\(6 = 2k\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Now, going back to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 (from the first part) times 20 (from the second part), which is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). So, the coefficient is 120. Wait, but let me double-check to make sure I didn't make a mistake. So, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). In \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term with \\(c^0\\) occurs when \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), so \\(k = 3\\), and the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying 6 and 20 gives 120. That seems correct. I don't think I made any errors in the calculations.

Wait, but the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, does that mean that the other part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), doesn't affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)? Hmm, maybe not. Because \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are variables separate from \\(c\\), so when we multiply out the two expressions, the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) won't interact with the terms involving \\(c\\).

But wait, no, that can't be right because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would be a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\). Wait, no, actually, when you multiply two expressions, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I need to find all the terms in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) that are multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). But since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term in \\((a + b)^4\\), and when you multiply by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) and \\(a^2b^2c^{-k}\\) for various exponents \\(k\\). But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would be the sum of all the coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) multiplied by 6. Wait, no, that's not correct because \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term in the first part, and when you multiply by the second part, you get terms that include both \\(a^2b^2\\) and some power of \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would mean the term where the power of \\(c\\) is zero, because \\(a^2b^2\\) is just the term without any \\(c\\) dependence. So, perhaps I need to find the term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) that has \\(c^0\\), because when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), that would give me a term with just \\(a^2b^2\\). So, first, let me find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, we need the exponent where \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), \\(6 - 2m = 0\\) gives \\(m = 3\\). So, the term where \\(m = 3\\) is the constant term. The coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Let me compute that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 * 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Therefore, when we multiply the two expressions, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by 20 from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), giving a term \\(20a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 20 * 6 = 120? Wait, no, wait. Wait, no, because the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the coefficient from the other part is 20, so when you multiply them together, the coefficient becomes 6 * 20 = 120. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120. Hmm, but let me double-check. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Since the two parts are multiplied together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the product of the coefficients from each part, provided that the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out to zero.

But wait, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). That means I need to consider all the terms in the second expansion and see if they affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, no, because \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\). So, actually, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is independent of \\(c\\). So, when I multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients in the second expansion. Because each term in the second expansion is a coefficient times a power of \\(c\\), but since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), it's just the sum of all the coefficients in the second expansion. So, the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\). Because when \\(c = 1\\), each term becomes just its coefficient. So, plugging \\(c = 1\\) into \\(\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = (2)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion is 64. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). Wait, is that correct? Let me double-check. So, the first part gives me 6 for \\(a^2b^2\\), and the second part, when expanded, has all terms multiplied by coefficients. Since \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each of these terms, the total coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion. The sum of the coefficients is indeed 64, as when \\(c = 1\\), the expression becomes 2^6 = 64. So, 6 * 64 is 384. Hmm, that seems right. Alternatively, maybe I should think about it differently. Let me consider the entire expression as the product of two expansions: \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When I multiply them together, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), the terms from the second expansion that involve \\(c\\) will just tag along, but since we're only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, the coefficient will be the product of the coefficient from the first expansion and the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion. Because each term in the second expansion is a coefficient times \\(c^k\\) or \\(c^{-k}\\), but when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), it becomes \\(a^2b^2\\) times a coefficient times \\(c^k\\) or \\(c^{-k}\\). However, since we're only interested in the term where the variables are \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, the coefficient would just be the product of the coefficients from each part. Therefore, the coefficient is indeed 6 * 64 = 384. So, I think that's the answer.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression is found by expanding each part separately. Using the binomial theorem, the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). The sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), resulting in \\(2^6 = 64\\). Multiplying these gives \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{384}"

    "text": " So, that would correspond to the term where \\(a\\) is squared and \\(b\\) is squared. So, \\(4 - k = 2\\) for \\(a\\), so \\(k = 2\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Let me compute that: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. \n\nBut wait, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I also have this second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Hmm, does this affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)? Let me think. Since the terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) are being multiplied by the terms from \\((a + b)^4\\), but the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, does that mean I just need to consider the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) and then multiply it by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)? Or do I need to consider something else?\n\nWait, actually, when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first polynomial gets multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), that term will be multiplied by every term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, that doesn't seem right because each term in the second expansion might have different powers of \\(c\\), but since we're only concerned with the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, perhaps the coefficient is just 6 times the sum of the coefficients of all terms in the second expansion.\n\nBut wait, the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) would be obtained by setting \\(c = 1\\). Let me check that: if \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of the coefficients is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nBut hold on, is that correct? Let me think again. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in other words, when you multiply the two expressions together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by every term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), so the coefficient will indeed be 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second expression, which is 64. So, 6 * 64 is 384. That seems high, but maybe that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me approach it differently. Since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\), and then multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients from the second part. Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, each term contributes to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times that term's coefficient.\n\nSo, yes, the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is indeed 64, as I calculated before. So, 6 * 64 is 384. Therefore, the coefficient is 384. Hmm, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the binomial coefficient.\n\nWait, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\\). So that's correct. Then, when multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which expands to terms like \\(c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15c^{-2} + 6c^{-4} + c^{-6}\\), right? So, each of these terms will be multiplied by 6, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) will be 6 times each of these coefficients, but since the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), it's just 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64. So, 6 * 64 is indeed 384.\n\nWait, but another thought: when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficients multiply term by term, but in this case, we're looking for the coefficient of a specific term in one part and any term in the other part. So, perhaps it's correct that the coefficient is 6 * 64. Alternatively, maybe I should consider that the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, so the coefficient would be 6 times each term's coefficient in the second expansion, but since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, it's just 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. So, yes, 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me check if the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is indeed 64. Let me compute it by substituting \\(c = 1\\), as I did before: \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). Yes, that's correct. So, the sum of all coefficients is 64, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but another way to think about it: when you have two independent variables, \\(a, b\\) and \\(c, 1/c\\), the terms in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from those in \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Because each term in the second part is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), so the total coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of the entire expression as a product, and the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the product of the coefficients from each part, but considering that the second part contributes a sum of coefficients. So, yes, 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me try another approach to verify. Let me expand both parts separately and see how the terms combine. So, \\((a + b)^4\\) expands to \\(a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, as I found before.\n\nNow, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) expands using the binomial theorem as \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, the coefficients are \\(\\dbinom{6}{0}=1\\), \\(\\dbinom{6}{1}=6\\), \\(\\dbinom{6}{2}=15\\), \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}=20\\), and then it decreases symmetrically: 15, 6, 1 for the higher powers of \\(1/c\\).\n\nSo, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second part, which has coefficients 1, 6, 15, 20, 15, 6, 1. So, the total contribution to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(6 \\times (1 + 6 + 15 + 20 + 15 + 6 + 1)\\). Let me compute that sum inside the parentheses: 1 + 6 is 7, plus 15 is 22, plus 20 is 42, plus 15 is 57, plus 6 is 63, plus 1 is 64. So, the sum is 64, as before. Therefore, 6 * 64 is 384. So, that confirms it again.\n\nWait, but just to make sure I'm not missing anything, is there a possibility that when multiplying \\(a^2b^2\\) by terms involving \\(c\\), it affects the coefficient? But no, because the coefficient is just a numerical factor; the variables \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), so their coefficients don't interfere. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just the product of the coefficient from the first part and the sum of all coefficients from the second part.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem had asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some specific \\(k\\), then I would have to find the corresponding term in the second expansion. But since it's just \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\), the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which is 64. So, 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me check my math again. 6 * 64: 6*60 is 360, plus 6*4 is 24, so 360 + 24 = 384. Yes, that's correct.\n\nSo, I think I'm confident that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is 384.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{384}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem.\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\):\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\n   \\]\n   So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\n2. **Consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n   \\]\n   The sum of the coefficients in this expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\):\n   \\[\n   \\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\n   \\]\n\n3. **Combine the results:**\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) and the sum of the coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 64 = 384\n   \\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{384}\\)."

    "text": " So, in this expansion, the term with \\(a^2b^2\\) would be when \\(4 - k = 2\\) for \\(a\\), which means \\(k = 2\\). So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Let me compute that: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient is 6. Now, the second part of the original expression is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Hmm, I notice that this part involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), so when multiplied by the first part, which is in terms of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), the \\(c\\) terms might not affect the \\(a^2b^2\\) term directly because they are different variables. So, maybe I don't need to worry about the \\(c\\) terms when looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, is that right? Let me think. The expression is a product of two separate binomial expansions: one in terms of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the other in terms of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, when I multiply them together, each term from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term from the second expansion. But since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are different variables, the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) won't interact with those involving \\(c\\). That means, when looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I can consider only the part of the expression that comes from \\((a + b)^4\\), because the \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) part will contribute a factor that's multiplied by each term, but since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient from the \\(c\\) part will just be 1 when considering only the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. Wait, no, that might not be accurate. Let me correct that. Actually, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in the expansion will be a product of a term from \\((a + b)^4\\) and a term from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, for example, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term from the second part, which are in terms of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term without any \\(c\\) (since it's just \\(a^2b^2\\)), that means we need to find the term where the \\(c\\) terms cancel out, i.e., the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Because when we multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by the constant term in the second expansion, we get a term that is just \\(a^2b^2\\) times that constant, which is the coefficient we're looking for. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Therefore, I need to compute both parts. First, as I did earlier, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. Now, I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Let's expand that using the binomial theorem. So, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(1/c\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m} = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero because that's the constant term. So, set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(6 = 2m\\) so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 * 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the two coefficients: 6 (from the first part) times 20 (from the second part). So, 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient is 120. Wait, but let me double-check that. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6, and the constant term in the second part is 20. So, when you multiply these two parts together, each term in the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by the constant term 20 from the second part, giving \\(20a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient is indeed 20 * 6 = 120. Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, I can think of the entire expression as the product of two independent expansions, so the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part. So, yes, 6 * 20 = 120.

The coefficient here is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). I remember that \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient from the \\((a + b)^4\\) part is 6.

But that doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a coefficient, not an expression. Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all the coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).

Alternatively, maybe the question is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), regardless of the other terms involving \\(c\\). But that can't be, because the problem includes the entire expression. Wait, perhaps I need to consider that the entire expression is a product of two expansions, so when I multiply them, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, no, because when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. But since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) because any term in the second expansion, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), would contribute to the coefficient. But that seems a bit confusing. Alternatively, maybe the question is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), and the second part is just multiplied along, so the coefficient would be 6 times whatever the sum of coefficients in the second part is. But that doesn't seem right because the second part might have terms that could affect the coefficient. Wait, no, because \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term in the first part, and when you multiply by the second part, each term in the second part will be multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so maybe it's 6 times the sum of the coefficients of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me think about that. The sum of the coefficients in a polynomial is found by setting all variables to 1. So, if I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of the coefficients in the second part is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 * 64 = 384. Wait, but that seems too straightforward. Let me check again. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, maybe I should consider that when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by every term in the second expansion, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient from the first part times the sum of coefficients from the second part, which is 6 * 64 = 384. But I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, maybe the problem is expecting just the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and the second part is just a distraction. But that seems unlikely because the problem includes both parts. Wait, another approach: perhaps the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), and when expanding, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be present in the first part, and multiplied by each term in the second part. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). As I calculated earlier, that sum is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. Therefore, the coefficient is 384. Let me see if that makes sense. Alternatively, maybe the problem is only considering the coefficient in the first part, but I think that's not the case. The problem says \"in \\((a + b)^4 \\times (c + 1/c)^6\\)\", so it's looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product. Therefore, I think the correct approach is to take the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, and multiply it by the sum of coefficients from the second part, which is 64, giving 384. So, I think the answer is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is found by first determining the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem, which is 6. Next, the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is calculated by setting \\(c = 1\\), resulting in \\(2^6 = 64\\). Multiplying these together gives \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n\\boxed{384}"

    "text": " So, I need to find the term where the exponents of a and b are both 2. That would be when \\(4 - k = 2\\) for a, which means \\(k = 2\\). So, the term would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} a^{2}b^{2}\\). Let me calculate \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). That's 4! / (2! * (4 - 2)!) = (24)/(2 * 2) = 24/4 = 6. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. \n\nBut wait, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I need to consider the expansion of both parts. However, the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and it doesn't mention anything about c or \\(1/c\\). That makes me think that maybe the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by some term from the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), perhaps it's just the coefficient from the first part, regardless of the second part? Hmm, that doesn't seem right because the entire expression is the product of both expansions. Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Let me think again.\n\nWait, no. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression. That means I need to consider all terms in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) and find the coefficient of the term where the exponents of a and b are both 2. But in the entire product, each term from \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by every term from the second part. However, the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which implies that we're considering the term \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by any combination of c and \\(1/c\\). But since the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of c, perhaps we can treat the second part as a constant with respect to a and b? Wait, that might not be correct because the second part is a separate variable. Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating this.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, but since the product includes terms with c and \\(1/c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 6 times \\(2^6 = 64\\), so 6 * 64 = 384. But wait, that seems too high. Alternatively, maybe I'm supposed to consider that the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any term from the second part, but since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), perhaps it's just the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, and the second part doesn't affect it because we're treating a and b separately. Hmm, I'm confused.\n\nWait, let me think differently. The expression is a product of two separate binomials. So, when you expand \\((a + b)^4\\), you get terms like \\(a^4\\), \\(a^3b\\), \\(a^2b^2\\), etc., and when you expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), you get terms involving different powers of c. Now, when you multiply these two expansions together, each term from the first expansion is multiplied by each term from the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by every term from the second part, which are terms like \\(c^6\\), \\(c^5\\), ..., \\(c^0\\), ..., \\(c^{-6}\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will appear multiplied by each of these c terms. However, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would mean that we're looking for all the terms where the exponents of a and b are 2, regardless of the exponents of c. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part, because each term from the second part will be multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nWait, but the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by setting c = 1. So, when c = 1, \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion is 64. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 * 64 = 384. But wait, let me check if that makes sense. Alternatively, maybe I'm supposed to consider that the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is only multiplied by the constant term from the second expansion, which is the term where the exponent of c is zero. Let me think again.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the powers of c, meaning that we're considering all possible terms where a and b are squared, and c can be any power. But if that's the case, then the coefficient would indeed be 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part, which is 6 * 64 = 384. However, that seems a bit odd because usually, when you're asked for the coefficient of a specific term, you might be considering only the term where all variables are present, but in this case, since the problem is only specifying \\(a^2b^2\\), perhaps it's correct to consider that any power of c is acceptable.\n\nWait, but let me think again. The problem is stated as: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, in the entire product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will appear multiplied by each term from the second expansion. So, for example, \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^5\\), ..., \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), ..., \\(a^2b^2c^{-6}\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the coefficient from the first part (which is 6) multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. But the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is actually the sum of all the coefficients from the second part, because each term from the second part is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Maybe the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and not considering the second part at all. But that doesn't make sense because the entire expression includes both parts. Wait, but the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which would mean that \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by terms from the second expansion. So, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me check with a smaller example to see if that makes sense. Suppose we have \\((a + b)^2 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^1\\). Then, expanding, we get \\((a^2 + 2ab + b^2)(c + 1/c)\\). The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be zero because in the first part, the highest power is \\(a^2\\) and \\(b^2\\), but when multiplied by the second part, which only has c and 1/c, there's no term with \\(a^2b^2c^k\\). Wait, but in this case, \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't appear at all because the first expansion only goes up to \\(a^2\\) and \\(b^2\\), but the second expansion doesn't contribute any \\(a\\) or \\(b\\) terms. Hmm, so in that case, the coefficient would be zero. Wait, but that contradicts my earlier reasoning. So, maybe I was wrong earlier.\n\nWait, in that smaller example, \\((a + b)^2 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^1\\), the expansion is \\((a^2 + 2ab + b^2)(c + 1/c)\\). So, the terms are \\(a^2c\\), \\(a^2/c\\), \\(2abc\\), \\(2ab/c\\), \\(b^2c\\), \\(b^2/c\\). There's no term with \\(a^2b^2\\), so the coefficient is zero. Therefore, in the original problem, perhaps the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is zero because the second expansion doesn't contribute any \\(a\\) or \\(b\\) terms. Wait, but that can't be right because the second expansion is in terms of c and 1/c, so it doesn't involve a or b at all. Therefore, when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the only terms involving a and b will be as they are in the first expansion, each multiplied by some power of c. Therefore, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^5\\), etc. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would require that the exponents of a and b are both 2, but any exponent of c is acceptable. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part.\n\nWait, but in the smaller example, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be zero because there's no such term. But in the original problem, \\((a + b)^4\\) does have a term \\(a^2b^2\\), so when multiplied by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), that term will be present in the product, but multiplied by each term from the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384. But wait, in the smaller example, \\((a + b)^2 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^1\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 2ab * (c + 1/c), but that's not \\(a^2b^2\\). So, actually, in that case, there is no \\(a^2b^2\\) term, so the coefficient is zero. Therefore, perhaps in the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me think again. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6a^2b^2. When multiplied by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which expands to a sum of terms like \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - k}(1/c)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\\), so each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\\). Therefore, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each of these terms, resulting in terms like \\(6a^2b^2 \\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 times the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion, because each term in the second expansion contributes its coefficient when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient is 6 * (sum of coefficients in second expansion).\n\nThe sum of coefficients in the second expansion is found by setting c = 1, which gives \\((1 + 1/1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384. So, the answer should be 384.\n\nWait, but let me check this with another approach. Alternatively, perhaps I can consider that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient from the first part times the entire second expansion, because each term in the second expansion is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So, I think the coefficient is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), whose sum of coefficients is 64 when \\(c = 1\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n\\boxed{384}"

So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), is 6. But wait, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I think the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first part will just be multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. But since the second part involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), which are different variables, they don't affect the powers of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). So, when I multiply the two expansions together, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part will just be multiplied by every term in the second expansion. But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and not any specific term involving \\(c\\), I think I don't need to worry about the second part. Wait, no, actually, the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression. But since the second part doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), it's just a scalar multiplier for the first expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. Wait, that doesn't make sense. No, actually, when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second. But in this case, the second polynomial is in terms of \\(c\\), which is a different variable, so the coefficients involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are independent of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, times the sum of all the coefficients from the second part, because when you multiply by each term in the second part, each term adds a multiple to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, that might not be correct. Let me think again. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when you expand this, each term will be a product of a term from the first expansion and a term from the second expansion. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients in the second part. Because every term in the second expansion will multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term, effectively scaling it by each of those coefficients. So, first, let me find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which we found to be 6. Then, I need to find the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). To find the sum of all coefficients in a polynomial, you can substitute \\(c = 1\\). Because when \\(c = 1\\), each term becomes just its coefficient. So, substituting \\(c = 1\\), we get \\(\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = (1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of all coefficients in the second part is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 multiplied by 64, which is 384. Wait, is that correct? Let me double-check. Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Since the second part is multiplied by the first, and the \\(a^2b^2\\) term is independent of \\(c\\), the coefficient would just be the coefficient from the first part times the entire second expansion. But actually, no, because each term in the second expansion is a separate term, so when you multiply, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\), it would indeed be the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all coefficients from the second part. So, 6 times 64 is 384. Alternatively, perhaps I can think of it as the coefficient being 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part, but since we're only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and the second part doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), the coefficient remains 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second part, which is 64, so 6*64=384.

Wait, no, that might not be right.

So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the sum of all possible products where the terms from the first expansion multiply terms from the second expansion such that the product has \\(a^2b^2\\). But since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve c or 1/c, we need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because when we multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), the c terms won't affect the a and b terms. So, let me check that.\n\nSo, first, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, as I found earlier. Now, for the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), I need to find the term where the exponent of c is 0 because when we multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), which has no c terms, the product will have \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by \\(c^0\\), which is 1. So, the term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) with \\(c^0\\) is the middle term, I think.

We want the term where the exponent of c is 0, so we set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for m, we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). So, the term where m=3 is the one with \\(c^0\\).

So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion, which has a coefficient of 6, would be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term without \\(c\\), the only way it can contribute to the final term \\(a^2b^2\\) is if it's multiplied by the constant term (i.e., the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero) in the second expansion. Otherwise, if it's multiplied by a term with \\(c\\) raised to some power, that would create a term like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), which isn't just \\(a^2b^2\\). So, I need to find the term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero.\n\nSo, let's set the exponent equal to zero: \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(6 = 2m\\) so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the term where \\(m = 3\\) is the constant term. The coefficient for this term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20.\n\nTherefore, when I multiply the term \\(a^2b^2\\) (which has a coefficient of 6) by the constant term (which is 20), the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression becomes \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nWait a second, let me make sure I'm not missing anything. So, the expansion is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). The \\(a^2b^2\\) term comes only from the first part, and since we're multiplying by the constant term of the second part, the coefficient is just 6 times 20, which is 120. That seems right.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should think about it another way. The entire expression is the product of two expansions. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the only way it can appear in the product is when it's multiplied by \\(c^0\\). So, that's why I only need to consider the constant term in the second expansion.\n\nLet me double-check my calculations. For \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). For \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the constant term is when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, which happens when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), so \\(m = 3\\), and \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, 6 times 20 is 120. That seems correct.\n\nI think I might have overcomplicated it at first, but breaking it down step by step, it makes sense. So, the coefficient is 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem.\n\nFirst, consider the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n\\]\nWe need the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2. This occurs when \\(k = 2\\):\n\\[\n\\dbinom{4}{2} a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\n\\]\nSo, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\nNext, consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem:\n\\[\n\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n\\]\nWe need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. This occurs when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), so \\(m = 3\\):\n\\[\n\\dbinom{6}{3} c^0 = 20\n\\]\nSo, the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20.\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, we multiply the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) from \\((a + b)^4\\) by the constant term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):\n\\[\n6 \\times 20 = 120\n\\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

Now, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I think I need to consider the product of the two expansions. But wait, actually, the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms are in one part, and the \\(c\\) terms are in another. So, maybe the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just the coefficient from the first expansion, regardless of what happens in the second part. Let me think. When you multiply two expressions, each term from the first expression gets multiplied by each term from the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by every term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I think that term is just the coefficient from the first part, because the second part doesn't affect the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). Wait, no, that might not be correct. Let me clarify: the entire expression is a product of two separate binomial expansions. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by each term from the second part. But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the other variables, perhaps I need to consider the entire product. Wait, no, I think that's not right because \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\). So, in the product, \\(a^2b^2\\) is just a term, and each term in the second expansion is a power of \\(c\\). So, when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, you get terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) where \\(k\\) is the exponent from the second expansion. But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would only include the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, because otherwise, the term would have \\(c\\) raised to some power. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion. Because that's the only term that would result in \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms. So, now I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me apply the binomial theorem again to this part. \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, I need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, which means \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Let me compute that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Now, going back to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficients from each part. So, that's 6 (from the first expansion) multiplied by 20 (from the second expansion). Let me compute that: 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120. Wait, but let me double-check to make sure I didn't make a mistake. So, in the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). In the second part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term with \\(c^0\\) is when \\(m = 3\\), so \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying them together gives 6 * 20 = 120. That seems correct.

But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. Hmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, perhaps the problem is treating the entire expression as a single polynomial in \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\), and \\(1/c\\), and it's asking for the coefficient of the term where \\(a\\) is squared, \\(b\\) is squared, and the other variables \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) are whatever they are. But that seems complicated because \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) can combine in various ways. Wait, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without considering the \\(c\\) terms, meaning that the coefficient would be the same as in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But that doesn't make sense because the coefficient should be a number, not a polynomial. Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, when expanded, this would be a product of two polynomials. Each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from \\((a + b)^4\\) would be multiplied by every term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be \\(6 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that's still a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient, which is a number, so maybe I'm supposed to consider that the entire expression is being treated as a single term, but that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only considering the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, meaning that the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that would be 6 times \\(2^6\\) because each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) has coefficients that are binomial coefficients, but the sum of the coefficients would be when \\(c = 1\\), so \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). So, 6 times 64 is 384. But wait, that seems too straightforward. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which would be 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but that's a polynomial, not a number. Hmm, maybe I'm misinterpreting the problem. Let me check again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, perhaps the problem is considering the entire expression as a product, and it's asking for the coefficient of the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any term from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial, but the problem is asking for a coefficient, which is a number. So, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning that the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, so that the term is just \\(a^2b^2\\). That would make sense because then the coefficient would be a number. So, perhaps the problem is implicitly asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). Alternatively, maybe it's just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, but that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, which doesn't make sense. So, perhaps I should assume that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\). That seems plausible. So, to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), I need to consider the expansion of both parts. \n\nFirst, from \\((a + b)^4\\), as before, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. Then, from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), I need the coefficient of \\(c^0\\), because when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), it will give \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). So, let's find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\times (1/c)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We want the exponent of \\(c\\) to be 0, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which implies \\(k = 3\\). So, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 20. \n\nNow, since the two parts are multiplied together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficients from each part. So, that's 6 (from \\(a^2b^2\\)) times 20 (from \\(c^0\\)), which equals 120. Therefore, the coefficient is 120. \n\nWait, but let me double-check that. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\) with coefficient 6, and the term \\(c^0\\) comes from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) with coefficient 20. When multiplied together, 6 * 20 = 120. So, yes, that seems correct. \n\nAlternatively, if I didn't consider the \\(c^0\\) part, and just took the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) as 6, and multiplied it by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial, but that's not a single number. So, I think the correct interpretation is that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. \n\nWait, but let me make sure that the problem is indeed asking for \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). The problem says, \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)\". So, it's possible that the problem is only considering the variables \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable. But in that case, the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because coefficients are usually constants. So, perhaps the problem is implicitly asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning that \\(c\\) is raised to the zero power. Alternatively, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, but that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, which is unlikely. Therefore, I think the correct interpretation is that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. \n\nLet me recap: \n\n1. Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is 6.\n\n2. Expand \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\), which is 20.\n\n3. Multiply these two coefficients together to get 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is 120. \n\nI think that's the correct answer. Let me see if there's another way to approach this. Alternatively, I could consider the entire expansion as a product and look for the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by a term from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) that has \\(c^0\\). So, that's exactly what I did. \n\nAnother way to think about it is that when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each polynomial. So, in this case, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial and the term \\(c^0\\) in the second polynomial will multiply to give the term \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product, with the coefficient being the product of the two individual coefficients. \n\nSo, yes, I'm confident that the coefficient is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is found by multiplying the binomial coefficients from each part of the expression. \n\n1. From \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n2. From \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n3. Multiplying these coefficients gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\boxed{120}."

But that doesn't seem right because when you multiply by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in that expansion would multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, not a number. So, perhaps the problem is only considering the coefficient in \\((a + b)^4\\) and not worrying about the \\(c\\) terms. But that seems unlikely because the problem includes both parts. Maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, meaning that the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that also doesn't seem right because the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) are not all the same. Wait, perhaps the problem is actually just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and the second part is just a separate expansion that doesn't affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). But that seems contradictory because when you multiply two expressions, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. But that would mean the coefficient is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Let me check that.\n\nThe sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\). So, \\(\\left(1 + 1/1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of the coefficients is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 * 64 = 384. But wait, is that correct? Because when you multiply by the entire expansion, each term in the expansion would multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term, so the coefficient would be 6 times each term in the expansion. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would be the sum of all those products. So, yes, 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. So, is that the answer? Let me think again. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient in the first part, which is 6, and the second part is irrelevant because it's multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), but that doesn't make sense because the second part is a separate polynomial. Hmm, I'm a bit confused.\n\nWait, let's approach it differently. Let's consider the entire expression: \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). When we expand this, each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second part. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a specific term, but in the context of multiple variables, perhaps it's considering the coefficient as a polynomial. But the problem is phrased as \"the coefficient\", which is usually a single number. So, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some \\(k\\), but it's not specified. Alternatively, maybe it's just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). But in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which would make it a polynomial. But since the problem is asking for a coefficient, perhaps it's expecting a numerical value, so maybe I need to consider that the coefficient is 6 multiplied by the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 64, as I calculated earlier. So, 6 * 64 = 384. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 384. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it, and the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and the \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) part is irrelevant because it's multiplied by the entire expression. But that doesn't make sense because the entire expression is a product, so each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times each term in the second expansion. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so perhaps it's considering all the terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nWait, but let me think again. If I have \\((a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. Now, when I multiply this by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial in \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be \\(6 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that's a polynomial, not a single number. So, perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient in the first part, which is 6, and the second part is just a multiplier. But that doesn't make sense because the second part is an expansion. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, considering that each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), so the coefficient would be 6 times each coefficient in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But the problem is asking for a single coefficient, so perhaps it's expecting the sum of all those coefficients, which would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). As I calculated earlier, the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and the rest is just part of the expression, but that seems unlikely because the problem includes both parts. Hmm, I'm a bit confused, but I think the correct approach is to consider that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. Therefore, the coefficient is 384.\n\nWait, but let me check that again. The sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is indeed found by setting \\(c = 1\\), so \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, the sum is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 * 64 = 384. So, I think that's the answer.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. When this is multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\boxed{384}."

Now, the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but the term we're interested in is \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\). So, does that mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just 6 times whatever the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)? Because if we multiply by \\(c^0\\), which is 1, it won't affect the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think again.

So, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me apply the binomial theorem again to \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying each term, that's \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m} = \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We want the exponent of \\(c\\) to be zero, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20.

In \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Since the two parts are multiplied together, the overall coefficient is 6 * 20, which is indeed 120. So, I think that's the answer. But just to make sure I didn't make a mistake, let me go through it again. Expanding \\((a + b)^4\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed when k=2, so \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}=6\\). Then, for \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term with \\(c^0\\) is when m=3, so \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}=20\\). Multiplying 6 and 20 gives 120.

So, the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) for \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. \n\nBut wait, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I think I need to consider the expansion of both parts. But the problem is only asking about the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which only comes from the \\((a + b)^4\\) part. The other part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), when expanded, will involve terms with \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), but since we're only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), maybe the other part just contributes a constant factor?

So, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion.

So, the only way to get a term with \\(a^2b^2\\) is to multiply it by the constant term (i.e., the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero) from the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nSo, I already found that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.

So, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\).

Wait, that might not be correct. Let me think again. When you multiply two expressions, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each expression. But in this case, since the first expression only has terms with \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the second expression only has terms with \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), the cross terms when multiplied will have \\(a^k b^{4 - k} c^m\\) or \\(a^k b^{4 - k} (1/c)^m\\), etc. So, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first part, when multiplied by the second part, will just be \\(6a^2b^2 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 times the sum of the coefficients of all terms in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But wait, that's not exactly right. Because when you multiply \\(6a^2b^2\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product will be 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), perhaps the coefficient is just 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that doesn't make sense because the sum of all coefficients would be when \\(c = 1\\). Let me check that. If I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(1 + 1/1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 * 64 = 384. But wait, is that correct? Let me think again. Because when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each polynomial. But in this case, the first polynomial is \\((a + b)^4\\) and the second is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the first polynomial, and it's multiplied by every term in the second polynomial. However, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient would be 6 (from \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part) multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. But that seems too large. Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, in that case, the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of the second part, because each term in the second part is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). But that would mean the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which is 6 * 64 = 384. But let me check that again. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the powers of \\(c\\), so we can treat the second part as a separate polynomial and multiply it by 6. So, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients of all terms in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384. But I'm not entirely sure. Let me try another approach. Let's think of the entire expression as \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). When we expand this, each term will be of the form \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}a^{4 - k}b^k \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - m}(1/c)^m\\). So, simplifying, that's \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}\\dbinom{6}{m} a^{4 - k}b^k c^{6 - 2m}\\). Now, we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so we set \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). So, \\(k = 2\\), and the coefficient from the first part is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Now, for the second part, we have \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\) and the exponent of \\(c\\) is \\(6 - 2m\\). But since we're only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the exponent of \\(c\\), we need to sum over all possible \\(m\\) the coefficients \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\). So, the total coefficient is 6 times the sum of \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\) for \\(m = 0\\) to \\(6\\). The sum of binomial coefficients \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\) from \\(m = 0\\) to \\(6\\) is \\(2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the total coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 384. Wait, but let me make sure I'm not missing something. Is there a possibility that the exponents of \\(c\\) could affect the term \\(a^2b^2\\)? For example, could there be a term where \\(c^0\\) is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), which would just be \\(a^2b^2\\), but I think in this case, since we're looking for the coefficient regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, it's just the product of the coefficients. So, I think 384 is correct. Alternatively, if the problem had asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some specific \\(k\\), then we would need to consider the exponent of \\(c\\), but since it's just \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\), the coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384. Therefore, the final answer should be 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.

So, the coefficient is 6. \n\nNow, the original expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, after expanding \\((a + b)^4\\), we'll have terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and each of those will be multiplied by the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, the problem is only asking about the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). That means I don't need to worry about the \\(c\\) terms because they won't affect the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. In other words, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression will just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but since we're only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), the \\(c\\) terms can be considered as constants in this context. Wait, no, actually, when you multiply two polynomials, each term from the first polynomial is multiplied by each term from the second polynomial. But in this case, since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part will just be multiplied by every term from the second part. However, since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), I think that the coefficient will just be the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. Wait, no, that doesn't make sense because the expansion of the second part includes multiple terms, each with their own coefficients. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, each term will contribute to the overall coefficient. But wait, no, actually, each term in the second expansion is a separate term, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, each term will contribute to the overall coefficient. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but actually, no. Let me think again. When you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each polynomial. But in this case, since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second part. However, since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), the coefficient will be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. Because each term in the second expansion contributes to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when multiplied by 6. Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Let me try another approach. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from \\((a + b)^4\\), specifically the term \\(6a^2b^2\\). Then, when multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in that expansion will be multiplied by \\(6a^2b^2\\), resulting in terms like \\(6a^2b^2c^k\\) where \\(k\\) ranges from -6 to 6 in steps of 2. But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), the coefficient will be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) contributes to the coefficient when multiplied by 6. Wait, but actually, the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\). So, let me calculate that. If I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = (2)^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 times 64, which is 384. Wait, but is that correct? Let me double-check. Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, and when multiplied by each term in the second expansion, each term's coefficient is added to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the total coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 times 64, which is 384. That seems high. Let me think again. Alternatively, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where \\(c\\) cancels out, i.e., \\(c^0\\). Because if that's the case, then I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion. That would make more sense. So, perhaps I misread the problem. Let me check again. The problem says: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)\". So, it's just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. But that seems too large. Alternatively, perhaps I'm supposed to consider that the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, but since the problem doesn't specify anything about \\(c\\), the coefficient is just 6 times the entire second expansion, but that doesn't make sense because the second expansion is a polynomial in \\(c\\), and the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would then be a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, so perhaps it's just 6 times the sum of the coefficients, which is 64, giving 384. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where \\(c\\) cancels out. That would make more sense because otherwise, the coefficient would be a polynomial, not a number. So, perhaps I should assume that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). Let me try that approach. So, first, find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, as before. Then, find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). To find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\), which is the constant term, I can use the binomial theorem again. The general term in the expansion is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We want the exponent of \\(c\\) to be 0, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire expression is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). That seems more reasonable. So, perhaps the problem was asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), but it was written as \\(a^2b^2\\). Alternatively, maybe the problem is written correctly, and the answer is 384, but that seems too large. Let me check again. If I consider that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, and when multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. But that would mean that the coefficient is a number, not a polynomial, which is possible because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would be 384. But I'm not sure which interpretation is correct. Let me see if I can find similar problems. Typically, when asked for the coefficient of a term in a product of two expressions, if the variables are separate, the coefficient would be the product of the coefficients from each expression. But in this case, since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would indeed be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expression, which is 64, giving 384. Alternatively, if the problem was asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), it would be 120. So, perhaps I need to clarify. But since the problem is written as is, I think it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\), so the answer would be 384. But I'm not entirely sure. Let me think of another way. Suppose I expand both expressions separately and then multiply them. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the first expression, and when multiplied by each term in the second expression, it becomes \\(6a^2b^2 \\times \\text{(each term in the second expansion)}\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, because each term in the second expansion is a coefficient times some power of \\(c\\), but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\), it's 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. So, the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion is when \\(c = 1\\), which is \\(2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, 6 * 64 = 384. So, I think that's the answer. But I'm still a bit confused because usually, when you're asked for the coefficient of a term in a product, you might need to consider the specific exponents, but in this case, since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), the coefficient is just the product of the coefficients from each part. So, I think 384 is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\(2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n\\boxed{384}"

That would correspond to \\(k = 2\\) in the binomial expansion because then \\(a^{4 - 2} = a^2\\) and \\(b^2\\). So, the coefficient for that term would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Let me calculate that. \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6.

But the question is only asking about the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is part of the first binomial expansion. Since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are in the first part, and the second part involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), maybe the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just 6 times whatever the constant term is in the second part, because we don't want any \\(c\\) terms multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, no, actually, when you multiply two expressions together, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression. But since the question is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I think we need to find the term in the second part that doesn't involve \\(c\\) so that when we multiply it by \\(a^2b^2\\), it remains as a term with \\(a^2b^2\\). Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think again. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when we multiply these two, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), that means we're looking for the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by some term from the second expression. But actually, since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), the \\(a^2b^2\\) term is just multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. Wait, but that would mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a coefficient, not an expression. Hmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again. It says, \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" Wait, so perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion of that entire product, but considering that the product is a sum of terms involving \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\), and \\(1/c\\). But since the question is about \\(a^2b^2\\), that implies that the coefficient would be a term that is a product of the coefficients from both expansions, specifically the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the coefficient of some term in the second part. But actually, no, because \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), so when you multiply the two expansions, the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are independent of those involving \\(c\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by every term in the second expansion, but the coefficient would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the entire second expansion. Wait, that can't be right because then the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for a coefficient, which is a numerical value. Hmm, maybe I'm missing something. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\), ignoring the second part. But that seems unlikely because the problem includes both parts. Alternatively, maybe the second part is a constant term, so that when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), it remains as a term with \\(a^2b^2\\) and a constant coefficient. So, perhaps I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and then find the constant term in the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), and then multiply those two coefficients together to get the final coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression. That makes sense because if the second part has a constant term, say \\(k\\), then when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by \\(k\\), you get \\(k a^2b^2\\), so the coefficient would be \\(6k\\). So, let's try that approach. First, find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, as I found earlier. Then, find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). To find the constant term, I can use the binomial theorem again. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We want the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, because that's the constant term. So, set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which gives \\(m = 3\\). So, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Let me calculate that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Wait, that seems right, but let me double-check. Alternatively, maybe I should consider that each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which comes from the first part, and the second part's constant term, as any other term would introduce a \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\) factor, which would make the term not just \\(a^2b^2\\), but something like \\(a^2b^2 c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2 c^{-k}\\). So, only the constant term from the second part will contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion. Therefore, the coefficient is indeed 6 * 20 = 120. Let me just confirm the calculations again. \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) is 6, correct. For the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), we set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), so \\(m=3\\), and \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\) is 20, correct. So, 6 * 20 = 120. Yeah, that seems right. So, the coefficient is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is found by first determining the coefficient in \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem, which is 6. Then, finding the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20. Multiplying these together gives 120.\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\boxed{120}."

Or maybe it's 6 times the entire expansion of the second expression, but since we're only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), perhaps the \\(c\\) terms don't matter because they're multiplied by other terms. Wait, no, actually, no. Because when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the entire second part. But that doesn't make sense because the second part is a separate variable. Wait, no, the variables are different: \\(a, b\\) and \\(c\\). So, when you multiply them, the terms are separate.

But that can't be right because the problem is asking for a specific coefficient, so perhaps I'm misunderstanding. Wait, maybe I need to consider that the second expression is also being multiplied, so when I multiply the two expansions, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first part will be multiplied by every term in the second part, but since the second part involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), which are different variables, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will just be multiplied by the entire second expression, but since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\), maybe the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expression.

Wait, no, that's not quite right. Actually, when you have two separate variables, the product will have terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2c^{-k}\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually be the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all coefficients in the second part, because each term in the second part will multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term, contributing to the coefficient. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients of the second expression. But wait, the second expression is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The sum of the coefficients in a polynomial is found by setting all variables to 1. So, if I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = (2)^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of the coefficients in the second expression is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 * 64 = 384. Wait, but let me check that again. Because when you multiply two expressions, the coefficient of a specific term in one expression is multiplied by the entire other expression, so in this case, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first expression is 6, and when multiplied by the second expression, which is a sum of terms involving \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expression.

So, that means we can treat the second expression as a constant with respect to \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and just multiply the coefficient from the first part by the entire second expression. But that would mean the coefficient is 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial, not a constant. But the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, so perhaps I'm misunderstanding.\n\nWait, no, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, which includes all terms, but since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\), and \\(1/c\\) are different variables, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) can be combined with any power of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient from the first part, 6, multiplied by the entire second expression, which is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would make the coefficient a polynomial, not a number. So, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), that is, the term where the exponents of \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are 2, 2, and 0, respectively. That would make more sense because then it's a specific term. So, maybe I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product. Let me check the problem again: it says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\". Hmm, maybe it's just \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expression, which is 6 * 64 = 384, as I thought earlier. Alternatively, if it's \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then I need to find the coefficient where \\(c^0\\) is present, which would be the middle term of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me calculate that.\n\nFirst, let me find the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem, this is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, the general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). Now, to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\), we set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is 6 * 20 = 120. But wait, the problem just says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", so maybe it's 6 times the entire expansion, which would be 6 * 64 = 384. But if it's \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it's 120. I'm confused now. Let me re-read the problem: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" It doesn't specify anything about \\(c\\), so maybe it's considering all possible powers of \\(c\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expression, which is 6 * 64 = 384. But I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), so it's 6 times the entire second expression, but that would make the coefficient a polynomial, which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. Therefore, perhaps I need to consider that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of the powers of \\(c\\), which would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expression, which is 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, if it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it's 6 * 20 = 120. I think the correct interpretation is that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the powers of \\(c\\), so it's 6 * 64 = 384. Let me confirm that.\n\nWait, another way to think about it: when you have a product of two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in one variable is the product of the coefficient of that term in the first polynomial and the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial. So, in this case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the sum of all coefficients in the second part. The sum of all coefficients in the second part is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). So, the coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384. Therefore, the answer should be 384.\n\nBut wait, I'm still a bit unsure because sometimes problems specify that you need to consider all variables, but in this case, the problem only specifies \\(a^2b^2\\), so I think the correct approach is to multiply the coefficient from the first part by the sum of all coefficients in the second part. So, 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me think again. If I have \\((a + b)^4\\) times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), then the expansion would have terms like \\(a^4b^0c^6\\), \\(a^4b^0c^4\\), etc., all the way down. But the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the same regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, so it's just 6 times the entire expansion of the second part. So, yes, 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but actually, when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a term in one variable is the product of the coefficient of that term in the first polynomial and the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial. So, in this case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, and the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial is 64, so the total coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nTherefore, I think the correct answer is 384.\n\nWait, but to make sure, let me consider an example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^1 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, the expansion is \\((a + b)(c + 1/c) = ac + a/c + bc + b/c\\). The coefficient of \\(a^1b^0\\) would be \\(c + 1/c\\), but if I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^1b^0\\), regardless of \\(c\\), then it's just 1 times the sum of coefficients in the second polynomial, which is \\(1 + 1 = 2\\). So, the coefficient would be 2. Similarly, in our problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. That makes sense.\n\nAlternatively, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it's 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second polynomial, which is 20, so 6 * 20 = 120. But since the problem doesn't specify \\(c^0\\), I think it's 384.\n\nWait, but let me check the problem again: it says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\". It doesn't mention \\(c\\) at all, so I think it's asking for the coefficient regardless of the powers of \\(c\\), which would mean 6 times 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but I'm still a bit confused because in the product, each term is a combination of \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\), and \\(1/c\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually be multiplied by each term in the second polynomial, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), etc. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually be the sum of all those terms, which is 6 times the entire second polynomial. But the problem is asking for the coefficient, which is a number, so perhaps it's 6 times the sum of the coefficients of the second polynomial, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nYes, I think that's correct. So, the coefficient is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplying it by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The sum of the coefficients in the second expression is found by evaluating it at \\(c = 1\\), giving \\(2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n\\boxed{384}"

    "text": " So, in this expansion, I need to find the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) occurs. That would be when \\(4 - k = 2\\) for \\(a\\), which means \\(k = 2\\). So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Let me calculate that: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient is 6. Now, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Since I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I think that term will only come from the \\((a + b)^4\\) part because the other part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\). Wait, is that right? Let me think again. When you multiply two expressions together, each term from the first expression gets multiplied by each term from the second expression. But since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are only in the first part, and the second part is in terms of \\(c\\), maybe the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will just be multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 multiplied by whatever the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is. But wait, the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, perhaps the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by all the terms from the second expression, but since the problem doesn't specify any particular term in \\(c\\), maybe we just need the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. Alternatively, maybe the question is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times some specific term in \\(c\\), but the way it's written, it's just asking for \\(a^2b^2\\), so perhaps the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of the second part. Wait, that can't be right because the problem is asking for a specific coefficient, so maybe I'm misunderstanding. Let me read the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, I think it's asking for the coefficient of the term \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by any term from the second expansion. So, in other words, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't make much sense because each term in the second expansion would have a coefficient and a power of \\(c\\). Alternatively, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which would mean that the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that seems odd because the coefficient would then be a polynomial in \\(c\\). Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it, and the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating the entire second expression as a single term. That is, the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems unlikely because the question probably expects a numerical coefficient. Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me check the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" Hmm, perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times any term from the second expansion, but since the question doesn't specify a particular term in \\(c\\), maybe it's just 6 times the entire expansion.

But wait, that seems too straightforward, and I'm not sure if that's what the problem is asking. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times a specific term in \\(c\\), but the problem doesn't specify, so perhaps it's just 6 times the entire expansion, which would be 6 * \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems odd because the answer would then be a polynomial in \\(c\\), but the problem is asking for a coefficient, which is a number. Wait, perhaps I'm misinterpreting the question. Maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating \\(c\\) as a variable, so the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\). But that seems complicated, and I don't think that's what is intended. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), that is, the constant term in \\(c\\). Because in the second expansion, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the constant term is when the powers of \\(c\\) cancel out. So, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times the constant term in \\(c\\). That would make sense because then the coefficient would be a number. Let me check that. So, if I expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). The constant term occurs when \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), so \\(k = 3\\). The coefficient for that term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times the constant term in \\(c\\) would be 6 * 20 = 120. So, the coefficient is 120. Alternatively, if the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, then it would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, which doesn't seem right. Since the problem is asking for a coefficient, I think it's more likely that it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times the constant term in \\(c\\), which is 120. Let me double-check that. So, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. In \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the constant term is 20. So, when you multiply these together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times the constant term is 6 * 20 = 120. That seems correct. Alternatively, if I consider the entire expansion, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, so the coefficient would be 6 times each coefficient from the second expansion. But since the problem doesn't specify a particular term in \\(c\\), perhaps it's just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times the entire second expansion, which would be 6 times the entire expansion. But that would make the coefficient a polynomial, which doesn't seem right. Therefore, I think the intended interpretation is that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times the constant term in \\(c\\), which is 120. So, my final answer is 120.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can proceed as follows:\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term containing \\(a^2b^2\\) occurs when \\(k = 2\\), so its coefficient is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\n   \\]\n\n2. **Consider the second part \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   We need the constant term (where the power of \\(c\\) is zero) because we are looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms.

But wait, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I think the coefficient we found, 6, is part of the product. But does the other part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)? Hmm, I don't think so because when you multiply two expressions, the variables are separate. So, \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are in the first part, and \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) are in the second part. So, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term would be multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), maybe the other part doesn't matter because we're only concerned with the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). Let me think again: when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). However, since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term from the first expansion and it's multiplied by all the terms from the second expansion, but since the second expansion involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), which are different variables, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would just be the coefficient from the first part, right? Because the second part doesn't affect the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), it only adds terms with \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would just be 6, multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part, but since we're only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is separate from \\(c\\), I think the coefficient remains 6. Wait, but that seems too straightforward. Maybe I'm missing something. Let me double-check. Let's consider the entire product: \\((a + b)^4\\) times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, when you multiply two polynomials, each term from the first polynomial is multiplied by each term from the second polynomial. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by each term in the expansion of the second part. However, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but since we're just looking for the coefficient, which is a numerical factor, and \\(a^2b^2\\) is a separate term, I think the coefficient is indeed 6 multiplied by whatever the coefficient is for the constant term in the second expansion, because otherwise, the term would have \\(c\\)s in it, which we don't want. Wait, that might make more sense. So, maybe I was wrong earlier. Let me think again. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so when we multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But if we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), then any term in the second expansion that has a non-zero power of \\(c\\) would result in a term like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2/c^k\\), which aren't just \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the only term in the second expansion that doesn't involve \\(c\\) is the constant term, which is when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. So, perhaps the coefficient we're looking for is 6 multiplied by the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). That makes more sense. So, I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Let me calculate that. Using the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(1/c\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, the exponent of \\(c\\) in each term is \\(6 - 2k\\). We want the exponent to be zero, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). So, the constant term is when \\(k = 3\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} c^{0} = \\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (the constant term from the second part), which is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). So, the coefficient is 120. Let me just make sure I didn't make any mistakes here. So, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). In \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the constant term is when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, which occurs when \\(k = 3\\), so \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying these together gives 6 * 20 = 120. Yeah, that seems correct. I think I got it right.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is found by first determining the coefficient in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplying it by the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20. Thus, the final coefficient is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{120}"
