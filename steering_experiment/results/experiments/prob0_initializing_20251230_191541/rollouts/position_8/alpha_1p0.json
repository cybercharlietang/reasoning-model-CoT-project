    "text": " So, I need to find the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) appears in this expansion. That would happen when \\(4 - k = 2\\), so \\(k = 2\\). So, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Let me calculate that: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\\). So, the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) part is 6. Now, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be the coefficient from the first part, 6, multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but hold on, the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so maybe I don't need to consider the \\(c\\) terms at all? Because \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\). Hmm, that might be the case. Let me think. So, when you multiply two expressions, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression. So, if I'm looking for a term that only has \\(a^2b^2\\), that term would come from multiplying the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from \\((a + b)^4\\) by the constant term (the term with \\(c^0\\)) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because if I multiply by any other term involving \\(c\\), it would introduce \\(c\\) terms into the product, which would make it \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or something, but the problem is only asking for \\(a^2b^2\\), so I think I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) and then multiply it by 6. So, first, let's find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Again, I can use the binomial theorem here. So, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying that, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m} = \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). Now, the constant term is when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. So, set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(6 = 2m\\) so \\(m = 3\\). So, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the second part). So, 6 * 20 = 120. Wait, is that all? Let me double-check. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the product of the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first binomial and the constant term in the second binomial, because any other term in the second binomial would introduce a \\(c\\) term, which would make the overall term not just \\(a^2b^2\\). So, yeah, I think that's correct. So, the coefficient is 120. Let me write that down as the final answer.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is found by considering the expansion of each part separately. Using the binomial theorem, the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the constant term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Multiplying these gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{120}"

    "text": " So, I need to find the term where \\(a\\) is squared and \\(b\\) is squared. That would be when \\(4 - k = 2\\) for \\(a\\), which means \\(k = 2\\) for \\(b\\). So, the coefficient here would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Let me calculate that: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), is 6. Now, the expression also has the second part, which is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I wonder if this part affects the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, actually, since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), maybe the second part doesn't directly affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Hmm, but let me think again. The entire expression is the product of \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when you multiply these two expressions, each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since the variables are different, the coefficients for \\(a^2b^2\\) would come from the product of the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion and any term in the second expansion. But wait, actually, no. Because when you multiply two expressions, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), that would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the entire second part, because \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) don't appear in the second part. So, the second part doesn't affect the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. But wait, that doesn't make sense because the second part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a separate variable. So, when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), you're effectively creating terms like \\(a^kb^{4 - k} \\times c^m\\) or \\(a^kb^{4 - k} \\times c^{-m}\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, but since the variables are different, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually be the same as in the first part, times the entire second expansion. Wait, that can't be right because the second part has multiple terms. So, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question. Wait, maybe the question is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, which includes all the terms from both expansions. But since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be the coefficient from the first part, because the second part doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be 6, as calculated from the first part, and the second part doesn't affect it. But wait, that seems too straightforward. Let me check again. Alternatively, maybe I'm supposed to consider that the entire expression is multiplied, so when you expand both, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) don't appear in the second part, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the same as in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and the rest would involve \\(c\\) terms. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the entire expansion of the second part, but since the question is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term without \\(c\\), maybe I'm misunderstanding. Wait, no, because when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), you get terms like \\(a^2b^2 \\times c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2 \\times c^4\\), etc., but the term \\(a^2b^2\\) itself would have a coefficient that's the product of the coefficients from both expansions. Wait, no, because \\(c\\) and \\(a\\), \\(b\\) are separate variables, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the same as in the first part, because the second part doesn't affect \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). So, perhaps the answer is just 6. But let me think again. Alternatively, maybe I'm supposed to consider that the entire expression is a product, so when you expand it, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all terms in the second part. But that doesn't make sense because the second part is a separate variable. Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try to write it out more formally. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me denote \\(A = (a + b)^4\\) and \\(B = \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Then, the entire expression is \\(A \\times B\\). When you expand \\(A\\), you get terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and when you expand \\(B\\), you get terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, when you multiply \\(A\\) and \\(B\\), each term in \\(A\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(B\\). Therefore, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(A\\) will be multiplied by each term in \\(B\\), resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), etc. But the question is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\). Wait, that can't happen because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by any term in \\(B\\), you'll get a term involving \\(c\\). So, does that mean there's no term with just \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms? Hmm, that seems to be the case. So, perhaps the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is zero because there are no terms where \\(c\\) cancels out. Wait, but that seems odd. Let me think again. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. But that doesn't make sense because when you multiply, each term in \\(A\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(B\\), so the \\(a^2b^2\\) term would be multiplied by each term in \\(B\\), resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), etc., but not a term with just \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) alone is zero because there's no term without \\(c\\). Wait, but that can't be right because the problem is asking for the coefficient, so maybe I'm misunderstanding the question. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, considering all possible terms, but the question is a bit ambiguous. Wait, no, the problem is specifically asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would be the sum of all coefficients where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2 and 2, respectively, regardless of the exponents of \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would be the coefficient from \\(A\\) times the sum of all coefficients from \\(B\\). Because each term in \\(A\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(B\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^k\\) in \\(B\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would be the sum of all coefficients where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any power of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(B\\). But wait, the sum of all coefficients in \\(B\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), so \\(\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times 64, which is 384. Wait, that seems high. Let me check that again. Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term in the expansion. But in the product, each term in \\(A\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(B\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(A\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(B\\), because each term in \\(A\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(B\\). So, if I let \\(C = \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), then the sum of the coefficients in \\(C\\) is \\(C(1) = (1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\(A \\times B\\) would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(A\\) times the sum of coefficients in \\(B\\), which is 6 times 64, so 384. Wait, that makes sense. So, the coefficient is 384. Let me verify that again. Alternatively, maybe I should think of it as the product of the two expansions, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Since the sum of coefficients in \\(C\\) is 64, then 6 times 64 is indeed 384. So, I think that's the answer. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, but I think the way the problem is phrased, it's the entire expression, so it's 384. Wait, but let me check if that's correct. Let me consider that when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in one polynomial is multiplied by the sum of all terms in the other polynomial. So, in this case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(A\\) is 6, and the sum of all coefficients in \\(B\\) is 64, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 * 64 = 384. That seems correct. Alternatively, if I were to expand both expressions and collect like terms, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would indeed be 6 multiplied by each term in \\(B\\), so the total coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(B\\), which is 64. So, 6 * 64 = 384. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 384. Let me just make sure I didn't make a mistake in calculating the sum of coefficients in \\(B\\). The sum of coefficients in \\(B\\) is when \\(c = 1\\), so \\(\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). That's correct. And the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(A\\) is 6, which is correct because \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). So, 6 * 64 = 384. I think that's the right answer.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break down the problem into two parts using the binomial theorem.\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term with \\(a^2b^2\\) occurs when \\(k = 2\\):\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} a^{2}b^{2} = 6a^2b^2\n   \\]\n   So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\n2. **Consider the second part \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   The sum of all coefficients in this expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\):\n   \\[\n   \\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\n   \\]\n\n3. **Combine the results:**\n   Since each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the coefficient from the first part (6) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients from the second part (64):\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 64 = 384\n   \\]\n\n**Final Answer:** \\(\\boxed{384}\\)"

    "text": " So, I need to find the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2. That would be when \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). So, the coefficient for that term would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Let me compute that. \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient from the first part is 6, and the term is \\(6a^2b^2\\). \n\nNow, the second part of the expression is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I need to expand this as well, but wait, how does this relate to \\(a^2b^2\\)? Oh, wait, I think I might have misunderstood the problem. It says the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression. So, that means I have to multiply the two expansions together: \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are different variables, the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) won't interact with the terms involving \\(c\\) when multiplied. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), right? Wait, no, that can't be right. Because when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. But since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are different variables, the only way to get a term with \\(a^2b^2\\) is to take the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part and multiply it by any term from the second part. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would mean that we're only considering the part of the expansion where the variables are \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. Wait, but in the product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), so each of those would contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times something involving \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which I think is referring to the coefficient in the entire expansion, treating \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) as separate variables. So, in that case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the same as the coefficient in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but actually, no, that's not quite right. Wait, no, when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each polynomial. But in this case, since the variables are different, the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) don't interact with those involving \\(c\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial would be multiplied by every term in the second polynomial, each contributing a factor of \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which I think is the sum of all the coefficients from the second polynomial multiplied by the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial. Wait, but that doesn't make sense because the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would have a coefficient that's multiplied by each term in the second expansion, leading to terms like \\(6a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(6a^2b^2c^4\\), etc. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually be the sum of all the coefficients from the second expansion, because each term in the second expansion contributes to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when multiplied by \\(6a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nWait, let me think again. The sum of the coefficients in a polynomial is found by plugging in 1 for all variables. So, for \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the sum of the coefficients would be when \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of the coefficients is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 times 64, which is 384. But wait, that seems too straightforward. Let me check that again.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), treating \\(c\\) as another variable. So, in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would come from taking \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part and any term from the second part. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in the second expansion. Because each term in the second expansion contributes to the coefficient when multiplied by \\(6a^2b^2\\). So, as I thought earlier, the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 64, so 6 times 64 is 384. \n\nWait, but let me make sure. Another way to think about it is that when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each polynomial. But in this case, since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are different variables, the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is to take \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first polynomial and any term from the second polynomial. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial. Because each term in the second polynomial contributes a factor that multiplies the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. So, that's 6 times 64, which is 384. \n\nWait, but let me double-check the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). If I set \\(c = 1\\), then it's \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, that's correct. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of it as the entire expression being a product of two polynomials, and the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just the product of the coefficients from each part, but that doesn't seem right because the second part isn't a single term. Wait, no, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the sum over all possible ways to get \\(a^2b^2\\) from the product. But since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are only in the first polynomial, the only way is to take \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first and any term from the second. So, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 64. So, 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not missing anything. Is there a possibility that the second polynomial could contribute to the exponents of \\(a\\) or \\(b\\)? No, because the second polynomial is in terms of \\(c\\) only. So, the variables \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are only present in the first polynomial. Therefore, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) can only come from the first polynomial, and it's multiplied by every term in the second polynomial. So, each term in the second polynomial contributes to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when multiplied by 6. Therefore, the total coefficient is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 64. So, 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me consider another approach. Maybe I can expand both polynomials and look for the term \\(a^2b^2\\). But that might be more complicated. Alternatively, since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and the variables are separate, perhaps I can treat the two polynomials as independent and just multiply their coefficients. But that's not exactly correct because the second polynomial has multiple terms, each contributing to the coefficient when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\).\n\nWait, another way: The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is equal to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because each term in the second polynomial contributes its coefficient when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). So, that's 6 times 64, which is 384. So, I think that's the answer.\n\nBut let me just verify once more. The sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is indeed 64 because when \\(c = 1\\), it's \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me check if that's correct. Let me think of a simpler case. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). The coefficient of \\(a^2b^0\\) would be \\(\\dbinom{2}{2} = 1\\) from the first part, and the sum of coefficients in the second part is \\(1 + 1 = 2\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) in the product would be 1 * 2 = 2. Let me expand it: \\((a + b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2\\). \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right) = c + 1/c\\). Multiplying them: \\(a^2c + a^2/c + 2abc + 2ab/c + b^2c + b^2/c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) is indeed \\(c + 1/c\\), which when considering coefficients (treating c as a variable), the coefficient would be the sum of the coefficients, which is 2. So, that works. So, in that case, it's 1 * 2 = 2. So, applying the same logic, in the original problem, it's 6 * 64 = 384. So, I think that's correct.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 384.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me think of another way. Maybe I can consider the entire expression as a product of two polynomials and find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) by considering all possible products that result in \\(a^2b^2\\). But since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are only in the first polynomial, the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) is to take \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first and any term from the second. So, the coefficient is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 64. So, 6 * 64 = 384. That seems consistent.\n\nI think I've thought through this enough. The coefficient should be 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplying it by the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The sum of the coefficients in the second polynomial is found by evaluating it at \\(c = 1\\), yielding \\(2^6 = 64\\). Thus, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n\\boxed{384}"

    "text": " So, I need to find the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2. That would be when \\(4 - k = 2\\) for \\(a\\), which means \\(k = 2\\). So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Let me calculate that: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient is 6. \n\nBut wait, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I also have to consider the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Do I need to expand that as well? Hmm, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\), so maybe the coefficient I found earlier, 6, is the coefficient in the entire expression because when I multiply by something else, it's just 6 times whatever the coefficient from the second part is, but since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), maybe the coefficient from the second part is 1? Wait, no, that doesn't make sense. Let me think again.\n\nWait, actually, when you multiply two expressions together, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression. But in this case, we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\). So, does that mean that the coefficient from the second part is just 1, because any term in the second expansion that doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\) would be the constant term? But wait, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) doesn't have a constant term because all the exponents of \\(c\\) will be even numbers, right? Wait, let me check that.\n\nWait, no, actually, in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, the exponent of \\(c\\) is \\(6 - 2k\\). For this to be a constant term, the exponent should be zero. So, \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which implies \\(k = 3\\). So, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\), which is 20. So, that means in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the constant term is 20. So, when we multiply the two expansions together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by the constant term 20 from the second part. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression will be 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the second part), which is 120. \n\nWait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake here. So, the coefficient from the first part is 6, and the coefficient from the second part that doesn't involve \\(c\\) is 20, so when we multiply them, it's 6 * 20 = 120. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120. Is that right? Hmm, let me think again. Alternatively, maybe I should consider that the entire expression is the product of two expansions, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient in the first expansion times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion. Since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), it's just the product of those two coefficients. So, yeah, 6 * 20 = 120. That seems correct.\n\nWait, but another way to think about it is that when you multiply two polynomials, each term from the first polynomial gets multiplied by each term from the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6a^2b^2, and in the second part, the term that's 20 is the constant term, so when you multiply them, you get 6 * 20 * a^2b^2, which is 120a^2b^2. So, yes, the coefficient is 120.\n\nWait, but let me check if there's another approach. Maybe using multinomial coefficients or something else, but I think the approach I took is correct. Let me just recap: I found the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then found the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20, and then multiplied them together to get 120. That seems to make sense.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think about the entire expression as a product and see if there's a way that \\(a^2b^2\\) could come from other terms, but I don't think so because \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are only in the first part, and \\(c\\) is only in the second part. So, \\(a^2b^2\\) can't be affected by the \\(c\\) terms. So, yeah, I think 120 is the correct coefficient.\n\nWait, but just to be thorough, let me actually compute the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) to make sure I didn't make a mistake there. So, using the binomial theorem, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, when \\(k = 3\\), the exponent is \\(6 - 6 = 0\\), so that term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, yes, that's correct. So, the constant term is indeed 20.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the answer should be 120.\n\nWait, but let me check if I considered all possible contributions. Since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is to take the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part and the constant term from the second part. There are no other terms in the first part that would contribute to \\(a^2b^2\\), because all other terms involve \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) raised to different powers, and similarly, in the second part, only the constant term doesn't involve \\(c\\). So, yes, I think 120 is correct.\n\nI think I've thought this through enough. So, the coefficient is 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break down the problem into two parts using the binomial theorem.\n\nFirst, we consider the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\). Using the binomial theorem, we have:\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n\\]\nWe need the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2, which occurs when \\(k = 2\\). The coefficient for this term is:\n\\[\n\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\n\\]\n\nNext, we consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem, we have:\n\\[\n\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n\\]\nWe need the constant term, which occurs when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. This happens when \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), so \\(k = 3\\). The coefficient for this term is:\n\\[\n\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\n\\]\n\nSince the term \\(a^2b^2\\) does not involve \\(c\\), the coefficient in the entire expression is the product of the coefficients from the two expansions:\n\\[\n6 \\times 20 = 120\n\\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

But wait, the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Hmm, does that affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)? Well, I think so because when you multiply two expressions together, each term from the first expression gets multiplied by each term from the second. But since I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), maybe I don't need to consider the terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) because \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables. Let me think. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), right? Because the second part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which only involves \\(c\\). So when I multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by any term from the second expansion, it'll be \\(a^2b^2\\) times something with \\(c\\). But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and \\(c\\) is another variable, I think the coefficient remains 6 because the \\(c\\) terms don't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. So, does that mean the coefficient is just 6? Wait, but maybe I'm missing something. Let me check again. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So when I expand this, each term in the expansion will be a product of a term from the first binomial and a term from the second binomial. So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I need to consider all possible ways that \\(a^2b^2\\) can be multiplied by terms from the second expansion. But since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), the multiplication by terms involving \\(c\\) doesn't change the exponent of \\(a\\) or \\(b\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression will just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that doesn't make sense because the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the entire expansion of the second part, which is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not considering \\(c\\). Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again. Perhaps the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, in other words, when you multiply the two expressions, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by every term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is 6 times the sum of the coefficients of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that seems too large. Alternatively, maybe the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, considering all possible terms, but that would involve considering the coefficients from both expansions. Hmm, perhaps I should approach this differently. Let me consider that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, since \\((a + b)^4\\) contributes 6 to the coefficient, and the other part contributes its entire expansion, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all terms in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that would be 6 times the sum of coefficients, which is 6 times \\(2^6\\) because each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) has coefficients that are binomial coefficients, and the sum of the coefficients is when we set \\(c = 1\\), so \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, 6 times 64 is 384. But that seems too big. Wait, but I'm not sure if that's the right approach. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not considering \\(c\\). So perhaps the coefficient is 6 multiplied by the sum of the coefficients of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 2^6 = 6 * 64 = 384. But I'm not sure if that's correct because the problem might not be considering the entire expansion but just the coefficient in the product. Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me think again. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), and when multiplied by the entire second part, it's just \\(6a^2b^2 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that's a polynomial, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually be a polynomial in \\(c\\), not a single number. Wait, but the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so maybe it's just 6, because the other part doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the entire product and wants the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384. But I'm not entirely sure. Let me try a different approach. Let me consider that the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). If I want the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I can think of it as taking the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part and multiplying it by every term from the second part. So, the coefficient would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the entire expansion of the second part. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would make the coefficient a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the problem is just asking for a numerical coefficient. Hmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, perhaps the problem is considering the entire product and wants the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), because each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) has a coefficient, and when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), it would contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. The sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), so \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 * 64 = 384. But I'm not entirely confident about this approach. Alternatively, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and the second part doesn't affect it because it's multiplied by other variables. But that seems too simplistic. Let me think again. When you have two polynomials multiplied together, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum of the products of the coefficients of terms whose variables multiply to give that specific term. In this case, since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are in the first polynomial and \\(c\\) is in the second, the variables are separate. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial multiplied by the entire second polynomial. So, the coefficient would be 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that's a polynomial, not a single number. Therefore, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the powers of \\(c\\), which would mean summing over all possible coefficients from the second polynomial. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is just considering the first part, so the coefficient is 6. I'm a bit confused. Let me check another way. Let me expand both parts separately and see how they multiply. The first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), expands to \\(a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). The second part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), expands to \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(1/c\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, each term in the second expansion is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\) for \\(k\\) from 0 to 6. Now, when I multiply the two expansions together, each term from the first will be multiplied by each term from the second. So, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, resulting in \\(6a^2b^2 \\times \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). Therefore, in the product, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(6 \\times \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), the coefficient itself is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem doesn't specify any particular power of \\(c\\), so perhaps it's just asking for the coefficient as a polynomial, which would be \\(6 \\times \\left(c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15/c^2 + 6/c^4 + 1/c^6\\right)\\). But that seems too detailed, and the problem is likely expecting a numerical coefficient. Alternatively, maybe the problem is considering the entire product and wants the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without any restriction on the powers of \\(c\\). In that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. Wait, that makes sense because when you set \\(c = 1\\), the second expansion becomes \\(2^6 = 64\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when \\(c = 1\\) would be 6 * 64 = 384. But I'm not sure if that's the correct approach. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and the second part doesn't affect it. But that seems too simple. Let me think again. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. Since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the same as in the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the entire second expansion. But that would make the coefficient a polynomial, which doesn't seem right. Alternatively, maybe the problem is expecting the coefficient to be 6, because the second part doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. Hmm, I'm a bit stuck. Let me try to see if there's another way to approach this. Maybe I can consider that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part. So, that would be 6 * (sum of coefficients in second part). The sum of coefficients in the second part is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient would be 6 * 64 = 384. So, I think that's the answer. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. When multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion is \\(2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\(\\boxed{384}\\)."

Because substituting \\(c = 1\\) gives us the sum of the coefficients. So, let's compute that. \\(\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = (1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 * 64 = 384. Wait, is that correct? Let me check again. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 64. So, when you multiply them, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, so the total coefficient would be 6 * 64 = 384. Hmm, that seems high, but maybe it's correct. Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Maybe the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which would indeed be 6 times the sum of coefficients in the second part. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only considering the term where \\(c\\) is raised to a certain power, but since it's not specified, I think it's safe to assume that it's considering all possible powers of \\(c\\), so the coefficient is 384. Wait, but let me think again. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), meaning the term where \\(c\\) cancels out. That would make sense too because otherwise, the coefficient would depend on \\(c\\). So, maybe I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\) in the product. That would be a more precise interpretation. So, in that case, I would need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and multiply it by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part, which is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, let's compute that. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) can be done using the binomial theorem as well. So, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(1/c\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, we need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, which occurs when \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), so \\(k = 3\\). So, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\) is \\(\\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 * 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire product is 6 * 20 = 120. Hmm, that seems more reasonable. So, perhaps I misinterpreted the problem earlier, thinking it was asking for the sum over all \\(c\\) terms, but actually, it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), which would include all possible powers of \\(c\\), but that would make the coefficient a sum of terms involving \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because coefficients are constants. So, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), meaning the constant term with respect to \\(c\\). That makes more sense. So, in that case, the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120. Let me verify that again. So, in the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. In the second part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Therefore, when you multiply these two parts together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part, including the constant term \\(20c^0\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120. Wait, but the problem didn't specify anything about \\(c\\), so maybe I'm supposed to consider all possible terms involving \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). But in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. But that would mean the coefficient is 384, which is a constant, but in reality, the expression would have terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) with different coefficients depending on \\(k\\). So, perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), i.e., the term where \\(c\\) is canceled out. So, in that case, the answer would be 120. Let me check online or think if there's a standard approach to such problems. Typically, when asked for the coefficient of a term in a product of two expressions, unless specified otherwise, it's usually referring to the term where the variables in the second expression cancel out, making it a constant term. So, in this case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, I think the correct answer is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6. Next, we find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20. Multiplying these together gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\boxed{120}."

So, the coefficient here would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\), right? Let me calculate that. \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. \n\nBut wait, the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, does that affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)? Hmm, I think it does because when you multiply two expressions, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I don't need to worry about the other variables, \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), because they won't affect the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). So, maybe the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) remains the same as in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, regardless of what's happening in the second part. \n\nWait, but that doesn't seem right. Because when you multiply two expressions, the coefficients multiply as well. So, perhaps I need to consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) as well and see if any terms affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Let me think. So, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When we multiply these, each term from \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), any terms from the second expansion that involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\) won't affect the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) will be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, no, that's not correct because when you multiply two expressions, the coefficients add up, but in this case, since we're looking for a specific term \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient would just be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't make sense because the terms involving \\(c\\) would be separate. Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the entire expression is a product of two independent expansions, and since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is simply the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But no, that's not right because the sum of coefficients in the second expansion would be when \\(c = 1\\), but here we're dealing with variables. Wait, maybe I'm confusing something. Let me approach it differently. \n\nLet me denote \\(E = (a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). We need the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(E\\). Since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are only in the first part, and \\(c\\) is only in the second part, when we expand \\(E\\), the terms involving \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), the coefficient will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, that doesn't seem right because the expansion of the second part will have multiple terms, each with their own coefficients, and when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), each will contribute to the overall coefficient. But actually, since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term independent of \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(E\\) will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that's not correct because when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(E\\) would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nWait, but that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion. Let me check that. The sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\). So, substituting \\(c = 1\\), we get \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of the coefficients is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(E\\) would be 6 * 64 = 384. But wait, that seems too straightforward. Is that correct?\n\nWait, let me think again. When you have two polynomials multiplied together, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum of the products of the coefficients of terms whose variables multiply to give that specific term. But in this case, \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), so when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But since the second expansion includes terms with \\(c^6\\), \\(c^4\\), etc., all the way down to \\(c^{-6}\\), each of these will multiply \\(a^2b^2\\), but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), the coefficient will be the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the entire sum of the coefficients from the second part. Because each term in the second expansion contributes a coefficient that multiplies \\(a^2b^2\\). \n\nSo, yes, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 (from the first part) multiplied by the sum of the coefficients in the second part, which is 64, giving 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nWait, but let me verify this with another approach. Let's expand \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem. So, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(1/c\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). The sum of the coefficients is when \\(c = 1\\), so as before, it's 2^6 = 64. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nBut wait, another way to think about it is that when you multiply two expressions, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, each of which has its own coefficient. So, the total coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 (from the first part) times the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which is 64, giving 384. \n\nAlternatively, if I didn't realize that, I might have thought that only the constant term in the second expansion affects the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but that's not the case because even terms with \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\) would still multiply \\(a^2b^2\\), but since we're only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), all those terms contribute their coefficients to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion is indeed 64, so the total coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nWait, but let me check if that's correct by considering a simpler case. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^1 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, expanding, we get \\(a c + a/c + b c + b/c\\). The coefficient of \\(a\\) would be \\(c + 1/c\\), which is the sum of coefficients in the second expansion. Similarly, the coefficient of \\(b\\) would be the same. So, in that case, the coefficient of \\(a\\) is indeed the sum of coefficients in the second expansion, which is 2. So, in the original problem, since the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6, and the sum of coefficients in the second part is 64, the total coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nWait, but let me think again. If I have \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) when expanded has terms like \\(c^6, c^4, c^2, 1, c^{-2}, c^{-4}, c^{-6}\\), each with their own coefficients. So, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each of these terms, but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), each multiplication by a term in the second expansion adds its coefficient to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the total coefficient is indeed 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. Another way to look at it is that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is equal to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), because each term in the second expansion contributes its coefficient to the product term \\(a^2b^2\\). So, yes, that makes sense. \n\nAlternatively, if I were to think of the entire expression as a product of two polynomials, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for any \\(k\\) would be the product of the coefficients from each part. But since we're only interested in \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\), we have to sum over all possible \\(k\\), which effectively means multiplying the coefficient from the first part by the sum of all coefficients from the second part. \n\nTherefore, I think the correct coefficient is 384. But let me just verify this with another approach. Let me consider that the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nWait, but let me think about it differently. Suppose I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = (1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). Then, the expression becomes \\((a + b)^4 \\times 64\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in this would be 6 * 64 = 384, which matches what I found earlier. \n\nAlternatively, if I set \\(c = t\\), then \\(\\left(t + 1/t\\right)^6\\) has a sum of coefficients when \\(t = 1\\), which is 64. So, yes, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not confusing anything. If I have two polynomials \\(P(a, b)\\) and \\(Q(c)\\), then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(P(a, b) \\times Q(c)\\) is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(P(a, b)\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(Q(c)\\), because each term in \\(Q(c)\\) is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), contributing their coefficients to the overall coefficient. \n\nSo, in this case, \\(P(a, b) = (a + b)^4\\) and \\(Q(c) = \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(P(a, b)\\) is 6, and the sum of coefficients in \\(Q(c)\\) is 64, so the total coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nI think that makes sense. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is 384.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break down the problem into two parts:\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term \\(a^2b^2\\) occurs when \\(k = 2\\), so its coefficient is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\n   \\]\n\n2. **Consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   The sum of the coefficients in this expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives:\n   \\[\n   \\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\n   \\]\n\n3. **Combine the results:**\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) and the sum of the coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 64 = 384\n   \\]\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{384}\\)."

So, the coefficient from the first part is 6. Now, the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient I'm looking for is 6 times whatever comes from the second part. But wait, actually, the problem is about the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). But the second part of the expression involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, does that affect the \\(a^2b^2\\) term? Hmm, let me think. The second part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which when expanded, will have terms involving different powers of \\(c\\), but since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of the second part. But the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). Wait, no, actually, the entire expression is a product, so the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which I think implies that we're considering the entire expression, so perhaps the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part, meaning that the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion. But that doesn't make sense because the coefficient should be a single number. Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Let me read the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" Oh, wait, perhaps the question is considering all terms, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in other words, we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for any integer \\(k\\), but the problem just says \\(a^2b^2\\), so maybe the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of the second part. But that doesn't make sense because the coefficient would then be a polynomial in \\(c\\), but the problem seems to be asking for a numerical coefficient. Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when we multiply these out, each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), where \\(k\\) can be various exponents. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which I think means the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, that would mean we're summing up all the coefficients from the second part and multiplying by 6. Wait, that doesn't seem right either. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, so the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion. Wait, but that would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me check: the sum of the coefficients in a polynomial is found by setting all variables to 1. So, if I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = (2)^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of the coefficients in the second part is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times 64, which is 384. Wait, but that seems too straightforward. Let me make sure I'm not making a mistake. Alternatively, maybe I'm supposed to consider that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the same as the coefficient in the first part, multiplied by the entire second expansion, so the coefficient would be 6 times the entire second expansion, but that would mean it's a polynomial, not a number. So, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating \\(c\\) as a variable, but that doesn't make sense because the coefficient would then be a polynomial in \\(c\\). Hmm, maybe I'm missing something. Wait, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, considering all possible terms, which would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the expansion of the second part. But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, but the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, so maybe I'm misunderstanding the question. Wait, perhaps the problem is written as \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), and it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, which would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second part. As I thought earlier, the sum of the coefficients in the second part is 64, so 6 times 64 is 384. So, the coefficient would be 384. But let me double-check that approach. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, but without considering \\(c\\), so perhaps it's 6 times the entire expansion of the second part, but that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, which doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating, and the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion of the first part, which is 6, and the second part doesn't affect it because it's multiplied by other variables. But that doesn't seem right because the entire expression is a product, so the coefficient would be 6 times the expansion of the second part. Wait, perhaps the problem is written as \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), and we're to consider the product as a whole, so when we multiply the two expansions, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 times 64, which is 384. So, I think that's the answer. But let me make sure I'm not making a mistake. Alternatively, perhaps I should expand both parts separately and then multiply them. Let's see: \\((a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. Now, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) can be expanded using the binomial theorem as well. The expansion would be \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, each term in this expansion is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\) for \\(k = 0\\) to \\(6\\). Now, when we multiply the two expansions together, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, resulting in \\(6a^2b^2 \\times \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\) for each \\(k\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be \\(6 \\times \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k}\\), because each term in the second expansion contributes its coefficient to the product. Wait, but \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k}\\) is equal to \\(2^6 = 64\\), as I thought earlier. So, the coefficient would be \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 384. So, I think that's the correct answer. Wait, but let me make sure. Alternatively, maybe I'm supposed to consider that the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, but since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then yes, it's 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, so 6 times 64 is 384. So, I think that's the answer. But just to be thorough, let me think again. The problem is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). We need the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). The first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), has a term \\(6a^2b^2\\). The second part, when expanded, is a sum of terms involving different powers of \\(c\\). When we multiply the two expansions, each term in the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part. So, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, which are \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\\) for \\(k\\) from 0 to 6. Therefore, the product will have terms like \\(6 \\times \\dbinom{6}{k}a^2b^2c^{6 - 2k}\\) for each \\(k\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is \\(6 \\times \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k}\\), which is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). So, yes, I think 384 is the correct coefficient. Wait, but just to make sure, let me calculate \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k}\\). Since \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{n} \\dbinom{n}{k} = 2^n\\), so for \\(n = 6\\), it's \\(2^6 = 64\\). So, that's correct. Therefore, the coefficient is 6 times 64, which is 384. So, the answer is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6. Then, since the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\boxed{384}."

    "text": " So, I need to find the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) appears in this expansion. That should correspond to when the exponent on \\(a\\) is 2 and the exponent on \\(b\\) is 2. Since \\(a^{4 - k}b^k\\), then \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). So, the term is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} a^{2}b^{2}\\). Let me compute \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). That's \\(4! / (2!2!) = (24)/(2*2) = 24/4 = 6\\). So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6. \n\nNow, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I think that the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), will also expand using the binomial theorem. But wait, since we're multiplying two expressions together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression will be the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part, right? Or wait, no, actually, when you multiply two polynomials, each term from the first polynomial gets multiplied by each term from the second. But in this case, the first part is \\((a + b)^4\\) and the second part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, actually, the variables are different: the first part involves \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), while the second part involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). Therefore, when we multiply them together, the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from those involving \\(c\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), so when we multiply, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would just be the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the entire second part. But wait, that doesn't make sense because the second part is a sum of terms involving \\(c\\). Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Let me think again.\n\nWait, no, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, perhaps I need to consider all possible terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) appears, multiplied by any combination of terms from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term in the first part, and the second part is independent, maybe the coefficient is just 6 times the sum of all terms in the second expansion. Wait, but that would be 6 times the entire expansion, which would be 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that can't be right because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would include any term from the second expansion. Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\).\" Hmm, so maybe the problem is actually considering all possible terms, including the \\(c\\) terms, but only looking at the \\(a^2b^2\\) part. Wait, but that doesn't make much sense because the \\(c\\) terms are separate. Alternatively, maybe the problem is considering the entire expression as a single polynomial and wants the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. Wait, that might make sense. So, perhaps the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion, because each term in the second expansion is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), so the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) across all terms would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion. Let me check that.\n\nWait, the second part is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Let me expand that using the binomial theorem. So, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(1/c\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m - m} = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, each term in the expansion is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). The sum of all coefficients in this expansion would be when we set \\(c = 1\\). So, substituting \\(c = 1\\), we get \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion is 64. Therefore, if we consider the entire expression, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, so the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 (from the first part) multiplied by the sum of the coefficients in the second part, which is 64. Therefore, the coefficient would be 6 * 64 = 384. Hmm, that seems high, but let me think again.\n\nWait, no, perhaps I'm making a mistake here. Because when you multiply two expressions, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each expression. But in this case, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expression is being multiplied by every term in the second expression. So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^k\\) for some \\(k\\) would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^k\\) in the second expression. But if the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, then perhaps the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expression, which is 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, maybe the problem is considering the entire product as a single polynomial and wants the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which would be 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but that seems like a lot. Let me double-check. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some \\(k\\), but the problem just says \\(a^2b^2\\), so maybe it's considering all possible \\(c\\) terms, so the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating, and the problem is simply looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and the second part doesn't affect it because it's multiplied by other variables. But that doesn't seem right because when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second, so the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me think again. If I have \\((a + b)^4\\) which gives me terms with \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) which gives me terms with \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), then when I multiply them together, the variables are separate. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is multiplied by every term in the second part, which are all terms with \\(c\\). So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion. Because each term in the second expansion is a coefficient times a power of \\(c\\), so when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), it becomes 6 times each coefficient times the respective power of \\(c\\). But if we're just looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then it's 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but that seems too straightforward. Let me check with a smaller example to see if this makes sense. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, expanding \\((a + b)^2\\) gives \\(a^2 + 2ab + b^2\\). Expanding \\((c + 1/c)^1\\) gives \\(c + 1/c\\). Now, multiplying them together, the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) would be 1 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is \\(1 + 1 = 2\\), so 1 * 2 = 2. Similarly, the coefficient of \\(ab\\) would be 2 times 2 = 4, and the coefficient of \\(b^2\\) would be 1 times 2 = 2. So, in this case, it works as expected. So, applying the same logic, in our problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me make sure. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the entire expression as a single expansion and wants the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, meaning that the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is indeed 64, so 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm misunderstanding, and the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), that is, the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2, and the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0. In that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion. Let me check that.\n\nIn the second expansion, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term where \\(c^0\\) occurs is when the exponent from \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) cancel out. So, \\(c^{6 - 2m} = c^0\\), which implies \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), so \\(m = 3\\). So, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it would be 6 * 20 = 120. But the problem just says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", so I think it's more likely that it's considering all possible \\(c\\) terms, so the coefficient would be 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because in the problem statement, it's written as \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, perhaps the variables are separate, so the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would have a coefficient that's the product of the coefficients from each part. But in this case, since we're looking for \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), maybe the coefficient is just 6, because the second part is separate. But that doesn't seem right because when you multiply polynomials, each term from the first is multiplied by each term from the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, so the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) across all terms would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me check with the smaller example again. If I have \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\), then the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) is 1 times (1 + 1) = 2, which is correct because the expansion would include \\(a^2c\\) and \\(a^2 \\times 1/c\\), so the coefficient for \\(a^2\\) is indeed 2. Similarly, the coefficient for \\(ab\\) would be 2 times (1 + 1) = 4, and for \\(b^2\\) it's 1 times 2 = 2. So, in this case, the coefficients are indeed the coefficients from the first expansion multiplied by the sum of the coefficients from the second expansion. Therefore, applying that logic, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given problem would be 6 times 64, which is 384.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit unsure because sometimes when variables are different, people might consider the coefficient as just the coefficient from the first part, ignoring the second part. But in reality, when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second, so the coefficients do combine in that way. So, I think 384 is the correct answer.\n\nWait, but let me make sure. Let me compute the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion again. \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). The sum of coefficients is when \\(c = 1\\), so \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, yes, that's correct. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^4\\) times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). If I expand both, the product will have terms like \\(a^kb^{4 - k} \\times c^m \\times (1/c)^n\\), where \\(m + n = 6\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, that would mean that for each term where \\(a^2b^2\\) appears, it's multiplied by some power of \\(c\\), but the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) across all those terms would be the coefficient from the first part times the sum of the coefficients from the second part. So, that would be 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem had asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion, which is 20, giving 120. But since it's just \\(a^2b^2\\), I think it's 384.\n\nWait, but perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me try to think differently. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, in the product, each term from the first expansion is multiplied by each term from the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first expansion, and it's multiplied by every term in the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) times each term in the second expansion is 6 times each coefficient in the second expansion. So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^k\\) in the second expansion. But if we're just looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, then it's 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64. Therefore, the coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but another way to think about it is that when you have two independent variables, \\(a, b\\) and \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the product of the coefficients from each part. But in this case, since \\(a, b\\) and \\(c\\) are separate, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just the coefficient from the first part, 6, times the entire second expansion, because each term in the second expansion is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). But that would mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the entire second expansion, which is a polynomial, not a single coefficient. That doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, not a polynomial. Therefore, perhaps the correct interpretation is that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, so 384.\n\nWait, but let me try to compute the entire product and see. Let me compute \\((a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). The second part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), expands to \\(c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15/c^2 + 6/c^4 + 1/c^6\\). Now, when I multiply these two, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, \\(a^2b^2 \\times c^6\\) gives a term with coefficient 6 * 1 = 6, \\(a^2b^2 \\times 6c^4\\) gives 6 * 6 = 36, \\(a^2b^2 \\times 15c^2\\) gives 6 * 15 = 90, \\(a^2b^2 \\times 20\\) gives 6 * 20 = 120, and so on for each term. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^6\\) is 6, \\(a^2b^2c^4\\) is 36, \\(a^2b^2c^2\\) is 90, \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is 120, \\(a^2b^2c^{-2}\\) is 90, \\(a^2b^2c^{-4}\\) is 36, and \\(a^2b^2c^{-6}\\) is 6. So, each of these terms has a coefficient of 6 times the respective coefficient from the second expansion. Therefore, if we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), it would be the sum of all these coefficients, which is 6 + 36 + 90 + 120 + 90 + 36 + 6. Let me add these up:\n\n6 + 36 = 42\n\n42 + 90 = 132\n\n132 + 120 = 252\n\n252 + 90 = 342\n\n342 + 36 = 378\n\n378 + 6 = 384\n\nSo, the total coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) across all powers of \\(c\\) is 384. Therefore, the answer is 384.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because sometimes when you have separate variables, you might not consider the sum across all powers of another variable. But in this case, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so I think it's correct to sum across all possible \\(c\\) terms, leading to 384.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem had asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), it would have been 6 * 20 = 120, as I thought earlier. But since it's just \\(a^2b^2\\), the coefficient is 384.\n\nSo, to recap:\n\n1. Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is 6.\n\n2. The second part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), when expanded, has a sum of coefficients equal to 64.\n\n3. Multiply these together: 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 384.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{384}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break down the problem into two parts using the binomial theorem.\n\n1. **Expanding \\((a + b)^4\\)**:\n   Using the binomial theorem, we expand \\((a + b)^4\\) as:\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\), so the coefficient is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} = \\frac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\n   \\]\n\n2. **Expanding \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)**:\n   Using the binomial theorem, we expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) as:\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n   \\]\n   The sum of the coefficients in this expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives:\n   \\[\n   (1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\n   \\]\n\n3. **Combining the results**:\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficient from the first part and the sum of the coefficients from the second part:\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 64 = 384\n   \\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\boxed{384}\\)."

    "text": " So, I need to find the term where \\(a\\) is squared and \\(b\\) is squared. That would be when \\(4 - k = 2\\) for \\(a\\), which means \\(k = 2\\) for \\(b\\). So, the coefficient here is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Let me calculate that. \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient from the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), for the \\(a^2b^2\\) term is 6. \n\nNow, the expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I need to consider how this affects the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait a second, I think I might be overcomplicating things. Since the expression is a product of two separate binomial expansions, the terms from each part multiply together. But the term \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), so maybe the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But wait, no, that can't be right because when you multiply two polynomials, each term from the first polynomial is multiplied by each term from the second. But in this case, since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), the only way it would appear in the product is if it's multiplied by the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Because if you have \\(a^2b^2\\) times something involving \\(c\\), it would be \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or similar, but since we're only looking for \\(a^2b^2\\), the exponent on \\(c\\) must be zero. So, I think I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) and then multiply it by the coefficient 6 from the first part. \n\nLet me check that logic again. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). When expanding, each term from \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term from the second part. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), that means we need to find all the terms in the second expansion that don't involve \\(c\\), because \\(a^2b^2\\) times a term with \\(c\\) would result in a term like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), which isn't the same as \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the only term that contributes to \\(a^2b^2\\) is when the second part is multiplied by the constant term (i.e., the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero). So, I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). \n\nOkay, so let's find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Again, using the binomial theorem, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(1/c\\right)^k\\). Simplifying each term, that's \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} c^{-k} = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, the exponent on \\(c\\) is \\(6 - 2k\\). We want the exponent to be zero, so set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Let me calculate that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20. \n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficients from each part. That is, 6 (from \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\)) multiplied by 20 (the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\)). So, 6 times 20 is 120. \n\nWait, but let me double-check to make sure I didn't make a mistake. So, \\((a + b)^4\\) gives \\(a^2b^2\\) with coefficient 6. \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) gives a constant term 20. Multiplying them together, 6 * 20 = 120. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120. \n\nI think that makes sense. Let me just think again: when you have two separate polynomials multiplied together, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each polynomial. Since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), we're looking for the term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) that doesn't involve \\(c\\), which is the constant term. Then, multiplying those coefficients together gives the final coefficient in the product. Yeah, that seems right. \n\nI don't think I missed anything. So, the final answer should be 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is found by first determining the coefficient in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplying it by the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20. Thus, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\boxed{120}"

    "text": " So, I need to find the term where the powers of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2. That would be when \\(4 - k = 2\\) for \\(a\\), which means \\(k = 2\\). So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Let me calculate that: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\\). So, the coefficient is 6 for \\(a^2b^2\\) in that part.\n\nBut wait, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the second part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I need to consider this part as well because when we multiply the two expansions together, each term from the first expansion will multiply each term from the second expansion. However, the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). That means that the terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) might not affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) because they are separate variables. So, maybe I don't need to worry about the \\(c\\) terms when looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Let me think about that.\n\nSo, if I have \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), and I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), then any term in the expansion of the second part will just be a coefficient multiplied by some power of \\(c\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), I think the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) will just be the coefficient from the first part, multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part, but since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, perhaps I need to consider that the coefficient from the first part is 6, and then multiply it by the sum of all terms in the second expansion. But wait, no, that doesn't make sense because each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually be 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. But wait, is that correct?\n\nWait, no, that's not quite right. Because when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 (from the first part) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part. But the second part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me find the sum of its coefficients. The sum of the coefficients in a polynomial is found by plugging in 1 for all variables. So, if I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = (1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of the coefficients in the second part is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 64 (sum of coefficients from the second part). So, 6 * 64 = 384. Therefore, the coefficient is 384.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. Let me think again. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), and when we multiply it by the entire second part, each term in the second part will be multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, we can consider that each term in the second part will contribute a coefficient, and the total coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the product of the coefficient from the first part and the sum of the coefficients from the second part. So, yes, that makes sense. So, the coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of it as the entire expression being the product of two polynomials. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all coefficients from the second part, since \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by every term in the second polynomial. Therefore, yes, 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me check if there's another way to approach this. Maybe I can expand both parts and see what happens. Let me try that. First, expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem. As I did before, the expansion is \\(a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6.\n\nNow, the second part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me expand that as well. Using the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the terms are \\(c^6, 6c^4, 15c^2, 20, 15c^{-2}, 6c^{-4}, c^{-6}\\). So, the coefficients are 1, 6, 15, 20, 15, 6, 1 for the respective powers of \\(c\\).\n\nNow, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion gets multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product will be 6 (from \\(a^2b^2\\)) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. Wait, because each term in the second expansion is a coefficient times some power of \\(c\\), but since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), the total coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion.\n\nWait, but the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion is when \\(c = 1\\), which is \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\), as I thought earlier. So, 6 * 64 = 384. So, that confirms it. Therefore, the coefficient is 384.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of it as the product of the two expressions. The first expression is a polynomial in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the second is a polynomial in \\(c\\). Since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are different variables, the terms involving \\(c\\) don't affect the coefficients of terms involving only \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient from the first part times the sum of the coefficients from the second part, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me consider another approach. Suppose I consider the entire expression as a product of two polynomials, then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second polynomial, the coefficients add up. So, yes, that's another way to see it. Therefore, 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but maybe I should also check if there's any other way this could be approached, perhaps by considering generating functions or something else. But I think the approach I've taken is solid. So, I can be confident that the coefficient is 384.\n\nWait, but let me just double-check my calculations. The binomial coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Correct. Then, the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), so \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). Correct. So, 6 * 64 is indeed 384. Therefore, the coefficient is 384.\n\nI think that's the correct answer. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning. So, I can conclude that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is 384.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{384}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break down the problem as follows:\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\), so the coefficient is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\n   \\]\n\n2. **Consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   The sum of the coefficients in this expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\):\n   \\[\n   \\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\n   \\]\n\n3. **Combine the results:**\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficient from the first part and the sum of the coefficients from the second part:\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 64 = 384\n   \\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{384}\\)."

So, I guess the next step is to figure out how this part affects the coefficient. But wait, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), right? So, does that mean that when I multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the coefficient will just be multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)? Hmm, maybe not. Wait, no, because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but it doesn't specify anything about \\(c\\). So, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Wait, no, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression. But since the entire expression is a product of two parts, \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), maybe the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are independent of those involving \\(c\\). So, perhaps when I multiply them, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for the coefficient, not the entire expression.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so perhaps it's considering the product as a whole, and I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. But that doesn't seem right because \\(c\\) is another variable. Maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times some power of \\(c\\), but the problem statement doesn't specify. Wait, no, the problem just says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", so maybe it's considering the entire expression as a polynomial in \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\), and we need to find the coefficient of the term where \\(a\\) is squared, \\(b\\) is squared, and \\(c\\) is to some power. But since the problem doesn't specify a particular power of \\(c\\), perhaps it's considering all possible terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) appears, regardless of the \\(c\\) part. But that seems a bit ambiguous. Alternatively, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\), ignoring the other part. But that can't be right because the problem includes the entire expression. Hmm, I'm a bit confused here.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm supposed to treat the entire expression as a product and find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by any term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But then the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a specific coefficient, not a sum. Alternatively, maybe the problem is considering only the constant term with respect to \\(c\\), so that \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) combine to give a constant, and then we take the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in that constant term. That might make sense. Let me try that approach.\n\nSo, first, I'll find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The constant term would be the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. Using the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, we want the exponent of \\(c\\) to be zero, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which gives \\(m = 3\\). So, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\), which is \\(\\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20.\n\nNow, if I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by the constant term 20, then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 (from \\((a + b)^4\\)) times 20 (the constant term), which is 120. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 120. But wait, let me confirm this because I'm not sure if this is the correct approach. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, so I just need to multiply the coefficients from each part.\n\nWait, but actually, when you have two separate expressions multiplied together, the terms from each are independent. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by every term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean that the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. Therefore, perhaps the problem is implicitly asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times the constant term in \\(c\\), so that the entire term is independent of \\(c\\). That would make sense, as the constant term in \\(c\\) is 20, as I found earlier, so the coefficient would be 6 times 20, which is 120.\n\nWait, but let me think again. If I don't consider the constant term, and instead consider all possible terms, then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But the sum of the coefficients in a polynomial is found by substituting 1 for each variable. So, substituting \\(c = 1\\), we get \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of the coefficients is 64, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times 64, which is 384. But that seems too large, and I don't think that's what the problem is asking for because it's unlikely to have such a large coefficient without specifying.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is only considering the term where \\(c\\) is raised to a specific power, but since it's not specified, maybe it's just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), which would involve summing over all possible \\(c\\) terms. But that would mean that the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. Therefore, I think the correct approach is to consider the constant term in \\(c\\), so that the entire expression is a term independent of \\(c\\), and then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in that term is 6 times 20, which is 120.\n\nWait, but let me check this again. So, if I expand \\((a + b)^4\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) has a coefficient of 6. Then, when I multiply this by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which would involve all terms from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms, that is, the constant term in \\(c\\), then yes, it's 6 times 20, which is 120. Alternatively, if the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, without considering \\(c\\), then it would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which would make the coefficient a polynomial in \\(c\\), but that seems unlikely.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me think again. The problem is: What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, perhaps the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is being considered in the entire expansion, but since \\(c\\) is another variable, the coefficient would actually be a polynomial in \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that seems too broad because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, not a polynomial. Therefore, perhaps the problem is only considering the constant term in \\(c\\), so that the coefficient is 6 times 20, which is 120.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is miswritten, and it's supposed to be \\((a + b + c + 1/c)^4\\), but no, the original problem is \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then the other part is irrelevant because it's multiplied by something else. But that seems unlikely because the problem includes both parts.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider that the entire expression is a product, so when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term is the product of the coefficients from each part. But in this case, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from \\((a + b)^4\\), and the other part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), contributes a term that could be anything. So, perhaps the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which would make the coefficient a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, so maybe I'm misunderstanding the question.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\), which is the constant term. So, that would mean I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 20. So, 6 times 20 is 120. Therefore, the coefficient would be 120.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, without considering \\(c\\), which would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would make the coefficient a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense as a numerical coefficient. Therefore, I think the correct approach is to consider the constant term in \\(c\\), so that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\) is 120.\n\nWait, but let me try to think differently. Maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, that would mean that for each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), I multiply it by the corresponding term in \\((a + b)^4\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) has a coefficient of 6, and it's being multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which would be a polynomial in \\(c\\). But since the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, perhaps it's only interested in the constant term, which would be 6 times 20, which is 120.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and the rest is irrelevant. But that seems unlikely because the problem includes both parts.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me try to write out the expansion. So, \\((a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. Then, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) expands to a polynomial where each term is of the form \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, when I multiply these two expansions together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. Therefore, I think the problem must be asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times the constant term in \\(c\\), which is 20. So, 6 times 20 is 120.\n\nWait, but let me check again. If I consider the entire product, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), so it's 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would make the coefficient a polynomial, not a number. Therefore, perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of \\(c\\), which would mean that it's 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). The sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is found by substituting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\(2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient would be 6 times 64, which is 384. But that seems too high, and I'm not sure if that's what the problem is asking for.\n\nWait, but let me think again. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, perhaps the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is being multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), so the coefficient would be 6 times each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which would make it a polynomial in \\(c\\). But since the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, perhaps it's only interested in the constant term, which is 6 times 20, which is 120.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is considering \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) as separate variables, and it's asking for the coefficient of the term where \\(a\\) is squared, \\(b\\) is squared, and \\(c\\) is raised to some power. But since the problem doesn't specify a particular power of \\(c\\), I think the most reasonable interpretation is that it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), i.e., the constant term in \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient would be 6 times 20, which is 120.\n\nWait, but let me make sure. If I consider the entire product, then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 64, giving 384. But that seems too large, and I think the problem is more likely asking for the coefficient when considering \\(c\\) as well, but perhaps only the constant term. Alternatively, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, regardless of \\(c\\), which would mean 6 times the entire expansion, but that would make the coefficient a polynomial, which doesn't make sense. Therefore, I think the correct approach is to consider the constant term in \\(c\\), so the coefficient is 6 times 20, which is 120.\n\nWait, but let me check one more time. If I have \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), then the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times each coefficient from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which is \\(6 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But since the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, perhaps it's only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), which would be 6 times 20, giving 120. Alternatively, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), then it's 6 times the entire expansion, but that would be a polynomial, not a number. So, I think the correct answer is 120.\n\nWait, but to be absolutely sure, let me calculate the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). As I did earlier, the constant term is when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. So, using the binomial theorem, the general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\times \\left(1/c\\right)^m = \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). Setting \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), we get \\(m = 3\\). So, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times 20, which is 120. So, I think that's the correct answer.\n\nWait, but let me check once more. If I consider \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), then each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) with coefficient 6 is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), so the coefficient becomes 6 times each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But since the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, perhaps it's only interested in the constant term, which is 6 times 20, so 120. Alternatively, if the problem is considering all possible terms, then the coefficient is a polynomial, but I think the problem is expecting a numerical answer, so 120 is the answer.\n\nSo, to recap: The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times the constant term is 6 times 20, which is 120. Therefore, the answer is 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break down the problem into two parts: expanding \\((a + b)^4\\) and considering the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\n1. **Expanding \\((a + b)^4\\):**\n   Using the binomial theorem, we have:\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\), so the coefficient is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\n   \\]\n\n2. **Finding the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   Using the binomial theorem, we expand:\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n   \\]\n   The constant term occurs when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, i.e., \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which gives \\(m = 3\\).

    "text": " So, I need to find the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2. That would be when \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\), right? So, plugging in \\(k = 2\\), the term is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} a^{2}b^{2}\\). The binomial coefficient \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) is calculated as \\(4! / (2! \\cdot (4 - 2)!)\\), which is \\((4 \\times 3 \\times 2!)/(2! \\times 2!)\\), so that's \\((12)/4 = 3\\). So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 3. Okay, so that part I got. Now, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I think the next step is to consider how the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), interacts with the first part. But wait, the question is only about the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). That suggests that maybe the other part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), doesn't affect the coefficients of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), but perhaps it does affect the overall coefficient when multiplied. Wait, no, actually, when you multiply two expressions together, each term in the first expression is multiplied by each term in the second expression. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), we can treat the second part as a constant multiplier for that specific term. Hmm, let me think about that again. Alternatively, maybe I can consider that the entire expression is a product of two polynomials, and I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of what happens with \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). Wait, but actually, in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the variables \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), so when you multiply them, the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) will be multiplied by terms involving \\(c\\). But since the problem is asking only for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), perhaps the terms involving \\(c\\) will just act as scalars when considering the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). That is, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that doesn't seem right because the product would involve all possible combinations of terms from both expansions. Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me clarify: The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). If I want the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), that term would be the term from \\((a + b)^4\\) which is \\(3a^2b^2\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient would be \\(3 \\times\\) the sum of all terms in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, that can't be right because the sum of all terms in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) would be a huge number, but the problem is probably expecting a specific coefficient, not a product involving \\(c\\). Hmm, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Wait, maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning that we're looking for the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2, and the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0. Because otherwise, if we just consider \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), the coefficient would be \\(3 \\times\\) the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which would result in a polynomial in \\(c\\), but the problem is asking for a coefficient, which is a number, not a polynomial. So, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning that the exponents of \\(c\\) must sum to zero. So, in that case, we have to consider both expansions: the \\((a + b)^4\\) and the \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), and find the terms where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2 each, and the exponents of \\(c\\) sum to zero. Therefore, the coefficient would be the product of the coefficients from each part. So, let me approach this step by step.\n\nFirst, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 3, as I found earlier.\n\nNext, in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), we need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\), because when we multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), we want the exponent of \\(c\\) to be zero so that the term is \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). So, let me find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\).\n\nTo do this, I can use the binomial theorem again. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(1/c\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\).\n\nWe want the exponent of \\(c\\) to be zero, so we set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\).\n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\), which is \\(20\\).\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire product is the product of the coefficients from each part, which is \\(3 \\times 20 = 60\\).\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. So, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But we're only interested in the terms where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, because otherwise, the term would have a \\(c\\) component, which we don't want. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part. That makes sense, because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by \\(c^0\\), you get \\(a^2b^2\\), and the coefficients multiply as well.\n\nSo, to recap:\n\n1. Coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 3.\n2. Coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 20.\n3. Multiply these two coefficients together to get 60.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 60.\n\nWait, but let me check if I'm interpreting the problem correctly. The problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", but in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually be multiplied by some power of \\(c\\). So, unless we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), which would be a polynomial in \\(c\\), but that doesn't make much sense. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are squared and \\(c\\) is to the zero power. That seems more likely, and that's what I calculated as 60. So, I think that's the correct approach.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem was just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) without considering the other part, it would be 3, but since the entire expression includes the \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) part, and the problem is asking for \\(a^2b^2\\), it's more precise to consider that we're looking for the coefficient where the exponents of \\(c\\) also sum to zero, making it \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is why we needed to multiply by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part.\n\nWait, but another way to think about it is that when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum of the products of coefficients of terms whose exponents add up to that term. So, in this case, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial is multiplied by every term in the second polynomial. But since the second polynomial is in \\(c\\), the exponents of \\(c\\) in the product would vary. So, if we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), that would mean summing over all possible coefficients from the second polynomial, which would result in a very large coefficient. But that seems unlikely, as the problem is probably expecting a specific numerical coefficient. So, I think the intended interpretation is that we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 60.\n\nLet me just confirm the calculations again.\n\nFirst, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Wait, hold on, earlier I thought it was 3, but now I'm getting 6. Wait, no, no, \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) is 6, right? Because 4 choose 2 is 6. Wait, did I make a mistake earlier? Let me check that again. So, \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 4! / (2! * 2!) = (24)/(2*2) = 24/4 = 6. So, the coefficient is 6, not 3. Oh no, I think I made a mistake earlier. So, that changes things. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, not 3. So, where did I go wrong before? I think I miscalculated the binomial coefficient. So, that was an error on my part. So, the correct coefficient is 6.\n\nThen, in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\), as I calculated before. So, then, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, so earlier I thought the coefficient was 3, but actually, it's 6. So, that changes the final answer to 120. Hmm, so I need to correct that.\n\nLet me go through this again step by step to make sure I don't make any mistakes.\n\nFirst, expanding \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:\n\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^{k}\n\\]\n\nWe are interested in the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2, so \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). Therefore, the term is:\n\n\\[\n\\dbinom{4}{2} a^{2}b^{2} = 6a^2b^2\n\\]\n\nSo, the coefficient is 6.\n\nNext, expanding \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem:\n\n\\[\n\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n\\]\n\nWe need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so:\n\n\\[\n6 - 2k = 0 \\implies k = 3\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the coefficient is:\n\n\\[\n\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\n\\]\n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20.\n\nNow, when we multiply the two expansions together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But since we're interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), we only consider the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, which we found has a coefficient of 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product is:\n\n\\[\n6 \\times 20 = 120\n\\]\n\nWait, so that means the coefficient is 120. But let me make sure I'm not missing anything else. So, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). When we multiply these, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part. However, only the term in the second part with \\(c^0\\) will contribute to the \\(a^2b^2\\) term without any \\(c\\) component. All other terms in the second part will result in a term that includes \\(c\\) raised to some power, which we don't want. Therefore, the only contribution to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) (without any \\(c\\)) is from the \\(c^0\\) term in the second expansion, which is 20. Therefore, multiplying 6 and 20 gives 120.\n\nWait, but let me think again. The problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", not necessarily \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). So, does that mean we're considering all possible terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present, regardless of the exponent of \\(c\\)? If that's the case, then the coefficient would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire sum of the coefficients in the second part. But that would be incorrect because the problem is likely expecting a specific term. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) and not considering the other part at all, but that seems unlikely because the expression is given as the product of two polynomials.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, meaning that it's a coefficient that is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But that would be unusual because coefficients are typically constants, not expressions in other variables. So, I think the intended interpretation is that we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, which would involve all possible exponents of \\(c\\), but that would mean that the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which seems unlikely. So, I think the correct approach is to consider the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Suppose I don't consider the \\(c\\) part at all. Then, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and when multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the coefficient would be 6 times that expansion. But that would mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually be a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. Therefore, the correct interpretation is that we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought the coefficient was 60, but now I'm getting 120. Let me check where I went wrong. Oh, no, I think I made a mistake in the first calculation when I thought the coefficient was 3. Actually, it's 6, so 6 times 20 is 120. So, that's correct.\n\nWait, but let me just make sure. Let me write out the expansions:\n\nFirst, \\((a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6.\n\nSecond, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) expands to:\n\n\\(c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15/c^2 + 6/c^4 + 1/c^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20.\n\nTherefore, when you multiply the two expressions, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nSo, I think that's the correct answer. Therefore, the coefficient is 120.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was 60, but that was because I had miscalculated the binomial coefficient as 3 instead of 6. So, now that I've corrected that, the answer is 120.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of it as the product of the two coefficients, so 6 from the first part and 20 from the second part, giving 120.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So, the final answer should be 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break down the problem into two parts using the binomial theorem.\n\n1. **Expanding \\((a + b)^4\\)**:\n   Using the binomial theorem, the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is:\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   We need the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which occurs when \\(k = 2\\):\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\n   \\]\n   So, the coefficient is 6.\n\n2. **Expanding \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)**:\n   Using the binomial theorem, the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is:\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n   \\]\n   We need the coefficient of \\(c^0\\), which occurs when \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), i.e., \\(k = 3\\):\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{6}{3} c^0 = 20\n   \\]\n   So, the coefficient is 20.\n\n3. **Combining the results**:\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is the product of the coefficients from each part:\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 20 = 120\n   \\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which comes from the first part, the second part can contribute any term, but since we're only looking for \\(a^2b^2\\), the c terms don't affect that. So, perhaps the coefficient is just 6, because when you multiply by the second part, which is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), it doesn't affect the a and b terms. Wait, but that doesn't seem right. Wait, no, actually, I think I'm confusing something. Let me clarify: the expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when you expand both, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the first expansion, and the second expansion will have terms involving c and 1/c. So, when we multiply, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire second expansion, because each term in the second expansion is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). But wait, that would mean the coefficient is 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that's not possible because the coefficient should be a number, not an expression in c. Hmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Wait, perhaps the question is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, considering all the terms. But that doesn't make sense because the entire expression is a product, so the terms would involve both a, b, c, and 1/c. Wait, perhaps the question is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the powers of c. So, in other words, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all terms in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). But that would mean the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by setting c = 1. So, when c = 1, \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). So, does that mean the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times 64, which is 384? Hmm, that seems possible, but I'm not sure if that's what the problem is asking. Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me go back to the problem: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, perhaps the problem is considering the entire expansion, but only looking at terms where the exponents of a and b are 2 each, regardless of the exponents of c. So, in that case, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), so the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the sum of all coefficients from the second part. Because each term in the second part is a coefficient times some power of c, but when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), each term in the second part contributes its coefficient times \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2c^{-k}\\). But if the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the c terms, then the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second part. As I thought earlier, the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 64, so 6 times 64 is 384. But wait, let me check this again. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where the exponents of a, b, and c are 2, 2, and 0 respectively. That would make more sense, because otherwise, the coefficient would be a sum over all possible c exponents, which seems odd. So, maybe I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product. Let me try that approach. So, to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), I need to consider the product of the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion and the term \\(c^0\\) from the second expansion. So, first, from \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, as I found earlier. From \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is the middle term, which is when the exponents of c and 1/c cancel each other out. So, in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We need the exponent of c to be 0, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\). So, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion is 20. Now, since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), it's the product of the coefficients from each part, so 6 times 20, which is 120. Therefore, the coefficient is 120. Wait, that makes sense. So, the initial thought about 384 was incorrect because that would be if we're summing over all c exponents, but if we're looking for a specific term where c^0, then it's 20, and multiplied by 6 gives 120. So, I think the correct answer is 120. Let me just verify that again. So, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. In \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. So, multiplying these together gives 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is 120. So, that's the answer.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by considering the product of the relevant coefficients from each binomial expansion. \n\n1. From \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n2. From \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) (the constant term) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n\nMultiplying these coefficients together gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{120}"

So, if I set \\(4 - k = 2\\), that means \\(k = 2\\). So, the term is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} a^{2}b^{2}\\). Calculating the binomial coefficient, \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\nBut wait, the problem isn't just \\((a + b)^4\\); it's multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I need to consider that as well. Hmm, so the entire expression is the product of two expansions: \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But the term we're interested in is \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\). That means, in the product, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will be multiplied by the constant term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because if we take \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part and multiply it by something from the second part, to get just \\(a^2b^2\\), that something must be a constant (i.e., \\(c^0\\)), because otherwise, we'd have extra \\(c\\) terms attached.\n\nSo, to find the coefficient, I need to find two things:\n1. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which I already found to be 6.\n2. The constant term (i.e., the term with \\(c^0\\)) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nThen, the overall coefficient will be the product of these two, right? Because when you multiply the two expansions together, each term from the first expansion is multiplied by each term from the second. So, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part is multiplied by the constant term from the second part, giving \\(a^2b^2\\) times that constant, so the coefficient is 6 times the constant term.\n\nSo, let me find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Again, I can use the binomial theorem here. The expansion is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying each term, that's \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m} = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\).\n\nWe need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, because that's the constant term. So, we set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} c^{0}\\), which is just \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\).\n\nCalculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). Wait, is that right? Let me check: 6! is 720, 3! is 6, so 720/(6*6) is 720/36, which is indeed 20. So, the constant term is 20.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the second part). So, 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't miss anything. So, in the first part, the coefficient is 6, and in the second part, the constant term is 20. So, when we multiply these two, the term becomes \\(6 \\times 20 \\times a^2b^2\\), which is \\(120a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient is 120.\n\nIs there any other term that could contribute to \\(a^2b^2\\) when multiplied by something from the second expansion? Hmm, let me think. The second expansion is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which only involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, any term from the second expansion would have some power of \\(c\\), either positive or negative. But since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), the only way that can happen is if we take the constant term (i.e., \\(c^0\\)) from the second expansion. If we take any other term, say \\(c^1\\) or \\(c^{-1}\\), then the resulting term would have \\(a^2b^2c^1\\) or \\(a^2b^2c^{-1}\\), which are different from \\(a^2b^2\\). So, only the constant term from the second expansion contributes to the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the product. So, I think I was correct in multiplying 6 and 20 to get 120.\n\nWait, let me double-check my calculations to be sure. So, binomial coefficients: for \\((a + b)^4\\), the term with \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). For \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term with \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, 6 * 20 is 120. Yep, that seems correct.\n\nI don't think I missed anything here. So, the coefficient is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is found by multiplying the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) and the constant term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\n1.

Now, the expression also includes \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I wonder if I need to consider that part as well. Wait, the problem is specifically asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, does that mean I don't need to worry about the \\(c\\) terms? Or maybe I do, because the entire expression is multiplied together. Hmm, let me think. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).

So, that would mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is actually the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part.

So, does that mean that the coefficient is just the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, and the second part doesn't affect it because it's multiplied by other terms? Or maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Wait, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, considering all possible terms. But in that case, since the second part doesn't have \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), the \\(a^2b^2\\) term would only come from the first part, and its coefficient would just be multiplied by the entire second expression. But that doesn't change the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\); it just means that the \\(a^2b^2\\) term is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would actually be the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the entire second expansion. Wait, but that would make the coefficient a sum involving terms with \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so perhaps it's just 6 times the entire second expression. But that seems odd because the problem is probably expecting a numerical coefficient. Maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again. The problem is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). We need the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, as I found earlier. Then, when you multiply by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will only come from the first part, and the second part will contribute a factor that's multiplied by it. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 times the sum of all the terms in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems too broad. Wait, no, because each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is a separate term, so when you multiply, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), etc. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which, in the entire product, would have coefficients multiplied by the coefficients from the second expansion. Wait, but that would mean the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that can't be right because the problem is expecting a specific coefficient, not a sum. Maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2 and the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0. That would make more sense because then we have a specific term. So, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). Let me check the original problem again. It says: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" Hmm, it just says \\(a^2b^2\\), so maybe it's considering the entire expression, and any term that has \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by any power of \\(c\\). But in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which would result in a polynomial in \\(c\\), and the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be that entire polynomial. But that seems unlikely because the problem is probably expecting a numerical coefficient, not a polynomial. So, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think differently. Perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), that is, the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2, and the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0. That would make sense because then we're looking for a specific term. So, let me assume that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). So, to find that, I need to consider both expansions. First, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, as I found earlier. Then, in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), I need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, because when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), it will give \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). So, let me find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). To do that, I can use the binomial theorem again. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, we need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0. That is, \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Let me calculate that. \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficients from each part, which is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). So, the coefficient is 120. Wait, but let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. The problem didn't specify the exponent of \\(c\\), just \\(a^2b^2\\). So, if I'm correct in assuming that the problem is asking for \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then 120 is the answer. But if it's not, and the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, then the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of the second part, which would be a polynomial in \\(c\\). But that seems unlikely because the problem is probably expecting a numerical answer. So, I think my assumption that it's asking for \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is correct. Therefore, the coefficient is 120. Let me double-check my calculations. For \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). For \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying them together gives 6 * 20 = 120. Yes, that seems right.

So, effectively, we're summing over all possible coefficients from the second expansion, each multiplied by the coefficient 6 from the first part. So, the total coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion.\n\nWait, but the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\). So, let me compute that. When \\(c = 1\\), \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 \u00d7 64 = 384. Hmm, that seems straightforward, but let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here.\n\nWait, another way to think about it is that when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in one polynomial is multiplied by all the coefficients of all terms in the other polynomial. So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, it's the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial, which is 6, multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 64. So, 6 \u00d7 64 = 384. That makes sense.\n\nAlternatively, I could think of it as the product of the two expansions. The first expansion has terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the second expansion has terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). Since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), the only way to get a term with \\(a^2b^2\\) is to take the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first expansion and multiply it by every possible term from the second expansion. So, each of those terms from the second expansion has a coefficient, and when multiplied by 6, they all contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. So, the total coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, giving 384.\n\nWait, but let me check this another way. Maybe I should expand both parts separately and then see how the coefficients combine. Let's start with the first part: \\((a + b)^4\\). As I found earlier, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. So, the term is \\(6a^2b^2\\).\n\nNow, the second part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let's expand this using the binomial theorem as well. The expansion is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying each term, that becomes \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\).\n\nNow, when I multiply the two expansions together, I have:\n\n\\((6a^2b^2) \\times \\left(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\right)\\).\n\nSo, this results in \\(6a^2b^2 \\times \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\).\n\nWhich can be written as \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} 6 \\dbinom{6}{m} a^2b^2 c^{6 - 2m}\\).\n\nSo, each term in this sum is \\(6 \\dbinom{6}{m} a^2b^2 c^{6 - 2m}\\), meaning that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the sum of the coefficients of each term in the second expansion. Wait, but each term in the second expansion is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\), so the coefficient for each power of \\(c\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\). Therefore, the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m}\\), which is \\(2^6 = 64\\), as I found earlier. So, the total coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 \u00d7 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me make sure that this approach is correct. So, each term in the second expansion is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\), so when multiplied by \\(6a^2b^2\\), each term becomes \\(6 \\dbinom{6}{m} a^2b^2 c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, in the entire product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is present in all these terms, each multiplied by a different power of \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), so we need to sum all the coefficients attached to \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, we sum \\(6 \\dbinom{6}{m}\\) for all \\(m\\) from 0 to 6, which is 6 times the sum of \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\) from \\(m=0\\) to 6. Since the sum of \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\) is 64, as before, the total coefficient is 6 \u00d7 64 = 384.\n\nWait, that seems consistent. Alternatively, maybe I can think of it as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6, and the second part, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, contributes a factor of 64 when considering all possible coefficients, so 6 \u00d7 64 = 384.\n\nWait, let me check if there's another approach. Perhaps I can consider that when you have two independent variables, the coefficients multiply when you take terms from each. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6, and the coefficient of any term in the second part is some \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\), but when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), each term becomes \\(6 \\dbinom{6}{m} a^2b^2 c^{6 - 2m}\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) across all terms is the sum of \\(6 \\dbinom{6}{m}\\) for \\(m=0\\) to 6, which is 6 \u00d7 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can compute the entire expansion and look for the coefficient, but that seems tedious. Alternatively, perhaps I can consider that the product of two polynomials is such that the coefficient of a term in one polynomial is multiplied by the entire other polynomial. So, in this case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial is 6, and when multiplied by the second polynomial, which is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients of the second polynomial, which is 64, so 6 \u00d7 64 = 384.\n\nWait, another way to think about it: The product of two polynomials is such that each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the sum over all terms where the product contributes to \\(a^2b^2\\). But in this case, since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are only in the first polynomial, the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) is to take the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first polynomial and multiply it by any term from the second polynomial. Therefore, the coefficient is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial (which is 6) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial (which is 64), giving 384.\n\nWait, but let me verify this by another method. Let's compute the sum of the coefficients in the second polynomial. The second polynomial is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The sum of coefficients is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), so we get \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\), as before. So, the sum of the coefficients is 64, which means that when we multiply by 6, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) becomes 6 \u00d7 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because sometimes when variables are involved, the coefficients might not just multiply directly. Let me think: The first polynomial is in variables \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the second is in \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, when you multiply them, the variables are independent, so the coefficients do multiply. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is indeed the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial and the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial. So, 6 \u00d7 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me check with specific terms. Let's say in the second polynomial, the term with \\(c^6\\) has coefficient 1, \\(c^4\\) has coefficient 6, \\(c^2\\) has coefficient 15, \\(c^0\\) (which is 1) has coefficient 20, \\(c^{-2}\\) has coefficient 15, \\(c^{-4}\\) has coefficient 6, and \\(c^{-6}\\) has coefficient 1. So, if I multiply \\(6a^2b^2\\) by each of these, I get terms like \\(6a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(36a^2b^2c^4\\), \\(90a^2b^2c^2\\), \\(120a^2b^2\\), \\(90a^2b^2c^{-2}\\), \\(36a^2b^2c^{-4}\\), and \\(6a^2b^2c^{-6}\\). So, each of these terms has a coefficient that is a multiple of 6. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the sum of all these coefficients, which is 6 + 36 + 90 + 120 + 90 + 36 + 6. Let me compute that: 6 + 36 is 42, plus 90 is 132, plus 120 is 252, plus 90 is 342, plus 36 is 378, plus 6 is 384. So, that adds up to 384, which matches the earlier result. So, that seems correct.\n\nWait, so that's a good confirmation. So, adding up all the coefficients attached to \\(a^2b^2\\) across all the terms from the second expansion, each multiplied by 6, gives a total of 384. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 384.\n\nSo, to recap, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 64. Multiplying these together gives 6 \u00d7 64 = 384. Alternatively, by expanding the second polynomial and adding up each coefficient multiplied by 6, we also get 384. So, that seems to be the correct answer.\n\nI don't think I made any mistakes here. The key was realizing that since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would involve multiplying the coefficient from the first polynomial by the sum of all coefficients from the second polynomial. This approach seems solid, and the verification by expanding the second polynomial and adding up the coefficients confirms the result.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{384}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break down the problem step by step.\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term \\(a^2b^2\\) occurs when \\(k = 2\\), giving the coefficient:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\n   \\]\n\n2. **Consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   Using the binomial theorem, this expansion is:\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n   \\]\n   The sum of all coefficients in this expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\):\n   \\[\n   (1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\n   \\]\n\n3. **Combine the results:**\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is the product of the coefficient from the first expansion and the sum of the coefficients from the second expansion:\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 64 = 384\n   \\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{384}\\)."

    "text": " So, I need to find the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2. That would correspond to \\(k = 2\\) in the binomial expansion because \\(4 - k = 2\\) implies \\(k = 2\\). So, the coefficient here would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Let me calculate that: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6. \n\nNow, the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Hmm, so I guess the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because when you multiply, the variables \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are only from the first part, and the variables \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) are from the second part. So, to get the term \\(a^2b^2\\), the second part must contribute a term where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out, meaning \\(c^0\\). \n\nWait, let me think again. Actually, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, each term in the expansion will be a product of a term from the first expansion and a term from the second expansion. So, to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I need to consider all the terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any term from the second expansion, but since the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), it's actually just the coefficient from the first part, because the second part doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. Wait, that can't be right because the entire expression is a product, so maybe I'm overcomplicating it. \n\nWait, no, actually, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4\\) times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms are separate from the \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) terms. So, when you multiply them, the variables \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are all distinct. Therefore, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would only come from the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), and the second part doesn't affect \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would just be the same as in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, regardless of what happens in the second part. \n\nWait, but that seems too straightforward. Let me check if I'm misunderstanding the problem. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, which is \\((a + b)^4\\) times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But since the second part only involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), when you multiply, the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms are independent of the \\(c\\) terms. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, and the second part would contribute a factor that doesn't affect \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). Therefore, the coefficient remains 6. \n\nWait, but that seems too simple. Maybe I'm missing something. Let me think again. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient in the entire expansion, considering all variables. But since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient would just be the coefficient from the first part, as the second part's expansion doesn't affect \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem wants the coefficient in the entire expansion, but that doesn't make sense because \\(a^2b^2\\) is only present in the first part. The second part doesn't contribute any \\(a\\) or \\(b\\) terms, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is indeed 6. \n\nWait, but let me make sure. Let me think about the expansion. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). When you multiply these two, each term in the expansion is a product of a term from the first expansion and a term from the second. So, the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) come only from the first expansion, and the terms involving \\(c\\) come only from the second. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the same as in the first expansion, which is 6. \n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because sometimes when you have products, cross terms can affect coefficients, but in this case, since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), their coefficients don't get multiplied by anything else. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be 6. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me check again. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. Then, when you multiply by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in that expansion is a power of \\(c\\), but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient remains 6. \n\nWait, but that seems correct. So, the coefficient is 6. \n\nWait, but let me think again. If I have \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, as we've calculated. Then, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) can be expanded, but since we're only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), the entire second part is just a factor that doesn't affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient remains 6. \n\nWait, but that can't be right because when you multiply two expressions, the coefficients can sometimes combine. Wait, no, because \\(a^2b^2\\) is only in the first part, and the second part doesn't have any \\(a\\) or \\(b\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would just be the same as in the first part, which is 6. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm missing something about how the terms combine. Let me try to think differently. Suppose I write the entire expression as \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). To find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I can consider that any term in the product will be of the form (term from \\((a + b)^4\\)) \u00d7 (term from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\)). Since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), the term from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) must be a constant term, i.e., \\(c^0\\). \n\nSo, to get the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I need to take the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and multiply it by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Because when you multiply the two terms, the \\(c^0\\) term doesn't affect the \\(a^2b^2\\) term, but the coefficient gets multiplied by the constant term. \n\nWait, that makes more sense. So, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Let me calculate that. \n\nUsing the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\times (1/c)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, the exponent of \\(c\\) in each term is \\(6 - 2k\\). We want the term where the exponent is 0, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Let me compute that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). \n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficients from each part, which is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). \n\nWait, that makes more sense. I think I initially forgot that the entire expression is a product, so the coefficients multiply. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the second part), giving 120. \n\nLet me double-check that. So, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. In \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Since we're looking for the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, we need to multiply these two coefficients together, because when you expand the entire expression, each term is a product of a term from each part. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is obtained by multiplying the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part with the \\(c^0\\) term from the second part. Therefore, the coefficient is indeed 6 \u00d7 20 = 120. \n\nWait, but let me think again. Is that correct? Because when you multiply two expressions, each term in the product is a combination of a term from the first and a term from the second. So, if you have a term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part, and a term \\(c^0\\) from the second part, their product is \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is just \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient is 6 \u00d7 20 = 120. \n\nAlternatively, if I had a term like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), then I would have to consider the coefficient of \\(c^k\\), but since we're only interested in \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), but wait, no, actually, in the problem, it's just \\(a^2b^2\\), so any term that includes \\(c\\) would not be \\(a^2b^2\\), it would be \\(a^2b^2c^k\\). Therefore, to get exactly \\(a^2b^2\\), we need the term where \\(k = 0\\), so the coefficient is 6 \u00d7 20 = 120. \n\nWait, but now I'm confused because initially I thought the coefficient would just be 6, but now I'm getting 120. Which one is correct? Let me think. \n\nWhen you have two separate expressions multiplied together, the coefficients of specific terms combine by multiplication if the variables are independent. So, in this case, \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term from the first expression, and \\(c^0\\) is a term from the second expression. So, when you multiply them, you get \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is just \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient is 6 \u00d7 20 = 120. \n\nBut wait, if I had just \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. If I then multiply it by something else, say, 5, the coefficient becomes 30. Similarly, here, the second part \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) has a term with coefficient 20, so when you multiply, it's 6 \u00d7 20 = 120. \n\nTherefore, the correct coefficient is 120. \n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. Let me think of it another way. Let's expand both parts and see. \n\nFirst, \\((a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6. \n\nNow, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15/c^2 + 6/c^4 + 1/c^6\\). So, the constant term is 20. \n\nWhen you multiply these two expansions, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion will be multiplied by 20 (the constant term), resulting in \\(20a^2b^2\\). There are no other terms in the second expansion that don't involve \\(c\\), so the only term contributing to \\(a^2b^2\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 \u00d7 20 = 120. \n\nWait, but let me check if that's correct. If I have two separate expressions, say, \\(A = (a + b)^4\\) and \\(B = \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), then when you multiply them, each term in \\(A\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(B\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(A\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(B\\), but only the term in \\(B\\) that is \\(c^0\\) will result in a term that is \\(a^2b^2\\) (since multiplying by any other term in \\(B\\) would introduce a \\(c\\) term). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(A\\) multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(B\\), which is 6 \u00d7 20 = 120. \n\nTherefore, I think the correct answer is 120. \n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me consider a simpler case. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, \\((a + b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2\\), and \\((c + 1/c)^1 = c + 1/c\\). Now, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be zero because there's no \\(a^2b^2\\) term in \\((a + b)^2\\). Wait, but that's a different case because the exponent is 2, so \\(a^2b^2\\) isn't present. Let me take another example where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^4 \\times (c + 1/c)^0\\). Then, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6, as before, because \\((c + 1/c)^0 = 1\\). Now, if I have \\((a + b)^4 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\), then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 \u00d7 1 (since the constant term in \\((c + 1/c)^1\\) is 0, but wait, no, \\((c + 1/c)^1 = c + 1/c\\), so the constant term is zero. Wait, that's not correct because there is no constant term. Wait, no, when you have \\((c + 1/c)^1\\), it's just \\(c + 1/c\\), so there is no \\(c^0\\) term. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be zero because there's no term in the second part that is \\(c^0\\). \n\nWait, but in our original problem, the second part is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which does have a constant term, as we calculated earlier. So, in that case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 \u00d7 20 = 120. \n\nWait, but in my earlier example, if I have \\((a + b)^4 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 \u00d7 0 = 0 because there's no constant term in the second part. That makes sense because the product would have terms like \\(a^2b^2c\\) and \\(a^2b^2/c\\), but not \\(a^2b^2\\) itself. So, in our problem, since the second part does have a constant term, the coefficient is 120. \n\nTherefore, I think I can confidently say that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is 120. \n\nWait, but let me just go through the steps again to make sure I haven't missed anything. \n\n1. Find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\).\n   - Using the binomial theorem, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n\n2. Find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\).\n   - Using the binomial theorem, the general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\).\n   - Set the exponent equal to 0: \\(6 - 2k = 0 \\Rightarrow k = 3\\).\n   - The coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n\n3. Multiply the two coefficients together because the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part must be multiplied by the constant term in the second part to give \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product.\n   - So, \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nTherefore, the coefficient is 120. \n\nI think that's solid. I can't see any mistakes in this reasoning now. So, the final answer should be 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by considering each part separately and then multiplying the coefficients.\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\), so the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n\n2. **Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n   \\]\n   The constant term (\\(c^0\\)) occurs when \\(6 - 2k = 0 \\Rightarrow k = 3\\). The coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n\n3. **Multiply the coefficients:**\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

    "text": " So, I need to find the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2. That would correspond to when \\(4 - k = 2\\), so \\(k = 2\\). So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Let me calculate that: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient is 6 for that term. Now, the expression also has \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I need to consider this part as well. But wait, since the problem is only asking about the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), maybe the terms involving \\(c\\) don't affect this coefficient? Let me think. So, the entire expression is a product of two separate binomial expansions: \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When you multiply two expressions together, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), maybe the coefficient is just the coefficient from the first part, multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part evaluated at the appropriate term? Wait, no, that doesn't sound right. Wait, actually, no. Because \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term from the first part, and when you multiply by any term from the second part, it would create a term that includes \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\) as well. But the original problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). Wait, that can't be right because in the product, each term from the first expansion is multiplied by each term from the second. So, actually, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by every term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part, but that doesn't make sense because the second part is a separate variable. Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first part, and when multiplied by the second part, which is in terms of \\(c\\), it becomes \\(a^2b^2\\) times something involving \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\). Wait, no, because in the product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would actually be the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients from the second part. Wait, but that doesn't seem right either. Let me think more carefully. When you have two separate expressions multiplied together, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each factor. But in this case, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is only in the first factor, \\((a + b)^4\\), and the second factor, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), has terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by any term from the second factor, you get terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2c^{-k}\\), but none of these would be just \\(a^2b^2\\), because they would all have a \\(c\\) term attached. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would actually be zero, because there's no term in the second factor that is a constant (i.e., \\(c^0\\)) that would multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) to give just \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, but that can't be right because the second factor does have a term when the exponents cancel out. Let me check that. The second factor is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem, this expands to \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(1/c\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). Now, for the exponent of \\(c\\) to be zero, we need \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which implies \\(m = 3\\). So, the term where \\(m=3\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} c^{0} = \\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, the constant term in the second factor is 20. So, when we multiply the first factor by the second factor, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first factor will be multiplied by the constant term 20 from the second factor. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the coefficient from the first factor, which is 6, multiplied by the constant term from the second factor, which is 20. So, 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120. Wait, let me double-check that. So, the first part's coefficient is 6, and the second part's constant term is 20, so 6 * 20 = 120. That seems correct. Alternatively, if I consider the entire expansion, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is present in the first part, and when multiplied by the constant term of the second part, which is 20, it becomes 120a^2b^2. There are no other terms in the second factor that would contribute to \\(a^2b^2\\) because any other term would have a positive or negative exponent of \\(c\\), which would make the term have \\(c\\) in it, thus not just \\(a^2b^2\\). So, yes, the coefficient is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Multiplying these gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\boxed{120}."

So, the coefficient is 6. \n\nNow, the original expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the second part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I suppose that when we multiply these two expanded expressions together, each term in the first expansion will multiply each term in the second expansion. But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), maybe I don't need to expand the entire second part. Instead, perhaps I just need to find the coefficient of the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because when I multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), the only way that term remains as \\(a^2b^2\\) is if it's multiplied by 1 in the second part. So, if the second part has a term with \\(c^0\\), that would be the constant term, and multiplying by that would leave the \\(a^2b^2\\) term unchanged. \n\nWait, is that correct? Let me think. If I have \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by something from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), then unless that something is 1, the term will have some power of \\(c\\) attached. But the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). Hmm, wait, no. Wait, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but in the entire expression, which includes both \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) and \\(c\\). So, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Maybe it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by any power of \\(c\\), but in that case, the coefficient would actually be the product of the coefficients from each part. \n\nWait, no, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me go back. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, when you expand this, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\), and then it's multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But wait, that doesn't seem right because that would make the coefficient a polynomial in \\(c\\), but the problem is just asking for a numerical coefficient. Hmm, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question. Maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). But that seems odd because the entire expression includes \\(c\\) terms. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when considering the entire expression as a polynomial in \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\), but I'm not sure. Wait, maybe I should look again.\n\nWait, the problem says: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, perhaps the question is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by any power of \\(c\\), but in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which doesn't make sense because the problem expects a numerical coefficient. Alternatively, maybe the question is only considering the terms where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out, so that the term is a constant with respect to \\(c\\), meaning the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. So, perhaps the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\) in the entire expression.\n\nWait, that makes more sense. So, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), meaning the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by 1 (the constant term) from the second part. So, the coefficient would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\).\n\nOkay, so first, let me find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). To do that, I can use the binomial theorem again. So, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(1/c\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\).\n\nWe want the exponent of \\(c\\) to be zero, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the term where \\(k = 3\\) is the constant term. The coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20.\n\nNow, going back to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficients from each part. So, that's 6 (from \\((a + b)^4\\)) times 20 (from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\)). So, 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient is 120.\n\nWait, let me just make sure I didn't make any mistakes. So, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) which is 6. Then, in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the constant term is when the exponent is zero, which occurs at \\(k = 3\\), and the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\) which is 20. Multiplying 6 and 20 gives 120. So, yes, that seems correct.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the binomial coefficients. For \\((a + b)^4\\), the expansion is \\(a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\), so yes, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. For \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the expansion would be \\(c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15(1/c^2) + 6(1/c^4) + 1/c^6\\). So, the constant term is indeed 20. So, multiplying 6 and 20 gives 120. So, I think that's correct.\n\nWait, but another way to think about it is that when you multiply the two expansions together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then the coefficient would actually be 6 times the entire second expansion, which would make it a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, so maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by \\(c^0\\), which is what I originally thought, and that would be 120.\n\nWait, but perhaps I should think differently. Maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, so the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\). But that seems unlikely because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, not a polynomial. So, maybe the problem is indeed asking for the coefficient when the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out, making it a constant term.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), without considering \\(c\\), which would mean that the coefficient would be 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but that would result in a coefficient that's a function of \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense in this context. Therefore, I think the correct interpretation is that we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by the constant term in the second expansion, which is 20, so 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but let me check once more. The problem is: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\).\" So, when you multiply these two expressions, each term in the first expansion will multiply each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second part. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would actually be \\(6 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But that doesn't make sense because the problem is expecting a numerical coefficient. Therefore, perhaps I was wrong in my initial approach.\n\nWait, maybe I should consider that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would mean that the coefficient is a polynomial, which isn't a single number. Therefore, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), which is the constant term. So, that would be 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is miswritten, and it's only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, but that seems too straightforward. But given the presence of \\(c\\) in the expression, I think the problem is indeed asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times some power of \\(c\\), but perhaps it's expecting just the coefficient from the first part, but that seems unlikely.\n\nWait, perhaps I should think of the entire expression as a product of two polynomials, and the term \\(a^2b^2\\) can be multiplied by any power of \\(c\\), so the coefficient would actually be the product of the coefficients from each part. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^k\\) in the second part is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) in the product would be 6 * \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would include all possible powers of \\(c\\). But that's not a single number, so perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when multiplied by \\(c^0\\), which would be 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, considering all possible powers of \\(c\\), but that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical value. Therefore, I think the correct approach is that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), so the constant term, which is 120.\n\nWait, just to make sure, let me think about how the product works. So, \\((a + b)^4\\) has terms from \\(a^4\\) down to \\(b^4\\), each with their coefficients, and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) has terms from \\(c^6\\) down to \\(1/c^6\\). When you multiply these two, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first will be multiplied by each term in the second, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), etc., each with their own coefficients. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product isn't a single number because it's multiplied by different powers of \\(c\\). Therefore, the only way the problem can make sense is if it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), which is the constant term. So, that would be 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), ignoring the \\(c\\) part, but that seems unlikely because the expression includes both parts. So, I think the correct interpretation is that we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nWait, but let me check my calculation of the binomial coefficients again. For \\((a + b)^4\\), the expansion is \\(a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\), so yes, \\(a^2b^2\\) has coefficient 6. For \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the expansion is \\(c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15(1/c^2) + 6(1/c^4) + 1/c^6\\). So, the constant term is indeed 20. Therefore, 6 * 20 = 120. So, I think that's correct.\n\nWait, but another way to approach this is to consider that the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, when you multiply these together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20, so the combined coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120. So, that's consistent with what I found earlier.\n\nWait, but perhaps I should think of it as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the product of the coefficients from each part. So, since the first part contributes 6 and the second part contributes 20, the total coefficient is 120. So, that seems to be the answer.\n\nWait, but let me just make sure I didn't make a mistake in the binomial coefficients. For \\((a + b)^4\\), \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) is indeed 6. For \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term where \\(c^0\\) is when \\(k = 3\\), so \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, 6 * 20 = 120. So, I think that's correct.\n\nWait, another way to check is to consider specific values. Let me assign specific values to \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) and see if the coefficient comes out as 120. Let me set \\(a = 1\\), \\(b = 1\\), and \\(c = 1\\). Then, \\((1 + 1)^4 = 16\\), and \\(\\left(1 + 1/1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the product is 16 * 64 = 1024. Now, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be \\(1^2 * 1^2 = 1\\), and the coefficient is 120, so 120 * 1 = 120. But when I plug in \\(a = 1\\), \\(b = 1\\), \\(c = 1\\), the total value is 1024. But the sum of all coefficients in the expansion would be when \\(a = 1\\), \\(b = 1\\), \\(c = 1\\), which is 16 * 64 = 1024. So, if the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is 120, then that's just one part of the total. So, that doesn't conflict with anything. So, perhaps that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, let me think about another way. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the entire second factor is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, when you multiply 6 by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), you get 6 times that polynomial, which would mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the entire polynomial. But that can't be, because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, so I think the correct interpretation is that we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nWait, perhaps I can think of it as the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part and the term \\(c^0\\) from the second part. So, the coefficient would be 6 * 20 = 120. So, that seems to be the correct answer.\n\nI think I've considered this from multiple angles, and each time I arrive at the same conclusion: the coefficient is 120.

    "text": " So, I need to find the term where the exponents of a and b are both 2. Let me see, in the expansion, each term is \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\\). So, to get \\(a^2b^2\\), I need \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). So, when k=2, the term is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} a^{2}b^{2}\\). The binomial coefficient \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) is 6, right? Because 4 choose 2 is 6. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. \n\nBut wait, the original expression isn't just \\((a + b)^4\\), it's multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I need to consider that as well. Hmm, so the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Since the two parts are multiplied together, the terms will multiply each other. But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). That means I don't need to worry about the c terms when looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Because when you multiply two expressions, the terms from each expression multiply, but since we're only interested in \\(a^2b^2\\), any terms involving c will just tag along, but since we're looking for the coefficient specifically for \\(a^2b^2\\), those c terms don't affect it. Wait, is that correct? Let me think again. So, if I have \\((a + b)^4\\) times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), and I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), then actually, the coefficient will be the same as the coefficient in \\((a + b)^4\\) because the other part doesn't affect the a and b terms. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just 6, regardless of the other part. Hmm, that seems too straightforward. Let me double-check.\n\nWait, no, maybe I'm missing something. Because the problem is about the product of two expressions, so perhaps I need to consider if there's any interaction between the two parts that affects the coefficient. But actually, when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first polynomial gets multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. So, for the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, it will be multiplied by every term in the second part, which is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve c, that means we need to consider the term in the second part that is a constant term, i.e., the term where the exponent of c is zero. Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by that constant term, you'll still have \\(a^2b^2\\), whereas multiplying by other terms would introduce c terms, which would change the term. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Oh, so I was wrong earlier; I do need to consider the constant term in the second part. \n\nAlright, so let's tackle that. I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Again, I can use the binomial theorem here. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying each term, that becomes \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m}\\), which is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, each term has an exponent of 6 - 2m. We need the term where the exponent is zero, because that's the constant term. So, set 6 - 2m = 0. Solving for m: 6 = 2m => m = 3. So, the constant term is when m=3. Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} c^{0}\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, 6 choose 3 is 20. So, the constant term is 20. \n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficient from the first part and the constant term from the second part. So, that's 6 (from \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\)) multiplied by 20 (the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)). So, 6 * 20 is 120. Therefore, the coefficient is 120.\n\nWait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake. So, in the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, that's correct because \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). In the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the constant term is when the exponent is zero, which is when m=3, so \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, 6 * 20 is indeed 120. So, yeah, I think that's correct.\n\nBut just to double-check, let me think about the entire expansion. So, when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by every term in the second part. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), we have to consider how many times \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by a term that doesn't change the a and b parts. That is, only the constant term in the second part. So, that's correct, because if you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by, say, \\(c^k\\), you'd get \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), which isn't \\(a^2b^2\\), so only the constant term contributes to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient is indeed 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, another way to think about it: when you have two independent variables, a, b, and c, the coefficient of a specific term involving only a and b would be the product of the coefficient in the a and b part and the coefficient in the c part that is a constant. So, yeah, that makes sense. So, I think 120 is the correct coefficient.\n\nI don't think I made any mistakes here. The key was realizing that the c terms only affect the overall expression if they multiply with other terms involving c, but since we're focusing solely on \\(a^2b^2\\), the only contribution comes from the constant term in the second part. So, multiplying the two coefficients together gives the final answer.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is found by multiplying the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) and the constant term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\n1. For \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n2. For \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the constant term is when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, which occurs at \\(m=3\\), giving \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n3. Multiply these coefficients: \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\boxed{120}"

Hmm, so I guess the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of the second part. But wait, the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so maybe I don't need to consider the terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) because those would add exponents of \\(c\\), but the question is only about \\(a\\) and \\(b\\).

So, when you multiply these two expansions together, each term from the first expansion is multiplied by each term from the second expansion. But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), maybe I'm supposed to consider that \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term on its own, and it's multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't make sense because \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term without \\(c\\), so when multiplied by terms involving \\(c\\), it would just carry along, but the coefficient would be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. Wait, but the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so maybe it's just the coefficient from the first part, and the second part doesn't affect it because it's being multiplied by terms that have \\(c\\) in them. Wait, that doesn't seem right.\n\nWait, no, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question. Maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where the exponents of \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are 2, 2, and 0, respectively. That would make more sense because then we're looking for a specific term that combines both expansions. So, in that case, I need to find the term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) that has \\(c^0\\), because when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), it would give a term with \\(a^2b^2c^0\\).\n\nOkay, so let me break this down. First, find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which we already found to be 6. Then, find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Once I have both coefficients, I can multiply them together to get the overall coefficient for \\(a^2b^2c^0\\).\n\nSo, let's tackle the second part: \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I can expand this using the binomial theorem as well. The expansion would be \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying each term, that becomes \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m} = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\).\n\nNow, we're looking for the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so we set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the term where \\(m=3\\) will have \\(c^0\\). The coefficient for this term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Let me calculate that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). So, the coefficient from the second part is 20.\n\nNow, since the entire expression is the product of \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But since we're only interested in the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, we only need the term with coefficient 20 from the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire expression is the product of the two coefficients we found: 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the second part).\n\nCalculating that: 6 \u00d7 20 = 120. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is 120.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake. So, the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6. The second part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Multiplying them together gives 120. That seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of it as the entire expression being a product of two independent expansions, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) would be the product of the coefficients from each respective term in each expansion. So, that's exactly what I did. So, I think 120 is the correct answer.\n\nWait, just to double-check, maybe I can consider the entire expansion. But that would be too time-consuming. Alternatively, maybe I can consider that the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6a\u00b2b\u00b2, and in the second part, the term with \\(c^0\\) is 20. So, when you multiply 6a\u00b2b\u00b2 by 20, you get 120a\u00b2b\u00b2. So, yes, the coefficient is 120.\n\nI think that makes sense. So, the final answer should be 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break down the problem into two parts using the binomial theorem.\n\nFirst, we consider the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\).

Using the binomial theorem, we know that:\n\\[\n\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n\\]\nWe need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0.

So, does that mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just 6 times whatever the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)? Because when you multiply, to get a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), you need the exponents of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) to cancel out.

Wait, but actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all the terms in the second part.

But since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are only in the first polynomial, and \\(c\\) is only in the second, the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are determined entirely by the first polynomial, and the exponents of \\(c\\) are determined by the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by every term in the second polynomial. But wait, the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, does that mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire second polynomial? Because when you multiply, each term from the first part is multiplied by each term from the second part. But since the second part is a separate variable, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the same as in the first part, but multiplied by the entire second polynomial. Wait, that doesn't sound right. Let me try a different approach. Maybe I should consider that the second polynomial \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) can be expanded, and each term in that expansion is a constant (with respect to \\(a\\) and \\(b\\)), so when you multiply by \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficients of \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all the coefficients from the second polynomial. Because each term in the second polynomial is a coefficient times \\(c^k\\), so when you multiply, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in the second polynomial. Wait, but the sum of all the coefficients in the second polynomial is found by plugging in \\(c = 1\\). So, \\(\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 times 64, which is 384. But wait, let me check that again. Because if I have \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), then when I expand it, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient from the first part (which is 6) multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. But since the second part is a polynomial in \\(c\\), each term in the second part is a constant (with respect to \\(a\\) and \\(b\\)), so when you multiply, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in the second part. And the sum of the coefficients in the second part is indeed \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). So, 6 times 64 is 384. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 384. Wait, but let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. Another way to think about it is that when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficients multiply. So, if I have \\(P(a, b) \\times Q(c)\\), then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(P(a, b)\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(Q(c)\\). Because each term in \\(Q(c)\\) is a constant, so when you multiply, each term in \\(P(a, b)\\) is scaled by each term in \\(Q(c)\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is indeed 6 times 64, which is 384. Alternatively, I can think of it as the product being the sum over all possible combinations of terms from each polynomial. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first polynomial, and it gets multiplied by every term in the second polynomial. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, each multiplication by a term in the second polynomial just scales the coefficient by that term's coefficient. Therefore, the total coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. That makes sense. So, I think the coefficient is 384. Let me just verify that I didn't make any mistakes in the binomial coefficients. For \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\), which is 6, correct. And for \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the sum of the coefficients is indeed \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, 6 * 64 = 384. Yeah, I think that's the right answer.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break the problem into two parts:\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\):\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\n   \\]\n   So, the coefficient from the first part is 6.\n\n2. **Consider the second part \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   The sum of all coefficients in this expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\):\n   \\[\n   \\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\n   \\]\n\n3. **Combine the results:**\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficients from each part:\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 64 = 384\n   \\]\n\n**Final Answer:** The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{384}\\)."

    "text": " Okay, so I need the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) appears in this expansion. That should be when \\(4 - k = 2\\), so \\(k = 2\\). So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Let me calculate that. \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\\). So, the coefficient from the first part is 6. Now, the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, the term we're looking for is \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\). So, does that mean that the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just 6 times whatever the coefficient is for \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\)? Because if I multiply by 1 (i.e., \\(c^0\\)), then the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would remain as is. So, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Let me think about how to do that. Again, using the binomial theorem, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying that, it becomes \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m} = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the exponent of \\(c\\) in each term is \\(6 - 2m\\). We want the term where the exponent is 0 because that's the constant term. So, set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Let me compute that. \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient from the second part is 20. Now, putting it all together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficients from each part, since the terms are multiplied together. So, that would be 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the second part). Let me calculate that: 6 * 20 = 120. Wait, but I should double-check to make sure I didn't make a mistake. So, in the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). In the second part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the constant term is when \\(m = 3\\), giving \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, multiplying these together gives 120. Hmm, that seems right. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120. I don't think I missed anything here. Let me just recap to make sure. The problem is asking for \\(a^2b^2\\), which comes from the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\), and the constant term from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\).

Okay, so the coefficient from the first part is 6.\n\nNow, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient I'm looking for is 6 multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because when I multiply the two parts together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and not any term involving \\(c\\), I think I only care about the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. Because if I have \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by \\(c^k\\), unless \\(k=0\\), the term won't be just \\(a^2b^2\\).

Wait, is that right? Let me check: 6! is 720, 3! is 6, so 720/(6*6) is 720/36, which is indeed 20. So, the coefficient is 20.\n\nSo, now, going back to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficients from each part. That is, 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the second part). So, 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient should be 120.\n\nWait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake. So, first, I found that in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. Then, in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. So, when you multiply these two parts, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by the constant term (with respect to \\(c\\)) which is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 * 20 = 120. Hmm, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of the entire expression as a product of two independent binomial expansions. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the first part, and the term \\(c^0\\) comes from the second part, so their product is the term \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is just \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient is indeed 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but just to be thorough, let me consider if there's any other way that \\(a^2b^2\\) could come up when multiplied by other terms from the second expansion. But no, because \\(a^2b^2\\) is only from the first part, and to get \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, we need to multiply it by \\(c^0\\) from the second part, since any other term would involve a power of \\(c\\), which would make the term \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) where \\(k \\neq 0\\), and thus not just \\(a^2b^2\\).\n\nSo, I think my reasoning is correct.

Now, I'm a bit confused because the second part involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), but the term we're looking for is \\(a^2b^2\\). That term doesn't involve \\(c\\), so I guess I just need to consider the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and then multiply it by the entire expansion of the second part, but only considering the constant term because \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't have any \\(c\\) terms. Wait, no, actually, that might not be the case. Let me think again.\n\nWait, actually, when you multiply two expressions, each term in the first expression is multiplied by each term in the second expression. So, if I have \\((a + b)^4\\) times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), then each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).

Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by the constant term, you get \\(a^2b^2\\) times that constant, so the coefficient would be 6 times the constant term's coefficient.\n\nWait, let me make sure. So, if I take the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part, which has a coefficient of 6, and then multiply it by the constant term from the second part, that should give me the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, with the coefficient being 6 times the constant term's coefficient from the second expansion. So, I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nLet me work on that. The expression is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Again, I can use the binomial theorem here. So, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m} = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). I need to find the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, because that's the constant term. So, set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). So, the constant term is when \\(m = 3\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Let me compute that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, 6! is 720, but 3! is 6, so 6!/(3!3!) = 720/(6\u00d76) = 720/36 = 20. So, yes, the constant term is 20.\n\nWait, but let me check that again because sometimes it's easy to make a mistake with factorials. So, 6 choose 3 is indeed 20 because 6\u00d75\u00d74 / (3\u00d72\u00d71) = 120 / 6 = 20. So, correct.\n\nSo, the constant term in the second expansion is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 (from the first part) times 20 (from the second part), which is 6 \u00d7 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't miss anything. So, when you multiply the two expansions, each term from the first expansion is multiplied by each term from the second expansion. But since we're only interested in the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2 each, and the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, the only contributing term is when we take \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion and the constant term from the second expansion. So, the coefficient is 6 \u00d7 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Is there any possibility that other terms could contribute to \\(a^2b^2\\)? For example, if there's a term in the second expansion with \\(c^k\\) and another term with \\(c^{-k}\\), but since \\(a^2b^2\\) is independent of \\(c\\), any \\(c\\) terms would have to cancel out, which only happens in the constant term. So, yes, only the constant term in the second expansion would contribute to the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the product.\n\nSo, to recap:\n\n1. Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is 6.\n\n2. Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem to find the constant term, which is 20.\n\n3. Multiply these two coefficients together: 6 \u00d7 20 = 120.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is 120.\n\nWait, but let me just check if I made any calculation errors. So, \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) is 6, that's correct. \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\) is 20, that's correct. So, 6 \u00d7 20 is indeed 120. So, I think that's the correct answer.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can approach this problem differently to verify. Let me consider the entire product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When expanding this, each term will be of the form \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}a^{4 - k}b^k \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) occurs when \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\), which gives us the coefficient from the first part as \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Then, to get a term without \\(c\\), we need \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which gives \\(m = 3\\), so the coefficient from the second part is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, the overall coefficient is 6 \u00d7 20 = 120. Yep, that checks out.\n\nI think I've covered all the steps and made sure that each part is correct. So, I'm confident that the coefficient is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplying it by the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20. Thus, the overall coefficient is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\(\\boxed{120}\\)"

Wait, no, actually, when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, you get terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) and \\(a^2b^2c^{-k}\\), but since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), that means we need to consider all terms in the second expansion that, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), result in a term with \\(a^2b^2\\). But wait, no, because \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term in the first part, and when multiplied by any term in the second part, it becomes \\(a^2b^2\\) times something, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would actually be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. Because each term in the second expansion is a coefficient times a power of \\(c\\), and when you multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), you're effectively scaling the coefficient by each of those terms. So, the total coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nWait, but the sum of the coefficients in a polynomial is found by setting all variables to 1. So, for \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), setting \\(c = 1\\) gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of the coefficients is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 times 64, which is 384. Hmm, that seems high. Let me check if that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Perhaps the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is only present in the first part, and when multiplied by the second part, it's just scaled by the entire expansion. But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then yes, it would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion. So, 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me make sure. Let's think of it as the product of two polynomials: one in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the other in \\(c\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial. Because each term in the second polynomial is a coefficient times some power of \\(c\\), and when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), it becomes \\(a^2b^2\\) times that coefficient times \\(c^k\\) or \\(c^{-k}\\). So, when we collect all the terms that have \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), the coefficient would be the sum of all those coefficients from the second polynomial multiplied by 6. So, yes, 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which would be the product of the coefficients from each part, but since the second part is a separate variable, the coefficient would just be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second part, which is 64, so 6*64=384.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should expand both parts and see. Let me try that.\n\nFirst, expand \\((a + b)^4\\). As I did before, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. Now, expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem, this would be \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, each term in this expansion is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\).\n\nNow, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part (which is 6) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Because each term in the second expansion is a coefficient times a power of \\(c\\), and when you multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), you get terms like \\(6 \\times \\dbinom{6}{k} a^2b^2 c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) across all possible powers of \\(c\\) is the sum of all \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}\\) for \\(k\\) from 0 to 6.\n\nWait, but the sum of \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}\\) from \\(k=0\\) to 6 is \\(2^6 = 64\\), as I thought earlier. So, 6 * 64 = 384. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 384.\n\nWait, but let me check again to make sure I'm not making a mistake. Alternatively, maybe I should consider that the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), when expanded, has terms with different powers of \\(c\\), but when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), it's just scaling the coefficient by each of those terms. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is indeed 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, so 6*64=384.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Perhaps the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, so it's just the product of the coefficients from each part. But that would mean 6 times the sum of coefficients in the second part, which is 64, so 384.\n\nWait, but another way to think about it is that the entire expression is a product of two independent polynomials. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial. Because each term in the second polynomial is a coefficient that scales the \\(a^2b^2\\) term.\n\nYes, I think that's correct. So, the coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me check with an example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^1 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, \\((a + b)(c + 1/c) = a c + a/c + b c + b/c\\). The coefficient of \\(a^1b^0\\) would be (1) * (1 + 1) = 2, because the sum of coefficients in the second part is 2. Similarly, the coefficient of \\(a^0b^1\\) would also be 2. So, in that case, the coefficient of \\(a^1b^0\\) is 1 * (1 + 1) = 2, which is correct.\n\nSimilarly, in the problem at hand, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me think again. If I have \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. Then, when I multiply by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which has 7 terms, each with coefficients \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}\\), the total sum of coefficients is 64. So, when I multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, each term contributes \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}\\) to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^{6 - 2k}\\). But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), it's actually the sum of all those coefficients, which is 64. So, the total coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but actually, no. Because each term in the second expansion is a separate term, so when you multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), you get terms like \\(6 \\dbinom{6}{k} a^2b^2c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the sum over all \\(k\\) of \\(6 \\dbinom{6}{k}\\), which is 6 times the sum of \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}\\) from \\(k=0\\) to 6, which is 6 * 64 = 384. So, yes, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of it as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the entire expansion of the second part. So, since the second part is a polynomial in \\(c\\), when you multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), you're effectively scaling the coefficient by each term in the second polynomial. So, the total coefficient is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 64, so 384.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. Let me take a simpler example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^1 \\times (c + 1/c)^2\\). Then, expanding, it's \\((a + b)(c^2 + 2 + 1/c^2)\\). The coefficient of \\(a\\) in the first part is 1. The sum of coefficients in the second part is \\(1 + 2 + 1 = 4\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a\\) in the product would be 1 * 4 = 4. Let's check: \\((a + b)(c^2 + 2 + 1/c^2) = a c^2 + 2a + a/c^2 + b c^2 + 2b + b/c^2\\). The coefficient of \\(a\\) is 2, but according to my previous logic, it would be 1 * 4 = 4, which is incorrect. So, that suggests that my approach is wrong.\n\nWait, so in this example, the coefficient of \\(a\\) is 2, not 4. So, my earlier reasoning was flawed. Hmm, that's a problem. So, I need to rethink this.\n\nSo, in the example, \\((a + b)(c + 1/c)^2 = (a + b)(c^2 + 2 + 1/c^2)\\). The coefficient of \\(a\\) is 2, not 4. So, where did I go wrong? I thought it would be the coefficient of \\(a\\) in the first part times the sum of coefficients in the second part, but that's not the case. So, maybe my initial approach is incorrect.\n\nWait, so in the example, the coefficient of \\(a\\) is 1 in the first part, and when multiplied by the second part, which is \\(c^2 + 2 + 1/c^2\\), the term \\(a\\) is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, resulting in \\(a c^2 + 2a + a / c^2\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a\\) in the product is the sum of the coefficients from the second expansion, which is 1 (from \\(c^2\\)) + 2 + 1 (from \\(1/c^2\\)) = 4. But wait, in reality, when I expand, I get \\(a c^2 + 2a + a / c^2\\), so the coefficient of \\(a\\) is indeed 4. But when I look at the expanded form, I see that the coefficient of \\(a\\) is 2, but that's because I'm considering only the constant term. Wait, no, in the expanded form, the coefficient of \\(a\\) is 2, but that's because I'm considering the entire product. Wait, no, let's compute it properly.\n\nWait, no, actually, in the expansion, the coefficient of \\(a\\) is 2 because the term \\(2a\\) comes from the middle term in the second expansion. But when I think about it, the coefficient of \\(a\\) in the product is actually the sum of the coefficients from the second expansion, because each term in the second expansion is multiplied by \\(a\\). So, in the example, the coefficient of \\(a\\) is 1 (from \\(c^2\\)) + 2 (from the constant term) + 1 (from \\(1/c^2\\)) = 4. But when I actually expanded it, I saw \\(a c^2 + 2a + a / c^2\\), which suggests that the coefficient of \\(a\\) is 2, but that's not correct because each term is separate. Wait, no, in reality, the coefficient of \\(a\\) is the sum of the coefficients from the second expansion. So, in the product, the coefficient of \\(a\\) is 1 (from \\(c^2\\)) + 2 (from the constant term) + 1 (from \\(1/c^2\\)) = 4, but when I actually look at the product, it's \\(a c^2 + 2a + a / c^2\\), which indeed has coefficients 1, 2, and 1 for \\(a c^2\\), \\(a\\), and \\(a / c^2\\), respectively. So, the coefficient of \\(a\\) in the product is the sum of these, which is 1 + 2 + 1 = 4. But wait, that's not correct because in the product, each term is separate. So, the coefficient of \\(a\\) in the product is not a single number, but rather, the coefficient of \\(a c^2\\) is 1, the coefficient of \\(a\\) is 2, and the coefficient of \\(a / c^2\\) is 1. So, if the problem had asked for the coefficient of \\(a\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), it would be 4, but if it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a\\) times \\(c^0\\), it's 2.\n\nWait, so in the original problem, the question is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), does that mean we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2 c^0\\)? Or are we just looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\)? The problem statement says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", without specifying any power of \\(c\\), so perhaps it's the sum of all coefficients where the term is \\(a^2b^2 c^k\\) for any \\(k\\). In that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, so 384.\n\nBut in the example I did earlier, if I had \\((a + b)(c + 1/c)^2\\), and I asked for the coefficient of \\(a\\), without specifying any power of \\(c\\), it would be 4, because that's the sum of coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by 1. So, in that case, the coefficient of \\(a\\) is 4, which is correct because the product includes terms like \\(a c^2\\), \\(2a\\), and \\(a / c^2\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a\\) regardless of \\(c\\) is indeed 4.\n\nSimilarly, in the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\) would be 6 times 64, which is 384.\n\nWait, but let me confirm with another example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^2\\). Expanding, it's \\((a^2 + 2ab + b^2)(c^2 + 2 + 1/c^2)\\). The coefficient of \\(ab\\) in the first part is 2. The sum of coefficients in the second part is 4. So, the coefficient of \\(ab\\) in the product would be 2 * 4 = 8. Let's check: Expanding, the terms involving \\(ab\\) would be \\(2ab c^2 + 4ab + 2ab / c^2\\). So, the coefficient of \\(ab c^2\\) is 2, \\(ab\\) is 4, and \\(ab / c^2\\) is 2. So, the total coefficient of \\(ab\\) regardless of \\(c\\) is 2 + 4 + 2 = 8, which matches 2 * 4 = 8. So, that seems correct.\n\nTherefore, going back to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is indeed 6 times the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought of the example where \\((a + b)(c + 1/c)^2\\) gave a coefficient of \\(a\\) as 4, which is the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion times the coefficient from the first part. So, yes, that seems consistent.\n\nTherefore, I think the correct answer is 384.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let me compute the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). The sum of coefficients is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), so \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, that's correct.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me think again. If I have \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. Then, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) has a sum of coefficients equal to 64. So, when I multiply these two, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nSo, after all that, I think the coefficient is 384.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{384}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break down the problem into two parts using the binomial theorem.\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\), so the coefficient is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\n   \\]\n\n2. **Consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n   \\]\n   The sum of the coefficients in this expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\):\n   \\[\n   (1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\n   \\]\n\n3. **Combine the results:**\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is the product of the coefficient from the first part and the sum of the coefficients from the second part:\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 64 = 384\n   \\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{384}\\)."

    "text": " So, I need to find the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2. Let me think. The general term in the expansion is \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\\). So, if I set \\(4 - k = 2\\) for \\(a\\), that would mean \\(k = 2\\) as well. So, the term where \\(k=2\\) will be the one with \\(a^2b^2\\). Let me compute that coefficient. \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) is calculated as \\(\\dfrac{4!}{2!2!}\\), which is \\(\\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6. But wait, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I think I need to consider the expansion of both parts and then multiply them together. But wait, actually, since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), maybe the other part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), doesn't affect the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). That is, when we multiply the two expanded expressions, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part will be multiplied by each term from the second part, but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), the terms from the second part won't affect the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). So, maybe the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just the same as the coefficient in the first part, multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. Wait, but that doesn't make sense because the second part could have multiple terms, so when we multiply, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But since the question is just about \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\), I think the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) will be the coefficient from the first part times the entire expansion of the second part. But that seems a bit confusing. Let me think again. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are independent of those involving \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the sum of all the coefficients in the second part. But wait, no, that's not quite right because when you multiply two expressions, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the sum of all the coefficients in the second part. But wait, the second part is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which when expanded has terms like \\(c^6\\), \\(6c^4\\), \\(15c^2\\), \\(20\\), \\(15/c^2\\), \\(6/c^4\\), \\(1/c^6\\). So, each term in the first expansion, \\((a + b)^4\\), is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first part, which is \\(6a^2b^2\\), will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, resulting in terms like \\(6a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(36a^2b^2c^4\\), etc. But since the question is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\), that would mean that the coefficient is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the sum of all the coefficients in the second part. Wait, no, that can't be right because the coefficients in the second part are multiplied by each term, so the overall coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion. But wait, the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 * 64 = 384. But wait, that seems too high. Let me check. Alternatively, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Wait, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the powers of \\(c\\), so it's the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for any \\(k\\). But no, the problem just says \\(a^2b^2\\), so I think it's considering all possible powers of \\(c\\), so the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. But let me think again. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, which would include all possible terms, so it's the coefficient from the first part times the entire expansion of the second part. But that would mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. But let me verify that. Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it, and the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which would be the product of the coefficients from each part. But wait, no, because the two parts are multiplied together, so each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first part is 6a^2b^2, and when multiplied by the entire second expansion, each term will have some power of \\(c\\), but the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) across all terms would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion. Wait, but that would be 6 * (sum of coefficients in second expansion). The sum of coefficients in the second expansion is when \\(c = 1\\), so \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, 6 * 64 = 384. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 384. But wait, let me think again. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of the other variables, so it's just 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second part, which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, maybe I'm making a mistake here. Let me approach it differently. Let me consider that the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, when you multiply these two, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion is \\(6a^2b^2\\), and it's multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion because each term in the second expansion is being multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion is indeed \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\), so 6 * 64 = 384. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 384. Wait, but let me check again. Alternatively, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without considering the \\(c\\) terms, so it's the same as in the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the entire second expansion, so the coefficient would be 6 * (sum of coefficients in second expansion) = 6 * 64 = 384. Yeah, that seems correct. So, I think the answer is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is found by first determining the coefficient in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplying it by the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is \\(2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n\\boxed{384}"

But wait, the problem is the coefficient in the entire expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Hmm, so I need to consider both parts of the product. But wait, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), right? So, does that mean that when I multiply the two expressions together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by every possible term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)? But the question is just about the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. Wait, no, actually, that's not quite right. Because when you multiply two expressions, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), perhaps we can consider that the coefficient will be the product of the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) and the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but only considering the constant term? Wait, no, that might not be the case. Let me think again. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\) as we found, with coefficient 6. Now, when we multiply this by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is another binomial expansion, each term in the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second. But since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), when multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), it would be equivalent to multiplying 6 by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, no, that's not quite accurate. Because \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term in the first part, and when you multiply the entire expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by every term in the second expansion. However, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. That is, in the entire product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will have a coefficient that is the sum of the products of the coefficients from each part that result in \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, but in the first part, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, and in the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the expansion will have terms involving various powers of \\(c\\), but since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), does that mean that when we multiply, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is just 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)? Wait, that doesn't make sense because each term in the second expansion is multiplied by 6, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^k\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, actually, in the product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by every term in the second expansion, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, is that correct? Let me think again. When you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a term in the product is the sum of the products of coefficients of terms whose variables multiply to give that term. In this case, since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), any term from the second expansion multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\) will result in a term involving \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2/c^k\\), etc. But the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would only consider the terms where the power of \\(c\\) is zero, right? Because \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term with no \\(c\\) at all. So, actually, I think I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), and then multiply that by 6. Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by the term with \\(c^0\\), you get \\(a^2b^2\\), and that's the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, now I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me use the binomial theorem again for this part. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be zero, so we set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(6 = 2k\\) => \\(k = 3\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6*6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 * 20 = 120. Wait, but let me double-check that. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 20, so when you multiply these two parts together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will have a coefficient of 6 * 20 = 120. That seems right. Alternatively, another way to think about it is that the entire expression is the product of two expansions, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion and the constant term in the second expansion, which is 6 * 20 = 120. So, I think that's the answer.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplying it by the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20. Therefore, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\boxed{120}"

But wait, the expression isn't just \\((a + b)^4\\); it's multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I need to consider that as well. But since the term \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), maybe the coefficient from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) doesn't affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)? Hmm, that seems a bit confusing. Let me think again. Wait, actually, the entire expression is the product of \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when I multiply these two, each term from the first expansion is multiplied by each term from the second expansion. But since I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), that means I need to find all terms in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) that result in a constant term (i.e., where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero). Because if I multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by a term with \\(c^k\\), it won't contribute to \\(a^2b^2\\); only the constant term will. So, first, I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Then, I can multiply that by the coefficient 6 from the first part. Let me verify that. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) (the constant term) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). That makes sense because when you multiply the two expansions, the terms combine, and only the constant term in the second expansion will contribute to the \\(a^2b^2\\) term without introducing any \\(c\\) terms. So, let's find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Again, using the binomial theorem, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Let me calculate that. \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). Wait, hold on, that calculation seems a bit off. Let me compute it again. \\(6! = 720\\), and \\(3! = 6\\), so \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{720}{(6)(6)} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). Yes, that's correct. So, the constant term is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficients from both parts. That would be 6 (from \\((a + b)^4\\)) multiplied by 20 (from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)). So, 6 times 20 is 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120. Let me just double-check to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. First, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\\). Then, in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying these gives 6 * 20 = 120. Yeah, that seems correct.

So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6. Now, the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I wonder if this part affects the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, since \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) are separate variables from \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), I think that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would just be the product of the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) and the sum of all terms from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).

So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, no, that's not exactly right because \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), so when you multiply, the terms involving \\(a^2b^2\\) would be \\(a^2b^2\\) times each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), does that mean we just take the coefficient from the first part and multiply by the entire expansion of the second part? Or is it more complicated? Wait, no, because when you multiply the two expressions, each term from the first expansion is multiplied by each term from the second. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, that would mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, that might not be correct because each term in the second expansion has a different power of \\(c\\), so when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), they would each contribute to different terms. But the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When expanding this, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, which would result in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), etc., each with their own coefficients. But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). Wait, no, that doesn't make sense because each multiplication would result in a different term involving \\(c\\). So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the same as the coefficient in the first part, because when you multiply by the second part, you're effectively scaling it by the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. Wait, but no, because each term in the second expansion has a different power of \\(c\\), so when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, you get different terms, each with a coefficient that's the product of 6 and the coefficient from the second expansion. But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), I think that's not possible because \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by different powers of \\(c\\), making each term unique. Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the question. It says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", which might imply that it's considering terms where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2 each, regardless of the exponents of \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because each term in the second expansion would contribute to a term with \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by some power of \\(c\\). But wait, actually, when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, you're just scaling it by each coefficient, so the total coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) across all powers of \\(c\\) would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion. But wait, the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), so \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of the coefficients is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 times 64, which is 384. But wait, that seems too straightforward. Let me check that again. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some specific \\(k\\), but it's not. It's just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\). So, perhaps the answer is indeed 6 times 64, which is 384. But let me think again. Alternatively, maybe I'm supposed to consider that the second expansion doesn't affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) because it's multiplied by terms that involve \\(c\\), so the coefficient remains 6. But that doesn't make sense because each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, as I thought earlier. So, 6 * 64 = 384. Wait, but let me confirm this by expanding both parts. Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Let me consider that the entire expression is the product of two polynomials, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Since the second part is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the sum of its coefficients is when \\(c = 1\\), which is \\(2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 * 64 = 384. So, I think that's the answer. But wait, let me make sure. Alternatively, maybe I should consider that each term in the second expansion has a specific coefficient, and when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), each term contributes to a different term in the product, but the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would be the sum of all those products. So, yes, that would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, giving 384. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), that is, the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. In that case, I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product. That would be different. Let me think about that. So, in that case, I need to find the term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. That term is the constant term. So, let's find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(1/c\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). The exponent of \\(c\\) is zero when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) would be 6 * 20 = 120. But wait, the problem didn't specify the exponent of \\(c\\), just \\(a^2b^2\\). So, I'm confused now. Is it asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), or specifically when \\(c^0\\)? The problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", so I think it's regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, giving 384. But earlier, I thought that if it's asking for \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), it would be 120. But the problem didn't specify \\(c^0\\), so I think it's 384. Wait, but let me check the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\)\". So, it's just \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in the product, each term will be of the form \\(a^2b^2 \\times c^k\\) for some \\(k\\), each with a coefficient. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would include all such terms. But that's not standard because usually, when you ask for the coefficient of a term, you're referring to a specific term, including all variables. So, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), that is, the term where \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 * 20 = 120. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by any power of \\(c\\), so the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, giving 384. But I'm not sure which interpretation is correct. Let me think again. The problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", so in the product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) can be multiplied by any power of \\(c\\), so each such term would have a coefficient, and the problem is asking for the sum of all these coefficients. So, for example, the term \\(a^2b^2c^6\\) has a coefficient of 6 * 1 = 6, the term \\(a^2b^2c^4\\) has a coefficient of 6 * 6 = 36, and so on, down to \\(a^2b^2c^{-6}\\) with coefficient 6 * 1 = 6. So, the total coefficient of all terms with \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion. Since the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion is when \\(c = 1\\), which is \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\), so 6 * 64 = 384. Therefore, the coefficient is 384. But I'm a bit unsure because sometimes when people ask for the coefficient of a term, they mean the coefficient when all variables are considered, but in this case, it's only \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). Alternatively, maybe I should treat \\(c\\) as another variable and find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), which would indeed be 384. So, I think that's the answer. But to be thorough, let me check both interpretations. If it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it's 6 * 20 = 120. If it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), it's 6 * 64 = 384. Since the problem didn't specify the power of \\(c\\), I think the intended answer is 384. So, I'll go with that.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break down the problem as follows:\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term \\(a^2b^2\\) occurs when \\(k = 2\\):\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} a^{2}b^{2} = 6a^2b^2\n   \\]\n   So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in this part is 6.\n\n2. **Consider the second part \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   Since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), we need to consider how this part affects the coefficient.

That means the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, no, that doesn't make sense because when you multiply two polynomials, each term from the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second. But since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient would actually be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that might not be correct because the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me try to see it another way. The expression is a product of two polynomials: one in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and another in \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, when you multiply them together, the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from the terms involving \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that can't be right because when you multiply, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems off because the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not considering the \\(c\\) terms. Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Let me clarify: the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be multiplied by every possible term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't seem right because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Maybe the question is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, but since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient would just be the same as in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't make sense because the coefficient would then be 6 times the sum of coefficients in the second part, which is not what is being asked. Wait, perhaps I'm misinterpreting the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, in the entire product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term from the second expression. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the entire expansion of the second part. But that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second part. But wait, the sum of all coefficients in the second part is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), so let's compute that. The second part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). If we set \\(c = 1\\), then it becomes \\((1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of all coefficients in the second part is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 * 64 = 384. Wait, but that seems too high. Let me think again. Alternatively, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, meaning that the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of the second part, but that doesn't make sense because the coefficient is a single number. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting the coefficient to be 6, because the second part doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. But that can't be right because when you multiply, the coefficients do get multiplied. Wait, maybe I'm confusing something. Let me approach it differently. The expression is \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is multiplied by every term in the second part. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second part. As I calculated earlier, the sum of coefficients in the second part is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. But wait, let me check that again. Alternatively, maybe the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the powers of \\(c\\), so it's 6 times the entire expansion of the second part, but that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. So, perhaps I'm wrong, and the problem is actually only considering the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms and ignoring the \\(c\\) terms, which doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it, and the coefficient is just 6 because the second part doesn't affect the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. But that can't be right because when you multiply two expressions, each term is multiplied by each term, so the coefficient should be 6 times the entire expansion of the second part. Wait, but that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, not a number. So, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, so the coefficient would be 6 times the expansion of the second part. But that would make the coefficient a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't seem right because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. Hmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me try to think differently. Perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some \\(k\\), but it's only given as \\(a^2b^2\\). Alternatively, maybe the problem is written incorrectly, but I don't think so. Alternatively, perhaps the second part is being considered separately, but that doesn't make sense because the problem is about the product. Wait, maybe the second part is a separate factor, and since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient is just 6. But that seems too simple. Let me check with an example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^1 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, the expansion would be \\((a + b)(c + 1/c)\\). The coefficient of \\(a^1b^0\\) would be \\(1 \\times (c + 1/c)\\), which is \\(c + 1/c\\). But if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^1b^0\\), it's not a number but a polynomial. So, perhaps in the original problem, the coefficient is a polynomial, but the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, which suggests that maybe I'm misunderstanding the question. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only considering the part of the expression that doesn't involve \\(c\\), but that doesn't make sense because the entire expression includes both parts. Wait, perhaps the problem is actually written as \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), and we're to consider the product as a polynomial in \\(a, b, c\\), and find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), treating \\(c\\) as another variable. In that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which would be a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, which suggests that perhaps the problem is only considering the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) parts, and the \\(c\\) part is being treated as a constant. But that doesn't make sense because \\(c\\) is a variable. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, meaning that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which is 6 * 64 = 384. But let me confirm that. The sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\(2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 * 64 = 384. So, the final answer is 384. But wait, let me make sure. Let me think about how the multiplication works. Each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by every term in the second part. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Since the sum of coefficients in the second part is 64, then yes, 6 * 64 = 384. Therefore, the coefficient is 384. Alternatively, maybe the problem is expecting me to consider that the second part doesn't affect the \\(a^2b^2\\) term, so the coefficient remains 6, but that doesn't seem right because when you multiply polynomials, the coefficients do get multiplied. So, I think the correct approach is to multiply the coefficient from the first part by the sum of coefficients from the second part, giving 6 * 64 = 384. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 384. Wait, but let me check this with a smaller example to make sure I'm not making a mistake. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^1 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, the expansion is \\((a + b)(c + 1/c) = a c + a/c + b c + b/c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^1b^0\\) is \\(c + 1/c\\). Similarly, the coefficient of \\(a^0b^1\\) is also \\(c + 1/c\\). Now, if I wanted the coefficient of \\(a^1b^0\\), it's \\(c + 1/c\\), which is a polynomial, not a number. So, in this case, the coefficient is not a number but a polynomial in \\(c\\). Therefore, in the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be a polynomial in \\(c\\), which is 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient, which is usually a number, so perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Alternatively, maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some \\(k\\), but it's only given as \\(a^2b^2\\), so perhaps the problem is expecting me to consider the entire expansion and find the coefficient regardless of \\(c\\). But that doesn't make sense because the coefficient would then be a sum over all possible \\(c\\) terms, which would be the sum of coefficients in the second part, which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 384. I think that's the correct approach. So, to recap: The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 * 64 = 384. So, the final answer is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is found by first determining the coefficient in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplying it by the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 64. Thus, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\(\\boxed{384}\\)."

    "text": " So, I need to find the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2. That would correspond to \\(k = 2\\) in the binomial expansion, right? Because when \\(k = 2\\), the exponent of \\(a\\) is \\(4 - 2 = 2\\) and the exponent of \\(b\\) is \\(2\\). So, the coefficient for that term is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Let me calculate that. \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. But wait, the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, does this affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)? Hmm, I think it does because when you multiply two expressions together, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression. But since the second expression involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), and the term we're interested in is \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), maybe the coefficient remains the same? Wait, no, that doesn't seem right. Let me think again. If I have \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), then each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), we need to find the term in the second expansion that is a constant, i.e., the term where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out. Because if we have a term like \\(c^k\\) multiplied by \\(1/c^k\\), that would give 1, which is a constant. Alternatively, if the second expression has a term that is 1, then when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), it would just give \\(a^2b^2\\) with the same coefficient. So, let me figure out what the constant term is in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). To find the constant term, I can use the binomial theorem again. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying that, each term becomes \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\cdot c^{-m} = \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the exponent of \\(c\\) in each term is \\(6 - 2m\\). We want the term where the exponent is 0 because that's the constant term. So, we set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Let me compute that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20. Now, going back to the original problem, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part has a coefficient of 6, and the constant term in the second part is 20. Since these two terms are multiplied together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake here. So, the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the coefficient from the constant term in the second expansion is 20, so when multiplied together, it's 120. That seems right. Alternatively, maybe I can think of the entire expression as the product of two expansions and consider how the terms combine. But since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are different variables, the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is by taking \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part and the constant term from the second part. So, yeah, that makes sense. So, the coefficient should be 6 times 20, which is 120. I think that's the answer.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break down the problem as follows:\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term with \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\), so the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n\n2. **Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n   \\]\n   The constant term (where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0) occurs when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which gives \\(m = 3\\). The coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n\n3. **Multiply the coefficients:**\n   Since the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion is multiplied by the constant term from the second expansion, the overall coefficient is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

I'm supposed to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but the second part involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). Wait, does that affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms? Hmm, I think not directly because \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\). So, maybe the coefficients from the second part will just multiply the coefficients from the first part.

Wait, no, actually, when you multiply two terms, each term from the first expansion is multiplied by each term from the second.

Wait, 6! is 720, and 3! is 6, so 6!/(3!3!) is 720/(6*6) = 720/36 = 20. Yes, that's correct. So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficients from both parts, which is 6 * 20 = 120. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 20, so when you multiply these two, you get 6*20=120. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will appear with coefficient 120 in the entire expression. Hmm, that seems right. Let me check another way. Alternatively, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). When you expand this, each term is of the form \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}a^{4 - k}b^k \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\(k=2\\) in the first part, and \\(m=3\\) in the second part, because that gives \\(c^0\\). So, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} \\times \\dbinom{6}{3}\\), which is 6 * 20 = 120. Yep, that's consistent. So, I think the answer is 120. But just to make sure, let me think if there's any other way this could be approached. Alternatively, maybe I can consider the entire expansion, but I think the approach I took is correct. So, I think the coefficient is 120. Wait, but let me compute \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\) again to confirm. 6 choose 3 is (6*5*4)/(3*2*1) = 120/6 = 20. Yes, that's correct. So, 6 * 20 is indeed 120. So, I think I'm confident that the coefficient is 120.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break the problem into two parts:\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term with \\(a^2b^2\\) occurs when \\(k = 2\\), so the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n\n2. **Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n   \\]\n   The term with \\(c^0\\) (the constant term) occurs when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which gives \\(m = 3\\).

    "text": " So, I think I need to find the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2. That would be when \\(4 - k = 2\\) for \\(a\\), so \\(k = 2\\). Therefore, the coefficient from the \\((a + b)^4\\) part is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Let me calculate that: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient from the first part is 6. Now, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but the term we're interested in is \\(a^2b^2\\), and the second part involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, does that mean that the second part doesn't affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)? Hmm, maybe not. Because when you multiply two expressions together, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression. But since we're only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and the second part doesn't have any \\(a\\) or \\(b\\) terms, it's just a constant multiplier for the entire \\((a + b)^4\\) part. Wait, is that right? Let me think again. So, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is a separate expansion, but when I multiply it by \\((a + b)^4\\), each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which comes from the \\((a + b)^4\\) part, the second part must just contribute a constant factor. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. Wait, but that doesn't make sense because the second part is raised to the 6th power and involves \\(c\\), so maybe it's just a constant value when considering terms in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try to approach it differently.\n\nWait, maybe I should consider that the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), is independent of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), so when I multiply it by \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems a bit unclear. Alternatively, perhaps the second part doesn't affect the coefficients of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) at all, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be the same as in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, multiplied by whatever the sum of all terms in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is. Wait, no, that's not right because when you multiply two expressions, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second, but since we're looking for a term that only has \\(a^2b^2\\), the rest of the terms from the second expression would just multiply it by constants. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the sum of all terms in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't make sense because \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is a polynomial in \\(c\\), and when you multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), you'd get terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for different exponents \\(k\\). So, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), meaning that we just need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and then multiply it by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial, not a constant. Hmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Wait, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, considering all possible powers of \\(c\\). But that seems odd because \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\). Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times any power of \\(c\\), but that doesn't quite make sense. Let me read the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, perhaps it's just asking for the coefficient of the term that has \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without considering \\(c\\), which would mean that we can treat \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) as a constant when considering the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. But that seems unlikely because \\(c\\) is a separate variable. Wait, maybe I should think of it as the product of two polynomials, one in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and one in \\(c\\). So, when you multiply them, the coefficients for the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms would just be multiplied by the entire expansion of the \\(c\\) terms. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so that would be the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would make the coefficient a polynomial in \\(c\\), which is probably not what the problem is asking for. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering only the terms where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out, so that the term is a constant. But that's not specified in the problem. Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try a different approach. Let me first find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which we've already determined is 6. Now, the entire expression is this multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is a coefficient times some power of \\(c\\), and when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), it becomes \\(a^2b^2\\) times that coefficient times \\(c^k\\) for some \\(k\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would include all those terms where the power of \\(c\\) is anything. But that seems a bit strange because the coefficient would then be a polynomial in \\(c\\). Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), meaning the constant term in \\(c\\). That would make more sense. So, maybe I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire expression. So, that would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). That sounds plausible. Let me check that. So, if I consider the entire product, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part would be multiplied by each term in the second part, which are terms like \\(c^k\\) or \\(c^{-k}\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). That makes sense. So, first, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me compute that. Using the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We want the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire expression is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the second part), which is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120. Wait, but I should make sure that I'm interpreting the problem correctly. The problem says, \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\" without specifying anything about \\(c\\). So, if I'm considering all possible powers of \\(c\\), then the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial. But that seems unlikely because the problem probably expects a numerical coefficient. Therefore, it's more reasonable to assume that the problem wants the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), i.e., the constant term with respect to \\(c\\). Therefore, the answer is 120. Let me just recap to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 20. Multiplying these together gives 120, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120. Yeah, that seems right.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break it down into two parts:\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\):\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} a^{2}b^{2} = 6a^2b^2\n   \\]\n   So, the coefficient from this part is 6.\n\n2. **Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) and find the constant term (coefficient of \\(c^0\\)):**\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n   \\]\n   We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0:\n   \\[\n   6 - 2m = 0 \\implies m = 3\n   \\]\n   The coefficient is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\n   \\]\n\n3. **Multiply the coefficients from both parts:**\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 20 = 120\n   \\]\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

Since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), the coefficients involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are independent of the coefficients involving \\(c\\).

Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by any term from the second expansion, the coefficient would be the product of the coefficients, but since the second expansion is in terms of \\(c\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) can be multiplied by any term in the second expansion, each contributing their own coefficient. So, the total coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 (from the first part) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nWait, is that correct? Let me think again. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the product of the coefficient from the first expansion and the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion because each term in the second expansion is being multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), so each of those would contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when considering all possible terms. But actually, I'm not sure. Let me clarify.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, the sum of all coefficients in a binomial expansion can be found by setting the variable to 1. So, if I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but I'm not sure if that's correct. Let me think again. Because when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each polynomial. But in this case, since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are different variables from \\(c\\), the terms in the first polynomial don't interfere with the terms in the second polynomial.

Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, perhaps the question is treating \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) as separate variables, and we're looking for the coefficient of the term where \\(a\\) is squared, \\(b\\) is squared, and \\(c\\) is raised to some power, but the problem doesn't specify any particular power for \\(c\\). So, perhaps the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that seems odd because the coefficient should be a single number.\n\nWait, no, that can't be right. Maybe I need to consider that the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion because each term in the second expansion is being multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the total coefficient would be 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me check that. Let's consider a simpler case. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1)^1\\). The coefficient of \\(a^2b^0\\) in the first part is \\(\\dbinom{2}{0} = 1\\), and the sum of coefficients in the second part is \\((1 + 1)^1 = 2\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^0\\) in the entire expression would be 1 * 2 = 2. But let's expand it: \\((a + b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2\\), and \\((c + 1) = c + 1\\). Multiplying them: \\(a^2c + a^2 + 2abc + 2ab + b^2c + b^2\\). Now, the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) (which is \\(a^2b^0\\)) is \\(c + 1\\), which is a polynomial, not a number. So, in this case, the coefficient isn't a number but a polynomial in \\(c\\). So, perhaps in the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be a polynomial in \\(c\\), not a single number. But the problem is asking for the coefficient, so maybe I need to consider that.\n\nWait, but the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so perhaps it's considering the entire expression as a polynomial in \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\), and we're looking for the coefficient of the term \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for any \\(k\\). But the problem doesn't specify \\(c\\), so maybe it's just the sum over all \\(k\\) of the coefficients for each \\(a^2b^2c^k\\). But that would be the same as multiplying the coefficient from the first part by the sum of all coefficients in the second part. So, that would be 6 * 64 = 384, as I thought earlier.\n\nBut wait, in my earlier simple example, that approach gave me a polynomial, but perhaps that's because I didn't specify a particular power of \\(c\\). So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then it's indeed 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is only asking for the coefficient when considering the variables \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and not \\(c\\), so perhaps it's treating \\(c\\) as a constant. But that doesn't make much sense because \\(c\\) is a variable.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try to think differently. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, each term in the expansion will be of the form \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}a^{4 - k}b^k \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - m}\\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\dbinom{4}{k}\\dbinom{6}{m}a^{4 - k}b^k c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). So, that part is fixed. Now, the exponent of \\(c\\) is \\(6 - 2m\\), where \\(m\\) ranges from 0 to 6. But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the exponent of \\(c\\), we need to sum over all possible \\(m\\) the coefficients from the second part. So, the coefficient would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) times the sum over \\(m\\) of \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\). Because for each \\(m\\), the term \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\) is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), contributing \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\) to the coefficient.\n\nWait, but the sum over \\(m\\) from 0 to 6 of \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\) is equal to \\(2^6 = 64\\). So, the total coefficient would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} \\times 64 = 6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\nWait, but in my earlier simple example, when I set \\(c = 1\\), I get the sum of coefficients as 64, which matches this approach. So, perhaps that's the correct way to think about it.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem had specified a particular power of \\(c\\), say \\(c^0\\), then we would have to find the coefficient where \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which would be \\(m = 3\\), and then the coefficient would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} \\times \\dbinom{6}{3} = 6 \\times 20 = 120\\). But since the problem doesn't specify any power of \\(c\\), it's just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), so we sum over all possible \\(m\\), giving 384.\n\nWait, but let me check that. Let me consider the expansion. So, \\((a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\), and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15\\dfrac{1}{c^2} + 6\\dfrac{1}{c^4} + \\dfrac{1}{c^6}\\).\n\nNow, when I multiply these two, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second part, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product will be \\(6 \\times (1 + 6 + 15 + 20 + 15 + 6 + 1)\\). Wait, that's \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\), which matches what I got earlier.\n\nWait, but let me calculate that sum: \\(1 + 6 = 7\\), \\(7 + 15 = 22\\), \\(22 + 20 = 42\\), \\(42 + 15 = 57\\), \\(57 + 6 = 63\\), \\(63 + 1 = 64\\). Yes, that's correct. So, the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion is 64, so the total coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nBut wait, let me think again. Is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product equal to 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion? That seems to be the case because each term in the second expansion is being multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), so each of those coefficients contributes to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. So, yes, that makes sense.\n\nAlternatively, if I were to look for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), that would be different, but since the problem doesn't specify \\(c\\), it's just \\(a^2b^2\\), so we sum over all possible \\(c\\) terms. Therefore, the coefficient is 384.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because in my earlier simple example, when I multiplied \\((a + b)^2\\) by \\((c + 1)\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) was \\(c + 1\\), which is a polynomial, not a number. So, in that case, the coefficient is a polynomial, but in this problem, since we're considering the coefficient across all powers of \\(c\\), it's a number. So, perhaps in this problem, the answer is 384.\n\nWait, but let me think again. If I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\), so the entire expression becomes \\((a + b)^4 \\times 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 * 64 = 384. That seems to confirm it.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is 384.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me think about another approach. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first part, and it's multiplied by the entire second part. So, the coefficient is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, times the entire expansion of the second part. But since we're only interested in the coefficient, regardless of \\(c\\), we can treat the second part as a constant when considering the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, giving 384.\n\nYes, I think that's correct. So, the coefficient is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplying it by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 64. Thus, the total coefficient is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n\\boxed{384}"

    "text": " So, I need to find the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2. That should correspond to \\(k = 2\\) in the binomial expansion because \\(b^k\\) would be \\(b^2\\), and \\(a^{4 - k}\\) would be \\(a^{2}\\). So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Let me calculate that: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient is 6. But wait, the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I need to consider how this multiplication affects the term \\(a^2b^2\\). Since the two parts of the expression are multiplied together, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will be multiplied by every term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not any other terms involving \\(c\\). Hmm, so actually, I think the \\(c\\) terms don't affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) because when you multiply, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term is just multiplied by 1 from the other expression. Wait, that doesn't seem right. Let me think again. No, actually, when you multiply two expressions, each term in the first expression is multiplied by each term in the second expression. So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I have to consider that \\(a^2b^2\\) is being multiplied by every term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not any specific term involving \\(c\\). Wait, but maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me read the problem again: it says, \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, perhaps the question is only concerned with the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). But that seems a bit odd because in the product, \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, each of which has some power of \\(c\\). So, unless the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^k\\) for some \\(k\\), but it's not specified. Wait, maybe I misread the problem. Let me check again: it's just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), without any mention of \\(c\\). Hmm, that's a bit confusing because in the product, \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term in the second expression, each of which is a power of \\(c\\). So, unless the problem is assuming that we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), which would be the constant term. Alternatively, maybe the problem is just considering the coefficient in the expanded form, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, but that doesn't make much sense because \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\). Wait, perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). That is, it's considering all the terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) appears, each multiplied by some power of \\(c\\), and the coefficient would be the sum of all those coefficients. But that seems complicated because you'd have to multiply each term in the first expansion by each term in the second expansion. Alternatively, maybe the problem is considering only the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\), i.e., the constant term. Let me think. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is simply to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable, but since \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) are present, the product will have terms with different powers of \\(c\\), but the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the sum of all coefficients from each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). But that would mean the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which seems unlikely because the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) would be the same as evaluating it at \\(c = 1\\), which is \\(2^6 = 64\\). So, 6 times 64 would be 384. But that seems too big, and I'm not sure if that's what the problem is asking for. Alternatively, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and not considering the second part at all. But that can't be right because the problem includes the entire expression. Wait, perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, meaning that it's 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would make the coefficient a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make much sense. Alternatively, maybe the problem is a typo and is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) or something like that. But since the problem as stated is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I need to clarify. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable and is only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\). But in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which would be a complicated expression, not a single number. So, that doesn't seem right either. Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try to approach it differently. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). To find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I can consider that in the product, each term from the first expansion is multiplied by each term from the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, which is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part (which is 6) multiplied by the entire second expansion. But that would mean the coefficient is 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for a coefficient, which is a number, not a polynomial. Therefore, I must have misunderstood the problem. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, regardless of the powers of \\(c\\), but that would mean adding up all the coefficients from each term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present, each multiplied by some power of \\(c\\). But that would require knowing the specific power of \\(c\\) we're interested in, which isn't specified. Therefore, I think the problem must be asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), i.e., the constant term in \\(c\\). So, the coefficient would be 6 times the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Let me check that. So, first, find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6. Then, find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). The constant term occurs when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. Using the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\times (1/c)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be zero, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\) in the entire expression is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Therefore, the coefficient is 120. Wait, but let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. So, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and I'm interpreting it as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). Is that a valid interpretation? Well, if the problem is just asking for \\(a^2b^2\\), without any \\(c\\) terms, then yes, it's the constant term in \\(c\\). Alternatively, if the problem is considering all terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) appears, regardless of \\(c\\), then the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which isn't a single number. But since the problem is asking for a coefficient, which is a number, I think the intended interpretation is that we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). Therefore, the coefficient is 120. Let me double-check my steps. First, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Then, in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the constant term is when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, which occurs at \\(k = 3\\), so \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying these together gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Yes, that seems correct. So, the coefficient is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplying it by the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20. Therefore, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\boxed{120}"

Wait, that might not be correct. Let me think again. \n\nNo, actually, in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the expansion is of the form \\(a^{k}b^{4 - k} \\times c^{m} \\times (1/c)^{6 - m}\\), which simplifies to \\(a^{k}b^{4 - k}c^{m - (6 - m)} = a^{k}b^{4 - k}c^{2m - 6}\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would correspond to \\(k = 2\\), so \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^{2m - 6}\\) for each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But wait, no, that's not quite right. Because each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is actually the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\).

So, does that mean the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 (from \\((a + b)^4\\)) multiplied by 64 (sum of coefficients from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\)), which would be 6 * 64 = 384? Hmm, but wait, let me make sure. Because actually, when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in one polynomial is multiplied by all terms in the other polynomial, so if you're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), it's the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which includes all the terms.

Alternatively, maybe I should think of it as the product of the two expressions. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be the product of \\(a^2b^2\\) from \\((a + b)^4\\) and each term from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\).

So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 * (sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\)), which is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because sometimes when you have multiple variables, you have to consider cross terms, but in this case, \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), so the coefficients don't interfere. So, yes, I think 384 is the correct coefficient. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of it as the product of the two polynomials, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the product of the coefficients from each part, but since the second part is a polynomial in \\(c\\), the coefficient is actually multiplied by the entire expansion, so it's 6 times the sum of coefficients in the second part, which is 64. So, 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nWait, but let me check if that makes sense. If I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = (1 + 1)^6 = 64\\), which is the sum of all coefficients. So, when I set \\(c = 1\\), the entire expression becomes \\((a + b)^4 * 64\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in that would be 6 * 64 = 384. So, that seems consistent. \n\nWait, but is there another way to approach this? Maybe by expanding both parts separately and then multiplying. But that seems more complicated. Alternatively, I can think that since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are independent variables, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nWait, but let me make sure that I'm not missing anything. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), so when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\).

Let me just recap to make sure I didn't miss anything. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nWait, but let me check if the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is indeed 64. When \\(c = 1\\), \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\), so yes, that's correct. So, the sum of coefficients is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nI think that makes sense.

So, if I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) becomes \\((1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of the coefficients in the second part is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 multiplied by 64, which is 6 * 64. Let me calculate that: 6 * 60 = 360, and 6 * 4 = 24, so 360 + 24 = 384. Wait, is that correct? Let me double-check. So, the coefficient in the first part is 6, the sum of coefficients in the second part is 64, so 6 * 64 is indeed 384. Hmm, but wait a second. Let me think again. When I expand \\((a + b)^4\\), I get terms like \\(a^4\\), \\(4a^3b\\), \\(6a^2b^2\\), \\(4ab^3\\), and \\(b^4\\). Then, when I multiply this by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion gets multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, which includes terms like \\(c^6\\), \\(6c^5(1/c)\\), \\(15c^4(1/c)^2\\), and so on, down to \\((1/c)^6\\). Each of these has a coefficient, and when I multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be the sum of the coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by 6. So, that does make sense because each term in the second expansion is being multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), so the total coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients of the second expansion. Since the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion is 64, as I found earlier, then 6 * 64 is 384. So, I think that is the correct coefficient. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is 384. I don't think I made any mistakes here, but let me go through it again just to be sure. First, expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Then, the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), when expanded, has terms from \\(c^6\\) down to \\(c^{-6}\\), each with their own coefficients. The sum of all these coefficients is found by substituting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, when we multiply the two expansions together, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second. Since we're interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which only comes from the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first expansion, we need to multiply its coefficient (6) by the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion (64). So, 6 * 64 = 384. Yep, that seems right. I don't think I missed anything here. So, the answer should be 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is found using the binomial theorem, which gives us \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). The sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by substituting \\(c = 1\\), resulting in \\(2^6 = 64\\). Multiplying these together gives \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n\\boxed{384}"

So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. \n\nNow, the expression we're dealing with is the product of \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I realize that this term comes only from the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\), and the other part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\) at all. So, does that mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just the same as the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6? Wait, but I should make sure that I'm not missing anything here. Let me think again. \n\nWait, no, actually, the entire expression is a product of two expansions. So, when I multiply them together, each term in the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But since the second expansion only involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), and the first expansion involves \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), the variables are different. So, the terms in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) don't interact with the terms in \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). That means that when looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I just need to consider the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, and then multiply it by the entire expansion of the second part because every term in the second expansion will multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. But wait, actually, no. Since the second expansion doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), when I multiply the two expansions together, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\). Wait, that can't be right because \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) are separate variables. So, perhaps the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is just the coefficient from the first part, because when you multiply by the second expansion, you're introducing terms with \\(c\\), but the \\(a^2b^2\\) term would have coefficients multiplied by all the possible terms from the second expansion. Wait, no, that doesn't make sense because \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term that doesn't have \\(c\\), so when you multiply it by the second expansion, it would only be present if the second expansion has a term that's a constant (i.e., \\(c^0\\)), because otherwise, you'd have \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or something like that. So, maybe I need to find the constant term in the second expansion, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), and then multiply it by the coefficient from the first part. That makes more sense. \n\nSo, let me break this down. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the constant term in the second part. So, first, I found that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. Now, I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nTo find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), I can again use the binomial theorem. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying that, each term becomes \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m} = \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). The constant term is when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, so we set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(6 = 2m\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). So, the constant term in the second expansion is 20. \n\nNow, going back to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficient from the first part and the constant term from the second part. So, that would be \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 120. \n\nWait, let me double-check that. So, in the first expansion, \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, correct. In the second expansion, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the constant term is indeed 20 because when \\(m = 3\\), we get the term with \\(c^0\\), which is 20. So, when we multiply these two expansions together, each term from the first expansion is multiplied by each term from the second. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), the only way that happens is if we multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by the constant term from the second expansion. So, that would be 6 times 20, which is 120. \n\nI think that makes sense. Alternatively, if I think about the entire expression as the product of two polynomials, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial and the constant term in the second polynomial, since any other term in the second polynomial would introduce a power of \\(c\\) and thus make the term not just \\(a^2b^2\\). So, yes, 6 times 20 is 120. \n\nSo, I'm pretty confident that the coefficient is 120. \n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break the problem into two parts using the binomial theorem.\n\nFirst, we consider the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\). Using the binomial theorem, we have:\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n\\]\nThe term \\(a^2b^2\\) occurs when \\(k = 2\\). The coefficient is:\n\\[\n\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\n\\]\n\nNext, we consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem, we have:\n\\[\n\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n\\]\nThe constant term (where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero) occurs when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which gives \\(m = 3\\). The coefficient is:\n\\[\n\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\n\\]\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficient from the first part and the constant term from the second part:\n\\[\n6 \\times 20 = 120\n\\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by the constant term, it remains as \\(a^2b^2\\) times that constant, so the coefficient would be 6 times that constant.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm thinking correctly. So, if I have \\((a + b)^4\\) which gives me terms like \\(a^4\\), \\(4a^3b\\), \\(6a^2b^2\\), \\(4ab^3\\), and \\(b^4\\). Then, when I multiply this by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each of these terms will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of the second binomial. So, for each term in the first expansion, I'll have a product with each term in the second expansion. But since the problem is only asking about the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I don't need to consider the other terms. So, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But for the resulting product to have \\(a^2b^2\\), the other factor must be a constant term because otherwise, the product would have additional variables, right? So, only the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\) will give a term with \\(a^2b^2\\). All other terms in the second expansion have \\(c\\) raised to some power, which would make the product have \\(c\\) terms, which are not part of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 times the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nSo, now I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Again, I can use the binomial theorem here. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k\\). Simplifying each term, that becomes \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} c^{-k} = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\).\n\nNow, the constant term is the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. So, we set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Let me compute that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\).\n\nSo, the constant term in the second expansion is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the second part). So, 6 times 20 is 120.\n\nWait, but let me double-check that I'm not missing anything. So, the first expansion gives me a term with \\(a^2b^2\\) having a coefficient of 6, and the second expansion has a constant term of 20. So, when I multiply these together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by 20, giving a coefficient of 6 * 20 = 120.

So, only the constant term from the second expansion affects the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. Therefore, the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nI think that's it.

So, let me calculate the binomial coefficient for \\(k = 2\\). The binomial coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). I think that's 6 because 4 choose 2 is 6. So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), is 6. \n\nNow, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I guess the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the whole expression would just be the coefficient from the first part, because the second part is multiplied by it. Wait, no, that doesn't sound right. Let me think again. The expression is a product of two separate binomial expansions. So, when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first polynomial gets multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), maybe the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), doesn't affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)? Or does it?\n\nWait, no, actually, the entire expression is the product of the two binomial expansions. So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), that would come from taking the term with \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and multiplying it by the entire expansion of the second part, right? Because when you multiply, any term in the first expansion can be multiplied by any term in the second expansion. But since the term \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), when you multiply it by the second expansion, which involves \\(c\\) terms, the only way \\(a^2b^2\\) can appear in the product is if it's multiplied by a term that's just a constant, not involving \\(c\\). But wait, does \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) have a constant term? Let me check.\n\nSo, expanding \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem, it would be \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying that, it becomes \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the exponent on \\(c\\) is \\(6 - 2m\\). For the term to be a constant (i.e., \\(c^0\\)), we need \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). So, the constant term is when \\(m = 3\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} c^{0} = 20\\). Therefore, the constant term in the second expansion is 20. \n\nSo, going back, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion has a coefficient of 6, and it's multiplied by the entire second expansion. But since we only care about the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), we need to find how much it's multiplied by the constant term in the second expansion. Because if you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by a term involving \\(c\\), it would become something like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), which isn't what we want. So, the only contribution to \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product comes from multiplying \\(a^2b^2\\) by the constant term 20 in the second expansion. \n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 multiplied by 20, which is 120. Wait, is that correct? Let me double-check. \n\nFirst, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Then, in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the constant term is when the exponent on \\(c\\) is zero, which occurs at \\(m = 3\\), so the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, when you multiply these two parts together, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nWait, but hold on a second. Let me make sure I'm not missing anything. Because the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is a product of two separate expansions. So, when you expand this product, each term in the first expansion gets multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion will indeed be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), we have to consider how many times \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by a term that doesn't change it, i.e., the constant term in the second expansion. \n\nSo, in other words, the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is to multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion by the constant term (which is 20) from the second expansion. All other terms in the second expansion would introduce \\(c\\) terms, which would make the product have \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or similar, which isn't what we want. So, yes, the coefficient should be 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nBut wait, let me think again. Suppose I expand both parts completely. The first part is \\((a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). The second part is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which expands to \\(c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15/c^2 + 6/c^4 + 1/c^6\\). Now, when I multiply these two expansions together, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. So, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, but wait, that's not right. Because if I multiply \\(6a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, each term will have a different power of \\(c\\), so the only term that doesn't involve \\(c\\) is the constant term, which is 20. So, the only contribution to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms is \\(6 * 20 = 120\\). \n\nWait, but if I think about it another way, the entire product is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the variables \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are independent of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), it's only the part where the \\(c\\) terms cancel out. So, as before, that's only the constant term, which is 20. Therefore, the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nWait, but let me check another way. Let me consider the entire product. The product is a polynomial in \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\), and \\(1/c\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) can only come from multiplying \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part by a term that's just a constant from the second part. So, again, that's the constant term in the second expansion, which is 20. Therefore, the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of it as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the product of the coefficients of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and the constant term in the second part. So, that would be 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because sometimes when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficients can combine in different ways, but in this case, since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) is to multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term by the constant term in the second expansion. So, I think my reasoning is correct. \n\nLet me just recap to make sure I didn't miss anything. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). \n\n1. Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6.\n2. Expand \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem. The constant term (i.e., the term without \\(c\\)) is when the exponent on \\(c\\) is zero, which happens when \\(m = 3\\). The coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n3. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nI think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in that reasoning. So, the coefficient should be 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by considering the contributions from each part of the product.\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\):**  \n   Using the binomial theorem, the term with \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\\).  \n   So, the coefficient is 6.\n\n2. **Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**  \n   The constant term (where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0) occurs when \\(m = 3\\), giving \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n\n3. **Combine the results:**  \n   Multiply the coefficients from each expansion: \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer:**  \nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

    "text": " So, I need to find the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2. That would be when \\(4 - k = 2\\), so \\(k = 2\\). Therefore, the coefficient from the first part is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Let me calculate that: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. \n\nNow, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I need to consider both parts multiplied together. Wait, but the problem is only asking about the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). That means I don't need to consider the terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), right? Because \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\) at all. So, maybe the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), doesn't affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Hmm, but that doesn't seem right. Wait, no, actually, when you multiply two expressions together, every term in the first expression gets multiplied by every term in the second expression. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), we can ignore the terms in the second expression that involve \\(c\\) because they don't contribute to the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. Wait, but that might not be correct. Let me think again. \n\nWait, no, actually, when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that only has \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and no \\(c\\) terms, that means we need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and then multiply it by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because \\(c^0\\) is the only term that doesn't bring any \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\) terms, so when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), it remains \\(a^2b^2\\). So, I think that's the right approach. \n\nSo, let me first confirm that. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), and to get the overall term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, we need to multiply it by a term from the second part that doesn't have any \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\). The only such term is the constant term, which is the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. So, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nAlright, so let's expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem as well. The expansion is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying each term, that becomes \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m} = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, each term has an exponent of \\(6 - 2m\\). We need the term where the exponent is zero, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Let me compute that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). \n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficients from each part. That is, 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the second part). So, 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nWait, but let me double-check to make sure I didn't make a mistake. So, in the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6, as \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) is 6. In the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\) which is 20. Multiplying them together gives 6 * 20 = 120. That seems correct. \n\nWait, but another way to think about it is that when you multiply two expressions, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each expression, provided that the exponents add up correctly. In this case, since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the corresponding term in the second expression must be the constant term, which is \\(c^0\\), so yes, that makes sense. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of the entire product as \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), and when expanding, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by every term in the second expansion. But only the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero will contribute to the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the product, because any other term would have a \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), making it not a pure \\(a^2b^2\\) term. So, that's why I only need the constant term from the second expansion. \n\nWait, another thought: maybe I can consider that the entire expression is a product of two independent expansions, so the coefficients multiply. So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, and the coefficient for \\(c^0\\) is 20, so the product is 120. So, yeah, that seems consistent. \n\nWait, but just to make sure, maybe I can think of a specific example. Let me take a simpler case. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, expanding, \\((a^2 + 2ab + b^2) \\times (c + 1/c)\\). The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be zero because there's no \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the product. Wait, but that's a different case because the second expression is only to the first power. Hmm, maybe that's not the best example. \n\nWait, let me try another example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^1 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, the expansion is \\((a + b)(c + 1/c)\\). The coefficient of \\(a^1b^0\\) in the first part is 1, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part is zero because there's no constant term. So, the product would have no \\(a \\times c^0\\) term, so the coefficient is zero. Wait, but in our problem, the second part has a constant term, so that's why we have a non-zero coefficient. \n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me just stick to the original approach. So, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. In \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. So, when I multiply these two expressions together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is multiplied by the constant term 20 in the second part, giving 6 * 20 = 120. So, that's the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product. \n\nWait, but I just thought of another way. Maybe I can think of the entire expression as a product and use the multinomial theorem or something. But I think the approach I took is correct because I'm considering the specific terms that contribute to \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms. \n\nWait, another way to check: let me compute the entire expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) separately, then multiply them and see what the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is. But that might take too long, but perhaps for the second part, I can just compute the constant term. \n\nWait, I already did that: in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the constant term is when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, which occurs when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), so \\(m = 3\\), giving the term \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} c^0 = 20\\). So, that's correct. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120. So, the answer should be 120. \n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me consider if there's any other term that could contribute to \\(a^2b^2\\). For example, suppose I have a term in the first part, \\(a^2b^2\\), and in the second part, a term like \\(c^1\\) or \\(c^{-1}\\). But when I multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by \\(c^1\\), I get \\(a^2b^2c\\), which isn't the term we're looking for. Similarly, multiplying by \\(c^{-1}\\) gives \\(a^2b^2/c\\), which also isn't the term we're interested in. So, only the constant term in the second part contributes to \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. \n\nTherefore, I can confidently say that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is 120. \n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break down the problem into two parts using the binomial theorem.\n\nFirst, consider the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\). Using the binomial theorem, we have:\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n\\]\nThe term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\), so the coefficient is:\n\\[\n\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\n\\]\n\nNext, consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem, we have:\n\\[\n\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n\\]\nWe need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, which occurs when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(m = 3\\). The coefficient is:\n\\[\n\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\n\\]\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficients from each part:\n\\[\n6 \\times 20 = 120\n\\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

    "text": " So, I think I need to find the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2. That would correspond to \\(k = 2\\) in the binomial expansion because when \\(k = 2\\), the exponent of \\(b\\) is 2 and the exponent of \\(a\\) is \\(4 - 2 = 2\\). So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Let me compute that. \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) is 6, right? Because 4 choose 2 is 6. So, the term is \\(6a^2b^2\\). \n\nNow, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I need to consider the expansion of the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), and then multiply it by the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\). But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I think I can treat the two parts separately. That is, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by \\(c^0\\), you just get \\(a^2b^2\\). \n\nWait, why \\(c^0\\)? Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by something with \\(c\\) terms, unless the \\(c\\) terms cancel out, you'll have \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some \\(k\\), which isn't just \\(a^2b^2\\). So, to get a term with only \\(a^2b^2\\) and no \\(c\\) terms, we need the \\(c\\) terms to cancel each other out, meaning the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. So, in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), I need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. \n\nLet me apply the binomial theorem to \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The expansion is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying that, it becomes \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m}\\), which is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). \n\nSo, I need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be zero, which means \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the term where \\(m = 3\\) is the one with \\(c^0\\). The coefficient for this term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Let me compute that. \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\) is 20, right? Because 6 choose 3 is 20. So, the term is \\(20c^0 = 20\\).\n\nNow, going back to the original expression, the entire coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) will be the product of the coefficients from each part. That is, 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the second part). So, 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't miss anything. So, the first part gives me \\(6a^2b^2\\), and the second part gives me 20. So, when I multiply them together, I get \\(6a^2b^2 * 20 = 120a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient is indeed 120. \n\nIs there another way to approach this? Maybe by expanding both parts fully and then looking for the term, but that seems more complicated. Alternatively, perhaps considering generating functions or multinomial coefficients, but I think the approach I took is correct. \n\nLet me just double-check my calculations. For the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\), which seems right.

The key was recognizing that to get \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms, I needed the coefficients from both parts that contribute to that specific term.

So, the coefficient from the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), is 6. Now, the expression also has a second part: \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Hmm, so the entire expression is the product of these two parts. So, the coefficient I'm looking for is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by the coefficient from the second part. But wait, actually, no. Because the second part doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), it's in terms of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\).

Wait, no, that doesn't make sense. Because when you multiply two expressions together, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I need to consider how the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part interacts with the terms in the second part. But since the second part doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will just be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, but the coefficients will just add up. Wait, no, because the second part is a separate variable. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression will be the coefficient from the first part times the entire expansion of the second part. But wait, no, that's not correct because the second part is a separate expression. Let me think again. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, when you multiply these two, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, that means we can treat the two parts separately. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6, as I found earlier. Now, the second part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), when expanded, will have terms involving \\(c^k\\) for \\(k\\) from -6 to 6 in steps of 2, I think. But since we're multiplying by \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression will just be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Wait, no, that doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would just be the coefficient from the first part, since the second part doesn't affect \\(a\\) or \\(b\\). Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try to clarify. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the first part, and it's multiplied by the entire second part. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that can't be right because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, not an expression. Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, the expression is a product of two binomials, each raised to a power. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient from the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would be a term that includes \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by some combination of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). But perhaps the problem is expecting the coefficient as a numerical factor, treating \\(c\\) as another variable. Wait, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, that would mean we need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which is the coefficient from the first part times the entire second part. But that would make the coefficient a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the problem is likely expecting a numerical coefficient. Hmm, maybe I'm missing something. Let me try to think differently. Perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where the exponents of \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are 2, 2, and 0 respectively. That would make sense because then we're looking for a specific term in the expansion where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\), which is 1. So, in that case, we need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product. Let me try that approach. So, first, from \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, as I found earlier. Now, from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), we need the coefficient of \\(c^0\\), which is the constant term. Because when we multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by the constant term in the second part, we get \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is the term we're interested in. So, now, I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). To find the constant term, I can use the binomial theorem again. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(1/c\\right)^k\\). Simplifying each term, that becomes \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} c^{-k} = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, the exponent of \\(c\\) in each term is \\(6 - 2k\\). We need the term where the exponent is 0, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is when \\(k = 3\\), and the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20. Now, going back to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is the product of the coefficients from each part. So, that would be 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the second part), which is 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120. Wait, but let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. The problem didn't specify anything about \\(c\\), just \\(a^2b^2\\). So, maybe I'm supposed to consider all possible terms involving \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). But that would mean the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial. But that doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. So, perhaps the intended interpretation is that we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. Alternatively, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, but since \\(c\\) is separate, the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that seems unlikely because the problem is asking for a coefficient, which is usually a number. Therefore, I think the correct approach is to consider that we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. Let me just double-check my steps. First, I found the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. Then, I found the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 20. Multiplying these gives 120. That seems correct. So, I think the coefficient is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression is found by first determining the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) and then multiplying it by the constant term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\):**\n   Using the binomial theorem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n\n2. **Find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   The expansion is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\).

    "text": " So, I need to find the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) appears in the expansion. Let me think: in the expansion, each term is \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\\). So, when does \\(a^{4 - k}b^k\\) equal \\(a^2b^2\\)? That would be when \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). So, substituting \\(k = 2\\), the coefficient would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Let me compute that. \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. \n\nBut wait, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I think the coefficient I found is only part of the picture because I also have this other term \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me consider that. So, the entire expression is the product of two expansions: one in terms of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and another in terms of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). Since the problem is only asking about the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I might not need to worry about the \\(c\\) terms because they are separate variables. Wait, is that correct? Let me think. When you multiply two expressions together, each term from the first expression gets multiplied by each term from the second expression. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part will be multiplied by every term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I think that any terms involving \\(c\\) will just be coefficients attached to \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, no, that's not quite right. Let me clarify: when you multiply the two expressions, each term in the product will be a term from \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by a term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, for example, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term in the combined expression, I think that the \\(c\\) terms will affect the overall coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, but actually, no, because \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term independent of \\(c\\), right? So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that doesn't make sense because they're separate variables. Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think again. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when you multiply these two expressions, each term from \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term from \\((a + b)^4\\), and the other terms involve \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), the product terms will have both \\(a^2b^2\\) and some power of \\(c\\). However, the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). Wait, no, that can't be right because \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term in the product, but it's multiplied by terms from the other expansion, so the coefficient would actually be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part. But that doesn't make sense because the second part is in terms of \\(c\\), which is a different variable. Wait, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), because otherwise, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by various powers of \\(c\\), and the coefficient would depend on the power of \\(c\\). But the problem doesn't specify a power of \\(c\\), it just asks for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Hmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Let me read the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, perhaps the problem is considering the entire expression as a product, and \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term in the expansion, but the other part is in terms of \\(c\\), so maybe the coefficient is just the coefficient from the first part, since the second part is multiplied by it. Wait, but that can't be right because the entire expression is a product, so the coefficient would be the product of the coefficients. Let me think differently. Maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^k\\) for some \\(k\\), but it's not specified. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the entire expression as a polynomial in \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\), and \\(1/c\\), and it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). That would mean that the coefficient would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that seems a bit odd because the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) would be found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\(2^6 = 64\\). So, then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times 64, which is 384. But I'm not sure if that's what the problem is asking. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), meaning the term where the powers of \\(c\\) cancel out. That would make more sense because otherwise, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would have coefficients multiplied by various powers of \\(c\\), and the problem might be looking for the term where the \\(c\\) terms are balanced. So, perhaps I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product. That would make sense. So, let's assume that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\), meaning the constant term in the \\(c\\) expansion. So, then, the coefficient would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, let's compute both parts. First, as I found earlier, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. Now, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). To do this, I can use the binomial theorem again. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(1/c\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, which means \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), \\(6 - 2k = 0\\) \u21d2 \\(2k = 6\\) \u21d2 \\(k = 3\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6\u00d76} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire expression is the product of the two coefficients: 6 \u00d7 20 = 120. So, the coefficient is 120. Wait, but let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. So, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but in the entire expression, which includes terms with \\(c\\). So, if I consider the entire expression, each term is a product of a term from \\((a + b)^4\\) and a term from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second part, which includes various powers of \\(c\\). So, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. But the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, then the coefficient would be 6 \u00d7 64 = 384. But earlier, I thought the problem might be asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be 6 \u00d7 20 = 120. So, which one is it? The problem states: \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\)\". So, it's a bit ambiguous. If it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times any power of \\(c\\), then it's 6 \u00d7 64 = 384. But if it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it's 120. Hmm, but in the original problem statement, the user wrote: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)\". So, it's not specifying any power of \\(c\\), so perhaps it's considering all possible powers of \\(c\\). But in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 \u00d7 64 = 384. Alternatively, maybe the problem is only considering the term where the \\(c\\) terms cancel out, i.e., \\(c^0\\). But without more context, it's hard to tell. Let me check the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)\". So, perhaps the problem is considering the entire expression as a polynomial in \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\), and \\(1/c\\), and it's asking for the coefficient of the monomial \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 \u00d7 64 = 384. But wait, that doesn't make sense because the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is being multiplied by each term in the second expansion, so the coefficient would actually be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would be a coefficient in the combined expression. But in reality, in the combined expression, each term is of the form \\(a^kb^{4 - k}c^{m}\\) where \\(k\\) ranges from 0 to 4 and \\(m\\) ranges accordingly. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the combined expression would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that's not possible because the coefficient should be a constant, not a polynomial. Therefore, I think the problem must be asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where the powers of \\(c\\) cancel out. So, that would be 6 \u00d7 20 = 120. Alternatively, maybe the problem is considering the entire expression as a product, and the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the same as in \\((a + b)^4\\) because the other part is independent. But that can't be right because when you multiply by the other expansion, each term is scaled by the coefficients from that expansion. Wait, but if you're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, then the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 \u00d7 64 = 384. But that seems too large. Let me think again. Let me consider an example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^1 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, expanding, it's \\((a + b)(c + 1/c)\\). The coefficient of \\(a\\) would be 1 times the entire expansion of \\((c + 1/c)\\), which is \\(c + 1/c\\). But that's not a constant coefficient. So, perhaps in this case, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is a specific term where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out. So, that would be 6 \u00d7 20 = 120. Therefore, I think the correct approach is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product, which is 120. So, the answer should be 120. Wait, but let me confirm this. Let's compute the product step by step. First, \\((a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). Then, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) can be expanded as \\(c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15/c^2 + 6/c^4 + 1/c^6\\). Now, when we multiply these two expressions, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) in the first expression will be multiplied by each term in the second expression, resulting in terms like \\(6a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(6a^2b^2c^4\\), etc. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) would be 6 \u00d7 20 = 120, as we found earlier. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when considering the term with \\(c^0\\) is 120. But if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then it's 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 \u00d7 64 = 384. But I think that's not the case because the problem is more likely asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), which is 120. So, I think the answer is 120. Let me just recap: To find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), we first find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6. Then, we find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 20. Multiplying these together gives 6 \u00d7 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is 120. So, I think that's the answer.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is found using the binomial theorem, which gives 6. The coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found to be 20. Multiplying these together gives the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product, which is 120.\n\n\\boxed{120}"

So, the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion. Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion. But wait, the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), so that would be \\((1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\).

The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) as 6\\(a^2b^2\\), and then when you multiply it by each term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each of those terms will contribute their own coefficients. So, the total coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product will be 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is indeed 64, as I calculated before by setting \\(c = 1\\). Therefore, the coefficient would be 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nBut wait, that seems correct? Let me think again.

Because each term in the second expansion contributes its own coefficient, and when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), it just adds to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. Therefore, the total coefficient is 6 * sum of coefficients in the second expansion.\n\nAs before, the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is when \\(c = 1\\), which is \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, 6 * 64 = 384.

Let's compute the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The expansion is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). The sum of coefficients is when \\(c = 1\\), so indeed, it's \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 384.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me think about another way. Suppose I consider the entire expression as a product of two independent expansions. So, each term in the product will be a term from the first expansion multiplied by a term from the second expansion. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the sum over all possible terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any term from the second expansion. So, the coefficient is indeed the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, if I were to write the entire expansion, it would be \\(\\sum_{i=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{i} a^{4 - i}b^i \\times \\sum_{j=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{j} c^{6 - 2j}\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) times the sum over all j of \\(\\dbinom{6}{j}\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nYes, that seems correct.

    "text": " So, I think I need to find the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2. That would be when \\(4 - k = 2\\) for \\(a\\), so \\(k = 2\\). So, the coefficient would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Let me calculate that: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. But wait, the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I think I need to consider that as well. Hmm, but the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, does that mean I don't need to worry about the terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) because they are separate variables? Or does it mean I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of what's happening with \\(c\\)? Wait, the question is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so I think that part is only in the \\((a + b)^4\\) term. The other term, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), might contribute to other terms in the expansion, but since we're only focusing on \\(a^2b^2\\), maybe the coefficient is just 6 times whatever the coefficient is from the other part. Wait, but actually, when you multiply two expressions together, the coefficients multiply as well. So, if I have \\((a + b)^4\\) times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the entire expression would be the product of those two expansions. But since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are different variables, the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) don't interact with those involving \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, that doesn't seem right. Because when you multiply, each term from the first expansion gets multiplied by each term from the second expansion. So, if I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), it would be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, that can't be right because the problem is asking for a specific coefficient, not a product. Maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), and the rest of the expression, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), doesn't affect the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). So, actually, when you multiply the two expressions together, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term is multiplied by every term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\), does that mean I just need to consider the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and then multiply it by the sum of all coefficients in the second part? Wait, no, that might not be correct. Let me clarify. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression. But in the entire expression, \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are only present in the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), while \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) are only in the second part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, when you multiply these two expressions together, the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) will be multiplied by terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), but the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) will remain as they are in the first part. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part will be multiplied by every term in the second part, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), and so on, down to \\(a^2b^2c^{-6}\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, does that mean I need to sum all the coefficients from the second part and multiply by 6? Wait, no, that's not quite right. Because when you multiply by each term in the second expansion, you're adding a new term each time. But the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all coefficients from the second part. Because each term in the second expansion is a coefficient times some power of \\(c\\), and when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), it becomes a term with \\(a^2b^2\\) and that coefficient times the corresponding power of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Wait, but the second part is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). The sum of the coefficients in this expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 (from the first part) times 64 (sum of coefficients from the second part), which is 6 * 64 = 384. Wait, but I'm not sure if that's correct. Let me think again. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, meaning that for each term in the expansion, if it has \\(a^2b^2\\), we include its coefficient. But in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, so 6*64=384. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by \\(c^k\\) for some \\(k\\), but the problem doesn't specify, so I think it's just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, that would be 6*64=384. Wait, but I'm a bit confused because the problem is written as \\((a + b)^4 (c + 1/c)^6\\), so when you multiply these, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, which has terms like \\(c^6\\), \\(6c^4\\), \\(15c^2\\), \\(20\\), \\(15c^{-2}\\), \\(6c^{-4}\\), \\(c^{-6}\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient from the first part (6) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients from the second part, which is indeed 64. So, 6*64=384. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 384. Wait, but let me check that. Alternatively, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where \\(c\\) cancels out. But the problem didn't specify that, so I think it's just \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\). So, I think the answer is 384. But let me make sure. Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the \\(a^2b^2\\) term is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, so the coefficient would be 6 times each coefficient in the second expansion. But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), that would mean adding up all those contributions. So, 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, so 6*64=384. Yes, that makes sense. So, the coefficient is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(2^6 = 64\\). Multiplying these gives \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n\\(\\boxed{384}\\)"
