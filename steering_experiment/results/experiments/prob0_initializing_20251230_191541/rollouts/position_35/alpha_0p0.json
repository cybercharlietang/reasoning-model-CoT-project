Since these two terms are multiplied together, their coefficients multiply as well, so 6 * 20 = 120. That seems right. Let me see if there's another way to approach this.

    "text": " Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Let me compute that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Now, going back to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the two coefficients I found: 6 (from \\((a + b)^4\\)) and 20 (from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)). So, 6 multiplied by 20 is 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 120. Wait, let me double-check that I didn't make a mistake in my reasoning. So, I considered that the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the product of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial and the constant term in the second polynomial. That makes sense because any other term in the second polynomial would introduce a \\(c\\) term, which would mean the product term would have a \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), but since we're only interested in \\(a^2b^2\\), which has no \\(c\\), the only way to get that is by multiplying the \\(a^2b^2\\) term by the constant term in the second polynomial. So, yes, I think my reasoning is correct. Another way to think about it is that when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, if we're looking for a term that's only in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), it must come from the product of the \\(a^2b^2\\) term and the constant term in the \\(c\\) polynomial. Therefore, the coefficients multiply, giving 6 * 20 = 120. I think that's solid. So, the final answer should be 120.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break down the problem as follows:\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term containing \\(a^2b^2\\) occurs when \\(k = 2\\):\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} a^{2}b^{2} = 6a^2b^2\n   \\]\n   So, the coefficient is 6.\n\n2. **Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n   \\]\n   We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0:\n   \\[\n   6 - 2m = 0 \\implies m = 3\n   \\]\n   The coefficient is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\n   \\]\n\n3. **Multiply the coefficients from both expansions:**\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 20 = 120\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."
