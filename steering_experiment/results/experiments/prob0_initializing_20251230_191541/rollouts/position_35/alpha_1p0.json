Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 120. Wait, let me double-check that. So, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. In \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the constant term is 20. Multiplying 6 and 20 gives 120. That seems right. I don't think I made any mistakes here. So, yeah, the coefficient is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) can be found by considering each part separately and then multiplying the relevant coefficients.\n\n1. **Expanding \\((a + b)^4\\):**  \n   Using the binomial theorem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n\n2. **Expanding \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**  \n   The constant term (where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0) occurs when \\(m = 3\\), giving the coefficient \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n\n3. **Combining the coefficients:**  \n   Multiply the coefficients from each part: \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer:**  \nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}."
