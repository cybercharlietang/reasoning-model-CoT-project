So, I'm multiplying the two coefficients because when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficients multiply for the terms you're interested in. Since \\(a^2b^2\\) is only present in the first part and the constant term in the second part, their coefficients should multiply. Yes, that makes sense. So, 6 times 20 is indeed 120. I think that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of it as the entire expression being the product of two expansions, so when you multiply them, each term from the first expansion is multiplied by each term from the second. But since we're only interested in \\(a^2b^2\\), we can ignore all terms from the second expansion that have any power of \\(c\\) because they would introduce \\(c\\) terms into the product, which we don't want. So, only the constant term (i.e., \\(c^0\\)) from the second expansion will contribute to the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the product.
