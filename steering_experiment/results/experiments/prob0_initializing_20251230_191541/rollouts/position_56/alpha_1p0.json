    "text": " So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120. I think that's the answer. Let me just recap to make sure I didn't miss anything. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product of two binomials: \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Since the term \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the only way it can appear in the product is by multiplying the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first binomial by the constant term from the second binomial. The coefficient from the first part is 6, and from the second part, it's 20. Multiplying them gives 120. So, yeah, that's the answer. I don't think I made any mistakes here. The key was realizing that only the constant term from the second binomial would contribute to the \\(a^2b^2\\) term when multiplied by the corresponding term from the first binomial.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20.
