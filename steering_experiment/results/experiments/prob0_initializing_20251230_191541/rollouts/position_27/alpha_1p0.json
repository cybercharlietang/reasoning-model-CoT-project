The binomial expansion is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying each term, that becomes \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m}\\), which is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, because \\(c^0 = 1\\), which is the constant term. So, set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(6 = 2m\\), so \\(m = 3\\).

Actually, when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial.

So, the coefficient would be 6 times 20, which is indeed 120. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120. Let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes here. So, the first part: \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, that's correct because \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).

In this case, since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is to take the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from \\((a + b)^4\\) and multiply it by the constant term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).

Simplifying each term: \\(c^{6 - m} \\times c^{-m} = c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We want the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\).

Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Now, going back to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficients from each part, since we're multiplying the two expansions together. So, that would be 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the second part). So, 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120.\n\nWait, let me double-check that. So, I found that in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. Then, in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. So, when we multiply the two polynomials together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by the constant term (which is 20), giving \\(6 * 20 = 120\\). That seems right.\n\nBut just to make sure, let me think about it another way. If I were to write out the entire expansion, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would come from the product of the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first part and the constant term in the second part. There are no other ways to get \\(a^2b^2\\) because any other term from the second polynomial would have a \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), which would make the term have \\(c\\) in it, but since we're only interested in the term without \\(c\\), that's the only contribution. So yes, 6 * 20 = 120 is correct.\n\nWait, another thought: Is there a possibility that other terms from the second polynomial could combine in a way that the \\(c\\) terms cancel out, resulting in a \\(c^0\\) term? For example, could there be a term with \\(c^k\\) and another with \\(c^{-k}\\) that multiply to give \\(c^0\\)? But no, because in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term from the first polynomial is multiplied by each term from the second polynomial. So, the only way to get a term without \\(c\\) is to take the constant term from the second polynomial and multiply it by the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first polynomial. Therefore, there are no other cross terms that would result in \\(a^2b^2\\) without involving \\(c\\). So, my initial calculation stands.\n\nAlternatively, if I were to think about the entire product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be present in the expansion only once, coming from the product of the \\(a^2b^2\\) term and the constant term in the second polynomial.

So, I need to expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) and find the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. Again, I can use the binomial theorem for this. The expansion is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k\\). Simplifying that, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\times c^{-k}\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be zero, so we set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Now, going back to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the two coefficients I found: 6 (from the \\(a^2b^2\\) term) and 20 (from the \\(c^0\\) term). So, 6 multiplied by 20 is 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120. Wait, let me double-check that. So, \\((a + b)^4\\) gives \\(a^2b^2\\) with coefficient 6, and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) gives a constant term with coefficient 20. When you multiply these two, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But since we're only interested in the \\(a^2b^2\\) term, it's only the product of the \\(a^2b^2\\) term and the constant term in the second expansion. So, yes, 6 times 20 is 120. I think that's correct. So, the final answer should be 120.\n\nWait a second, but I just realized something. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product of the two expressions. But does the second expression affect the coefficients of the first? Let me think again. The first part is \\((a + b)^4\\), which gives \\(a^2b^2\\) with coefficient 6. The second part is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is multiplied by the first part. So, when you multiply these two, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. But \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term in the first expression, and when you multiply it by any term in the second expression, which is in terms of \\(c\\), you get terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2 \\times c^{-k}\\). But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would only come from the product of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expression and the constant term (i.e., \\(c^0\\)) in the second expression. Because any other term from the second expression would introduce a \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\) factor, making the term \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or similar, which is not \\(a^2b^2\\). So, only the constant term in the second expansion contributes to the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the product. Therefore, the coefficient is indeed 6 times 20, which is 120. So, I think my initial conclusion is correct. Therefore, the coefficient is 120.\n\nBut just to make sure I didn't make any mistakes, let me go through the steps again. First, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\), which is 6. Correct. Then, in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term with \\(c^0\\) is when the exponent is zero, which happens when \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), so \\(k = 3\\). The coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\), which is 20. Correct. So, the product is 6 * 20 = 120. So, yes, that's the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). I think I'm confident with this answer now.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break down the problem into two parts:\n\n1. **Finding the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\):**\n   Using the binomial theorem, the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is given by:\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\), so the coefficient is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\n   \\]\n\n2. **Finding the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   Using the binomial theorem, the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is given by:\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n   \\]\n   We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, which occurs when \\(6 - 2k = 0\\).

So, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) can be expanded using the binomial theorem as well. The general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k\\). Simplifying that, each term becomes \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} c^{-k} = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be 0, so we set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\).

So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20.

Wait, is that right? Let me double-check. So, when you have two polynomials multiplied together, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part comes from \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}a^2b^2\\), which is 6a^2b^2. The term \\(c^0\\) in the second part comes from \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}c^0\\), which is 20. So, when you multiply these two terms together, you get 6 * 20 * a^2b^2 * c^0, which is 120a^2b^2. So, the coefficient is indeed 120. Hmm, that seems straightforward, but let me make sure I didn't miss anything. Wait, could there be any other terms that, when multiplied, give an \\(a^2b^2\\) term? For example, if the second polynomial had a term without \\(c\\), but it's just a constant. So, no, because the second polynomial doesn't have any terms with \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), only \\(c\\). So, the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) is to take the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first polynomial and the constant term from the second. So, that's the only contribution. Therefore, the coefficient is 120. I think that's correct. So, the answer should be 120.\n\nWait, but let me just make sure I didn't make any calculation errors. Let me recalculate the binomial coefficients. For the first part, \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\): 4! is 24, 2! is 2, so 24/(2*2) = 24/4 = 6. That's correct. For the second part, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\): 6! is 720, 3! is 6, so 720/(6*6) = 720/36 = 20. That's correct too. So, 6 * 20 is indeed 120.

Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Now, since the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by the constant term (with \\(c^0\\)) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the total coefficient is 6 multiplied by 20. So, 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120. Wait, let me just double-check that I didn't make any mistakes. So, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6. In \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the constant term is when the exponent is 0, which happens at m=3, and that's 20. Multiplying them gives 120, so that seems correct. I don't think I missed anything here.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Multiplying these gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\boxed{120}."
