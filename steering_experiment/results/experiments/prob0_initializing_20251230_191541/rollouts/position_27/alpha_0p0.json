Now, since the two coefficients are 6 and 20, the overall coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Wait, let me double-check that. So, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, and in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. So, when you multiply these two polynomials together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. But since we're only interested in the term where the \\(c\\) exponent is 0, that's why we take 6 times 20, giving 120. That makes sense because all other terms in the second polynomial would introduce a \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\) term, which would make the product have a term with \\(c\\), but since we're only looking for \\(a^2b^2\\), those other terms don't contribute to it. So, the coefficient is 120. I think that's it. So, the final answer is 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem.\n\nFirst, consider the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n\\]\nThe term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\), so the coefficient is:\n\\[\n\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\n\\]\n\nNext, consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem:\n\\[\n\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n\\]\nWe need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, which occurs when \\(6 - 2k = 0\\).

Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120.\n\nWait, let me double-check to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. So, first, I expanded \\((a + b)^4\\) and found that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. Then, I considered \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) and found that the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Then, I multiplied 6 and 20 to get 120. That seems right. Alternatively, I can think of the entire expression as the product of two separate expansions, so when you multiply them, the terms combine. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is multiplied by every term in the second part. But since we're only interested in the terms where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out (i.e., \\(c^0\\)), only the term with \\(c^0\\) from the second part will contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, yes, that makes sense. So, I think 120 is the correct coefficient.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is found using the binomial coefficient \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). For \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying these gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\boxed{120}"

We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, because \\(c^0 = 1\\), which is the constant term. So, set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\).

So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the term \\(c^0\\) in the other expansion is 20, so when you multiply them, you get 6 * 20 = 120. That seems right.

Then, for the \\(c\\) part, you need \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which gives \\(m = 3\\) and the coefficient 20. So, the product term is 6 * 20 * \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120 \\(a^2b^2\\).

    "text": " 2. The coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me work on that second part. So, expanding \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem again. The expansion would be \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying that, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m} = \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), \\(6 = 2m\\) so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Now, since the original expression is the product of \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the product of the coefficients we found: 6 (from \\(a^2b^2\\)) times 20 (from \\(c^0\\)). So, 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is 120. Wait, let me just double-check that I didn't make any mistakes in my reasoning. So, first, I found the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) correctly as 6. Then, for the second part, I correctly identified that we need the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which occurs when the exponent is 0, so \\(m = 3\\), and that binomial coefficient is indeed 20. Multiplying 6 and 20 gives 120, which seems correct. I don't think I made any errors in the calculations. So, yeah, the final answer should be 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is found using the binomial theorem, which gives \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). For the expression \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the constant term (where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0) occurs at \\(m = 3\\), giving \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying these coefficients together, \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\boxed{120}."

The expression \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) can be expanded using the binomial theorem as well. So, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying each term, that becomes \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m} = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). Now, we need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, because that's the constant term. So, we set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), and solve for \\(m\\): \\(6 - 2m = 0\\) \u2192 \\(2m = 6\\) \u2192 \\(m = 3\\). So, the term where \\(m = 3\\) is the constant term. The coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Now, going back to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is the product of the two coefficients we found. That is, 6 (from the \\(a^2b^2\\) term) multiplied by 20 (from the constant term in the \\(c\\) expansion). So, 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120. Wait, let me double-check to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. First, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).
