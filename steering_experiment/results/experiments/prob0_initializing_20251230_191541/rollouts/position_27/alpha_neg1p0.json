Multiplying them gives 120. Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe I can think about it differently. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), the terms in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) don't interfere with the terms in \\(c\\). So, when we multiply, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion.

So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from multiplying the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first part by the constant term in the second part. Since the second part doesn't have any \\(a\\) or \\(b\\) terms, it's just a scalar multiple when considering the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) part. So, yes, the coefficient would be 6 * 20 = 120.

So, when you multiply 6a\u00b2b\u00b2 by 20, you get 120a\u00b2b\u00b2 plus other terms involving \\(c\\). But since the question is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is 120, that's the answer. I think that's correct. Let me see if there's another way to approach this. Another way is to consider that the entire expression is a product of two independent binomial expansions. So, when you multiply them, each term from the first expansion is multiplied by each term from the second. However, since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), we can ignore all the terms from the second expansion that involve \\(c\\) because they won't contribute to the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. Only the constant term from the second expansion (i.e., the term with \\(c^0\\)) will multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first expansion. Therefore, the coefficient is indeed the product of the two coefficients: 6 * 20 = 120. I don't see any mistakes in this reasoning. So, I think the answer is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is found by multiplying the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\n1. In \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n2. In \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n3. Multiplying these gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\boxed{120}."

    "text": " 2. The coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me tackle the second part now. Expanding \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem: \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m - m} = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so we set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Now, going back to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficients from each part, since we're multiplying the two expansions together. So, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Wait, is that right? Let me double-check. So, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. In \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. When you multiply these two parts together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), it's only the term where the second expansion contributes a constant term. So, yes, the total coefficient is indeed 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.
