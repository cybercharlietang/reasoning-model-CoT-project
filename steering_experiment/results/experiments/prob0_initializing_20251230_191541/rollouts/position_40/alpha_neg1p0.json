    "text": " Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120.\n\nWait, let me double-check that. So, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6, that's correct because \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). For \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0 occurs when \\(m = 3\\), so \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\), which is correct. Multiplying 6 and 20 gives 120. Hmm, that seems right. But wait, let me think again. The problem is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, when we multiply these two, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion is multiplied by the term \\(c^0\\) from the second expansion, which is 1 (the constant term). So, the coefficient would be 6 (from \\(a^2b^2\\)) times 20 (from \\(c^0\\)), giving 120. Yes, that makes sense. Alternatively, if I were to expand the entire expression, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) would be 6 * 20 = 120. So, I think that's correct.\n\nBut just to make sure, let me think about it another way. Suppose I consider the entire expansion as a product of two separate expansions. The first expansion is in terms of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the second is in terms of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). Since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are different variables, their exponents don't interfere with each other. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would only come from the product of the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first part and the term that gives \\(c^0\\) in the second part. So, yes, that's exactly what I did earlier. So, I think I'm confident that the coefficient is 120.\n\nWait, another thought: sometimes when variables are multiplied, there might be cross terms, but in this case, since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are separate variables, the exponents don't combine in a way that affects each other. So, I don't need to worry about any interaction between \\(a\\) and \\(c\\) or \\(b\\) and \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just the product of the coefficients from each expansion where the exponents match the required term. So, that's 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nI think I've covered all the bases here. I used the binomial theorem correctly for both expansions, identified the correct coefficients, and multiplied them together. So, I'm pretty sure the answer is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is found using the binomial coefficient \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). For \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying these gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\boxed{120}"
