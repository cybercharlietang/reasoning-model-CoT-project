    "text": " \n\nWait, let me double-check to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. So, in the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). That seems right. Then, for \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), I'm looking for the constant term, which occurs when the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0. So, using the binomial expansion, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\times \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). Setting \\(6 - 2m = 0\\) gives \\(m = 3\\). So, the term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\), which is correct. Then, multiplying 6 and 20 together gives 120. Hmm, that seems straightforward. I don't think I made any errors here. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is 120. \n\nWait, but let me think again. Is there a possibility that I'm supposed to consider other terms? For example, could there be a term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) that, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), doesn't involve \\(c\\)? But no, because any term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) that isn't the constant term would have a power of \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), which would make the entire product have a \\(c\\) term. Since we're only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't have any \\(c\\) terms, the only way that can happen is if we multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by the constant term in the second polynomial. So, I think my reasoning holds. Therefore, the coefficient is indeed 6 multiplied by 20, which is 120.\n\nI think that's the correct answer.

The coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) is:\n\\[\n\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\n\\]\n\nNext, we consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem:\n\\[\n\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n\\]\nWe need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, which occurs when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\).

    "text": " So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 120. Wait, let me just make sure I didn't make a mistake here. So, the key idea is that when you multiply two expressions together, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each expression, provided that the variables multiply to give the desired term. In this case, since we're looking for \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), the only way to get that term is by multiplying the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part by the constant term from the second part. So, yes, that makes sense. Therefore, the coefficient is indeed 6 times 20, which is 120. I don't think I made any calculation errors here. Let me just double-check the binomial coefficients. For \\((a + b)^4\\), \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\), which is correct. For \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term where \\(m = 3\\) gives the exponent \\(6 - 2*3 = 0\\), so that's correct, and \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\), which is also correct. So, 6 times 20 is 120. I think that's the right answer.\n\nWait a second, let me think again. The problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. So, maybe I should consider whether the entire expression is being expanded, but perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Let me try a different approach to verify.\n\nAnother way to approach this is to consider the entire expansion. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). When expanding, each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by every term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), the only term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) that contributes is the constant term, as I thought earlier. So, that confirms that the coefficient is indeed 6 times 20, which is 120.\n\nWait, but let me make sure that I'm not missing something. Could there be other terms that, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), result in \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms? No, because any other term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) would have a \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\) factor, which would make the product have \\(c\\) terms, but \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't have any \\(c\\) terms. So, only the constant term in the second polynomial contributes to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the coefficient is 6 times 20, which is 120. Therefore, the final answer should be 120.\n\nWait, but just to be thorough, let me write out the expansions more explicitly. For \\((a + b)^4\\), the expansion is \\(a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6.\n\nFor \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the expansion is:\n\n\\[\n\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\times \\left(1/c\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n\\]\n\nSo, the terms are:\n\n- \\(m = 0\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{0} c^6 = 1 \\times c^6\\)\n- \\(m = 1\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{1} c^{4} = 6c^4\\)\n- \\(m = 2\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{2} c^{2} = 15c^2\\)\n- \\(m = 3\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} c^{0} = 20\\)\n- \\(m = 4\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{4} c^{-2} = 15c^{-2}\\)\n- \\(m = 5\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{5} c^{-4} = 6c^{-4}\\)\n- \\(m = 6\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{6} c^{-6} = 1c^{-6}\\)\n\nSo, the constant term is indeed 20, as I found earlier.\n\nNow, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in the first polynomial gets multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first polynomial will be multiplied by each term in the second polynomial, giving terms like \\(6a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(6a^2b^2c^4\\), \\(6a^2b^2c^2\\), \\(6a^2b^2 \\times 20\\), \\(6a^2b^2c^{-2}\\), etc. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), we need to consider only the term where the \\(c\\) exponent is 0. That's the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by 20, giving \\(6 \\times 20 a^2b^2 = 120a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient is 120.\n\nWait, but let me just make sure that there isn't a mistake in the way I'm combining the terms. So, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by every term in the second polynomial, but only the term with \\(c^0\\) will result in a term that's just \\(a^2b^2\\). All other terms will have \\(c\\) raised to some power, which we don't want. So, the only contribution to \\(a^2b^2\\) is from the product of \\(a^2b^2\\) and the constant term in the second polynomial, which is 20. So, 6 times 20 is indeed 120.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of it as the entire product being \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), and since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are different variables, the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is by taking \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part and \\(c^0\\) from the second part. So, the coefficient is the product of the coefficients from each part, which is 6 times 20, as before.\n\nI think that's solid. So, the coefficient is 120. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning. So, I'm confident that the answer is 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break down the problem into two parts using the binomial theorem.\n\n1. **Expanding \\((a + b)^4\\)**:\n   Using the binomial theorem, we know that:\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\), so the coefficient is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\n   \\]\n\n2. **Expanding \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)**:\n   Using the binomial theorem, we know that:\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n   \\]\n   We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, which occurs when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\).

The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficients multiply when the variables match. But in this case, the first polynomial has variables \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the second has variables \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, when you multiply them, the variables don't interfere with each other. That means the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial will only be multiplied by the constant term in the second polynomial, because any other term in the second polynomial would have a \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\) factor, which would make the product have those variables as well. Since we're only interested in \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't include \\(c\\), we only take the constant term from the second polynomial. So, that's why we multiply 6 by 20 to get 120.

Let's see, \\((a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6.

But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), we only consider the term where the second factor is 20. So, the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120. Yeah, that seems right. I think I've got it.

For \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term with \\(c^0\\) occurs when the exponent from \\(c\\) and the exponent from \\(1/c\\) cancel each other out. So, as I did before, setting \\(6 - 2m = 0\\) gives \\(m = 3\\), and the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying these together gives 6 * 20 = 120. That seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of the entire expression as a product of two independent expansions. Since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are in one part and \\(c\\) is in the other, the terms in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) don't interact with the terms in \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is just the product of the coefficients from each expansion, as I reasoned before.\n\nWait, just to make sure I'm not missing anything, let me write out the expansions a bit more explicitly. \n\nFirst, expanding \\((a + b)^4\\):\n\n- The terms are \\(a^4, 4a^3b, 6a^2b^2, 4ab^3, b^4\\).\n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6.\n\nNow, expanding \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):\n\n- The expansion will have terms from \\(c^6\\) down to \\(c^{-6}\\), each with their respective coefficients.\n\nThe general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\).\n\nWe need the term where the exponent is 0, so as before, \\(6 - 2m = 0\\) implies \\(m = 3\\), so the term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} c^0 = 20\\).\n\nTherefore, when we multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion will be multiplied by 20, resulting in \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\) as the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\).\n\nWait, let me consider if there's any other term that could contribute to \\(a^2b^2\\) when multiplied by the second expression. For example, could a term with \\(a^3b\\) from the first expansion, when multiplied by a term in the second expansion, result in \\(a^2b^2\\)? But that doesn't make sense because the second expansion is in terms of \\(c\\), which doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\). So, any term from the second expansion is just a constant (with respect to \\(a\\) and \\(b\\)) coefficient. Therefore, the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) is by taking the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first expansion and multiplying it by the constant term from the second expansion. There's no way for other terms to combine to form \\(a^2b^2\\) because the second expansion doesn't have any \\(a\\) or \\(b\\) terms. So, I think my initial reasoning holds.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of the entire expression as a product of two polynomials and consider how the coefficients multiply. Let me represent the first polynomial as \\(P(a, b) = (a + b)^4\\) and the second as \\(Q(c) = \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Then, the product \\(P(a, b) \\times Q(c)\\) would have terms where each term from \\(P(a, b)\\) is multiplied by each term from \\(Q(c)\\). Since \\(Q(c)\\) only involves \\(c\\), it doesn't affect the exponents of \\(a\\) or \\(b\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(P(a, b)\\) multiplied by the entire \\(Q(c)\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is independent of \\(c\\), we can consider that coefficient as being multiplied by the constant term (i.e., the term with \\(c^0\\)) of \\(Q(c)\\). Therefore, the coefficient is 6 (from \\(P(a, b)\\)) multiplied by 20 (the constant term from \\(Q(c)\\)), giving 120.\n\nWait, let me just think if there's another way to approach this problem. Maybe using multinomial coefficients or generating functions? But I think the binomial approach is straightforward here since each part is a binomial expression.\n\nAnother way to check is to consider that when you have two independent variables, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the product of the coefficients from each part. So, since \\(a^2b^2\\) is in the first part and the constant term is in the second part, their product gives the term \\(a^2b^2\\) with the coefficient being the product of the two coefficients.\n\nWait, perhaps I can also compute the entire expansion, but that would be time-consuming. Alternatively, I can use the fact that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 and the constant term in the second expansion is 20, so their product is 120. Therefore, the coefficient is 120.\n\nI think that makes sense. Let me just recapitulate the steps:\n\n1. Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6.\n\n2. Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem. The constant term (where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0) is found when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which gives \\(m = 3\\). The coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n\n3. Multiply these two coefficients together: 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 120.\n\nI don't think I made any mistakes in the calculations. Both binomial coefficients were computed correctly, and the reasoning about the product of coefficients seems solid. So, I'm confident that the answer is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is found by considering the binomial expansions of each part and multiplying the relevant coefficients. \n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\):**\n   - The term \\(a^2b^2\\) has a coefficient of \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n\n2. **Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   - The constant term (where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0) occurs at \\(m = 3\\), giving a coefficient of \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n\n3. **Multiply the coefficients:**\n   - \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

For example, could there be a case where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by a term from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) that also has \\(c^0\\), thus contributing to the coefficient? But I think that's exactly what I did.

But since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are different variables, their exponents are independent. So, when multiplying the two polynomials, the only way to get a term with \\(a^2b^2\\) is to multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first polynomial by the constant term from the second polynomial. So, that reinforces my earlier conclusion.\n\nJust to be thorough, let me write out the expansions more explicitly.

First, I found the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) as 6, which seems right because \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Then, I needed the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem, the exponent of \\(c\\) in each term is \\(6 - 2m\\), so setting that equal to 0 gives \\(m = 3\\), and \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, 6 times 20 is indeed 120. Wait, but I want to make sure that I didn't miss anything in the problem. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but in the expression \\((a + b)^4 (c + 1/c)^6\\), so when you multiply them, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\((c + 1/c)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first part and the \\(c^0\\) term in the second part. Therefore, their coefficients multiply. So, 6 times 20 is 120. I think that's correct. So, the coefficient is 120. Wait, but let me think again. Is there a possibility that other terms in \\((c + 1/c)^6\\) could contribute to \\(a^2b^2\\) when multiplied by other terms in \\((a + b)^4\\)? For example, if I take a term with \\(c^1\\) from the second part and multiply it by a term with \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part, that would give me a term like \\(a^2b^2c\\), which isn't \\(a^2b^2\\). Similarly, taking a term with \\(c^{-1}\\) would give \\(a^2b^2/c\\), which also isn't \\(a^2b^2\\). So, only the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0 in the second part will contribute to the \\(a^2b^2\\) term when multiplied by the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part. Therefore, I don't need to consider any other terms from the second part. So, my initial calculation seems correct. Therefore, the coefficient is 120.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't misinterpret the problem. The problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). But in the product, \\(a^2b^2\\) would only come from the product of the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first polynomial and the constant term in the second polynomial, because any other term would introduce a \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\) term, making the product have \\(c\\) involved, which is not part of \\(a^2b^2\\).

The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product of \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, when you multiply these two expressions, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. However, since we're only interested in the term that results in \\(a^2b^2\\), and that term must come from the product of the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first polynomial and the constant term in the second polynomial.

Let me denote \\(A = (a + b)^4\\) and \\(B = \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the product is \\(A \\times B\\). When expanding \\(A\\), the term with \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(6a^2b^2\\). When expanding \\(B\\), the term with \\(c^0\\) is \\(20c^0\\), which is just 20. So, when you multiply \\(6a^2b^2\\) by \\(20\\), you get \\(120a^2b^2\\).

    "text": " Wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake here. Let me double-check each step. First, expanding \\((a + b)^4\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) has the coefficient \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). That seems correct. Then, for \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), I used the binomial theorem and found that the term with \\(c^0\\) is when the exponent is 0, which occurs at \\(m = 3\\), giving the coefficient \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying 6 and 20 gives 120. That seems right. Alternatively, another way to think about it is that when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each polynomial, provided their variables don't interfere. In this case, since \\(a^2b^2\\) is independent of \\(c\\), the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is by taking \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part and \\(c^0\\) from the second part. So, yeah, that makes sense. So, I think the answer is 120. Wait, but let me just make sure I didn't overlook anything. Let me think about it another way. Suppose I consider the entire expansion of both parts. The first part is \\((a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). The second part is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Let me compute that as well to check. Using the binomial theorem, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} (1/c)^m = \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the terms are:\n\n- \\(m=0\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{0}c^6 = 1 \\times c^6\\)\n- \\(m=1\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{1}c^{4} = 6c^4\\)\n- \\(m=2\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{2}c^{2} = 15c^2\\)\n- \\(m=3\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}c^{0} = 20\\)\n- \\(m=4\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{4}c^{-2} = 15c^{-2}\\)\n- \\(m=5\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{5}c^{-4} = 6c^{-4}\\)\n- \\(m=6\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{6}c^{-6} = 1c^{-6}\\)\n\nSo, the second polynomial is \\(c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15/c^2 + 6/c^4 + 1/c^6\\).\n\nNow, when we multiply the first polynomial by the second, each term in the first will multiply each term in the second. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is 6a^2b^2, we need to see what happens when we multiply 6a^2b^2 by each term in the second polynomial. But since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't have any \\(c\\) terms, the only way to get a term that is just \\(a^2b^2\\) (without any \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\) terms) is to multiply 6a^2b^2 by the constant term 20 in the second polynomial. Because multiplying by any other term would introduce a \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\) term, which would make the product have terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\) or \\(a^2b^2/c^4\\), etc., but not just \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient would be 6 * 20 = 120. That seems consistent with what I found earlier. So, I think I'm confident that the coefficient is 120.\n\nWait, but let me just check if there's another way to approach this problem. Maybe using generating functions or considering the product more directly. Alternatively, perhaps I can think of it as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\), which is exactly what I did. So, yeah, that approach seems solid.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to recognize that in the product of two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each polynomial. Since \\(a^2b^2\\) is in the first polynomial and \\(c^0\\) is in the second, their product gives the term \\(a^2b^2\\) with the coefficient being the product of the two coefficients. So, 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me write out the product in more detail. So, the first polynomial is \\(a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\), and the second is \\(c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15/c^2 + 6/c^4 + 1/c^6\\). When we multiply these, each term from the first polynomial will multiply each term from the second. So, for example, \\(a^4 \\times c^6 = a^4c^6\\), \\(a^4 \\times 6c^4 = 6a^4c^4\\), and so on. But the term we're interested in is \\(a^2b^2\\). So, in the product, the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms is to take \\(6a^2b^2\\) from the first polynomial and multiply it by the constant term \\(20\\) from the second polynomial. So, \\(6a^2b^2 \\times 20 = 120a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient is 120.\n\nWait, but I just thought of something else. Is it possible that when multiplying, some other terms might combine to give \\(a^2b^2\\) without involving \\(c\\)? For example, if there's a term with \\(c\\) that cancels out, but that seems unlikely because \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) are separate variables, so their exponents don't affect the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). So, each term in the product will have some combination of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) from the first polynomial and some combination of \\(c\\) from the second. Therefore, the only way to get a term that is purely \\(a^2b^2\\) is to multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term by the constant term in the second polynomial. So, that seems to confirm that the coefficient is indeed 120.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of it as a generating function problem, where I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product. But since \\(c\\) is independent, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is the product of the coefficients of \\(a^2b^2\\) and \\(c^0\\) in each part. So, that would again be 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nI think I've covered all the angles here. I can't see any mistakes in my reasoning, so I'm pretty confident that the answer is 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break down the problem into two parts:\n\n1. **Expanding \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\), so the coefficient is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\n   \\]\n\n2. **Expanding \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n   \\]\n   We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, which occurs when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\).

First, I found that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, which seems correct because \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Then, for the second part, I needed the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). I used the binomial theorem and found that when \\(m = 3\\), the exponent is 0, so the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). That also seems correct. Then, multiplying 6 and 20 gives 120. \n\nWait, but let me think again. When you multiply two polynomials, each term from the first polynomial is multiplied by each term from the second polynomial. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by every term in the second polynomial. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), we need to consider how the terms interact. However, the second polynomial is in terms of \\(c\\), which is a different variable, so when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by any term in the second polynomial, it will create terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2 \\cdot c^{-k}\\), but none of these will affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) itself because they all have additional factors of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is indeed the product of the coefficients from each part, as I thought earlier. So, 6 times 20 is 120. \n\nI think that makes sense. Let me try another approach to verify. Alternatively, I can think of the entire expression as a product of two independent expansions. So, the first expansion is \\((a + b)^4\\) and the second is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Since these are multiplied together, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), we can consider that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion multiplied by the entire second expansion evaluated at \\(c^0\\), which is the constant term. Therefore, the coefficient is 6 times 20, which is 120. \n\nWait, another thought: sometimes when multiplying polynomials, cross terms can contribute to the same term, but in this case, since the second polynomial doesn't have any \\(a\\) or \\(b\\) terms, it's just a constant factor for each term in the first polynomial. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial times the entire second polynomial. But since the second polynomial is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is a sum of terms involving \\(c\\), when we multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), it just becomes \\(a^2b^2\\) times that entire sum. But since we're only interested in the coefficient, and not the entire expression, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) is just the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Wait, no, that's not quite right because the second polynomial isn't a sum of constants; it's a sum of terms with different powers of \\(c\\). So, when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second polynomial, each product will have a different power of \\(c\\). Therefore, the only way \\(a^2b^2\\) can appear without any \\(c\\) terms is if we multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by the term in the second polynomial that has \\(c^0\\). So, that term is the constant term, which we found to be 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times 20, which is 120. \n\nI think that's solid. So, to recap: the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). \n\nI don't see any mistakes in this reasoning. It seems straightforward once you break it down into parts. First, handle the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) part, then handle the \\(c\\) part, and then multiply the relevant coefficients together.

I think the approach I took is correct because it's considering each part separately and then multiplying the relevant coefficients.

So, for example, a term like \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion multiplied by \\(c^0\\) from the second expansion gives \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is just \\(a^2b^2\\). Any other term from the second expansion would include a \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), so the product would have those variables as well.

Calculating that coefficient gave me 20. Multiplying these two coefficients together, 6 and 20, gives 120. I think that makes sense because when you expand both parts, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part will be multiplied by the constant term from the second part, resulting in \\(a^2b^2 \\times c^0\\), which is just \\(a^2b^2\\), and the coefficient is the product of the two coefficients.

The expression is the product of two binomials raised to powers.
