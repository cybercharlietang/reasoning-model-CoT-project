But since \\(a^2b^2\\) is only from the first part, and the second part must contribute a term with \\(c^0\\), which is 1, so yes, the only contribution is from the \\(a^2b^2\\) term multiplied by the constant term in the second polynomial.

First, I correctly identified that in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. Then, I correctly expanded \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) and found that the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Since when multiplying two polynomials, the coefficient of a term is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each polynomial, and since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is by multiplying the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first polynomial with the constant term from the second polynomial. So, 6 * 20 = 120. Yep, that seems correct.

First, I correctly identified that to get \\(a^2b^2\\), I needed the term where \\(k=2\\) in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\), which gave me 6. Then, for the second part, I correctly expanded \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) and found the term where the exponent is 0, which occurs at \\(k=3\\), giving me 20. Multiplying 6 and 20 gives 120. Yeah, that seems right. I don't think I made any calculation errors here. So, I'm confident that the coefficient is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is found by multiplying the coefficients from each part of the expression. From \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient is 6, and from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Multiplying these gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\boxed{120}"

The expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying that, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m} = \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the exponent of \\(c\\) in each term is \\(6 - 2m\\). We need to find the term where the exponent is 0, so we set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the term with \\(c^0\\) is when \\(m = 3\\), and its coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Now, going back to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the two coefficients I found: 6 (from \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\)) and 20 (from \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)). So, 6 multiplied by 20 is 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is 120. Wait, let me double-check that. So, \\((a + b)^4\\) gives 6 for \\(a^2b^2\\), and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) gives 20 for \\(c^0\\). Multiplying them together, 6*20=120. Yeah, that seems correct. I don't think I made a mistake in the calculations.

Multiplying these coefficients together, \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\(\\boxed{120}\\)"

    "text": " So, let's tackle the second part: finding the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Again, I can use the binomial theorem here. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k\\).

So, each term has an exponent of \\(6 - 2k\\) on \\(c\\). We need the term where the exponent is 0, because that's the constant term. So, set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\) and solve for \\(k\\). That gives \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\).

    "text": " So, let's focus on finding the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Again, I can use the binomial theorem for this. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\).

So, each term has an exponent of \\(c\\) equal to \\(6 - 2m\\). We need the term where the exponent is 0, because \\(c^0 = 1\\), which is the constant term. So, set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\).

Now, going back to the original expression, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the other part is 20. Since these two terms are multiplied together in the product, the overall coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Wait, let me double-check that. So, when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a^2b^2)\\) in the first part and \\(1\\) (the constant term) in the second part. So, yes, the coefficients multiply. So, 6 times 20 is indeed 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120. I think that's it. Let me just recap to make sure I didn't miss anything. The problem was to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product of \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are in the first part and \\(c\\) is in the second, the only way to get a term with \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms is by multiplying the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part by the constant term from the second part. The coefficients are 6 and 20, so multiplying them gives 120. Yeah, that makes sense. I don't think I made any mistakes here.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is found using the binomial coefficient \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). For the term \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the constant term (exponent 0) occurs at \\(m = 3\\), giving the coefficient \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying these coefficients together gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\boxed{120}."
