Wait, let me double-check that. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\) with coefficient 6, and the term \\(c^0\\) comes from the other expansion with coefficient 20. When you multiply these two, you get \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\) for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2 \\times c^0\\), which is just \\(a^2b^2\\). So, yeah, that seems correct. I don't think I made any mistakes here. Let me just recap: 1. Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using binomial theorem, find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is 6. 2. Expand \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) using binomial theorem, find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\), which is 20. 3. Multiply the two coefficients together to get 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is 120.\n\nWait, hold on a second. Let me think again. When you multiply two expressions, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expression is multiplied by every term in the second expression. But since the second expression has terms with \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), unless we're looking for a term that's multiplied by \\(c^0\\), the other terms would introduce \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\) factors, which would make the overall term have \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), which we don't want because we're only interested in \\(a^2b^2\\). So, yes, only the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero in the second expression would contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. So, I think my reasoning is correct.

We need the term where the exponent is 0, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Now, going back to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Since these two terms are multiplied together in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) (which comes from the product of \\(a^2b^2\\) and \\(c^0\\)) is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Wait, but let me double-check that. So, when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficients multiply when the variables don't interfere. So, in this case, since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), the terms involving \\(a^2b^2\\) will only come from the product of the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first polynomial and the constant term in the second polynomial. So, yes, that makes sense. So, 6 times 20 is indeed 120. Therefore, the coefficient is 120. Hmm, I think that's correct. Let me just recap to make sure I didn't miss anything. We have two separate polynomials: one in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and another in \\(c\\). We're looking for the coefficient of a term that only involves \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), specifically \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the \\(c\\) terms in the second polynomial don't affect this coefficient, except for the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, because that's the only term that doesn't introduce any \\(c\\) into the product. So, by finding the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second polynomial, and then multiplying them together, I get the desired coefficient. So, yes, 6 times 20 is 120. I don't think I made any mistakes in the calculations. The binomial coefficients were calculated correctly, and the exponents were handled properly. So, I'm confident that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is found using the binomial theorem, which gives us 6. The coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found to be 20. Multiplying these together gives the final coefficient of 120.\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}."

So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by every term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), that means we need to find the term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) that is a constant (i.e., \\(c^0\\)), because any other term would introduce a \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\) factor, making the entire product have a term like \\(a^2b^2c\\) or \\(a^2b^2/c\\), which isn't what we're looking for. So, yes, only the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) will contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when multiplied by the corresponding term in \\((a + b)^4\\).

Now, going back to the original expression, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Since these two terms are multiplied together in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the overall coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) (since the \\(c\\) terms are all zero except for the constant term) would be 6 multiplied by 20. Let me compute that: 6 * 20 = 120. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is 120. Wait, let me double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake. First, expanding \\((a + b)^4\\) and finding the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\): that's \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\), which is 6. That seems correct. Then, expanding \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), looking for the constant term. The exponent is \\(6 - 2m\\), set to 0, so \\(m = 3\\), which gives \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). That seems correct too. Multiplying 6 and 20 gives 120. Hmm, that seems straightforward. Is there any chance I missed something? Let me think: the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and since the two polynomials are multiplied together, the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) is by taking the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part and the constant term from the second part. Because if you take any other term from the second polynomial, it would introduce a \\(c\\) term, which would make the product have a term like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), which isn't what we're looking for. So, yes, I think 120 is correct. I don't see any errors in my reasoning, so I'm confident that the coefficient is 120.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break down the problem into two parts:\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\):\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} a^{2}b^{2} = 6a^2b^2\n   \\]\n   So, the coefficient is 6.\n\n2. **Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n   \\]\n   We need the constant term (\\(c^0\\)):\n   \\[\n   6 - 2m = 0 \\implies m = 3\n   \\]\n   The coefficient is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\n   \\]\n\n3. **Multiply the coefficients:**\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is:\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 20 = 120\n   \\]\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

Simplifying each term, that becomes \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m} = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). Now, I need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be 0, so I set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(6 = 2m\\) so \\(m = 3\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\).

Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is 120.\n\nWait, let me double-check to make sure I didn't make a mistake. So, the binomial coefficients: for \\((a + b)^4\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). For \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term with \\(c^0\\) is when the exponent is zero, which happens at \\(m = 3\\), and \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying these together gives 6 * 20 = 120. That seems right. I don't think I made any calculation errors here. So, yeah, the coefficient should be 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem.\n\nFirst, we expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n\\]\nThe term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\), so the coefficient is:\n\\[\n\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\n\\]\n\nNext, we consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem:\n\\[\n\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n\\]\nWe need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, which occurs when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\).
