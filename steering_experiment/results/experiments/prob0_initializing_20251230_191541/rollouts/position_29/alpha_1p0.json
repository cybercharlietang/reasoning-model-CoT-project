So, in the product, each term from \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\).

The binomial theorem states that \\((x + y)^n = \\sum_{k=0}^{n} \\dbinom{n}{k} x^{n - k} y^k\\). In this case, \\(x = c\\) and \\(y = \\dfrac{1}{c}\\), and \\(n = 6\\). So, the expansion is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k\\). Simplifying the exponents, \\(c^{6 - k} \\times \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = c^{6 - k} \\times c^{-k} = c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\).

Let me calculate that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Now, going back to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Therefore, when we multiply these two expressions together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by 20, because the \\(c^0\\) term is 20. So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Wait, let me double-check that. So, the first part gives 6, the second part gives 20, and since we're looking for \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), which is just 1, so the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120. That seems right. Alternatively, maybe I can think of it as the product of the two coefficients because when you multiply the two polynomials, each term from the first is multiplied by each term from the second, so the coefficients multiply as well. So, yeah, I think 120 is the correct coefficient.\n\nWait, hold on a second, maybe I'm making a mistake here. Let me think again. The problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when I expand this product, each term from \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by every term in the second part. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), we need to find the sum of all products where the term from the second polynomial is \\(c^0\\), because any other term would introduce a \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\) factor, making the entire term have a \\(c\\) component, which we don't want. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) that are multiplied by \\(c^0\\). But in this case, the only term that contributes to \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms is the term where \\(c^0\\) is multiplied. So, it's just the product of 6 and 20, which is 120. Wait, but maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think differently. Alternatively, perhaps I can consider that the entire expression is the product of two independent expansions, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is just the product of the coefficients from each part, because the \\(c\\) terms don't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. So, in other words, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the coefficient in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 20 = 120. That makes sense. So, I think that's correct.\n\nWait, another way to check is to consider that the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4\\) times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\), and it's multiplied by every term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), we need to find the term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) that is a constant term (i.e., \\(c^0\\)) because any other term would introduce a power of \\(c\\), which would make the entire term have a \\(c\\) component, which we don't want. Therefore, the coefficient is indeed the product of the two coefficients: 6 from \\((a + b)^4\\) and 20 from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), giving 120. So, I think that's the correct answer.\n\nWait, just to make sure, let me try to compute \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) and see if the constant term is indeed 20. Using the binomial expansion, the general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\times (1/c)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, when \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), \\(k = 3\\). So, the term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} c^0 = 20\\). Yep, that's correct. So, the constant term is 20. Therefore, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can think of the entire expression as a product of two independent expansions. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is independent of the \\(c\\) terms, so it's just the product of the coefficients from each part. So, yeah, 6 * 20 = 120. I think that's solid.\n\nWait, just to make sure, let me consider a simpler example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). What's the coefficient of \\(a^1b^1\\)? Well, in \\((a + b)^2\\), the coefficient of \\(ab\\) is 2. In \\((c + 1/c)^1\\), the constant term is when \\(k = 0.5\\), but wait, \\(k\\) has to be an integer. Wait, no, in this case, \\((c + 1/c)^1\\) expands to \\(c + 1/c\\), so there is no constant term. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(ab\\) in the product would be 2 * 0 (since there's no constant term) = 0. Hmm, but if I compute the product, \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)\\), the \\(ab\\) term would be multiplied by both \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), so the terms would be \\(ab \\times c\\) and \\(ab \\times 1/c\\), so there is no \\(ab\\) term without \\(c\\), hence the coefficient is 0. So, that makes sense. So, in our original problem, since there is a constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the coefficient is non-zero.\n\nWait, so in our original problem, we have a constant term, so the coefficient is 120. That seems correct. So, I think I've got it right.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break down the problem into two parts using the binomial theorem.\n\n1. **Expanding \\((a + b)^4\\):**\n   Using the binomial theorem, we have:\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\), so the coefficient is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\n   \\]\n\n2. **Expanding \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   Using the binomial theorem, we have:\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n   \\]\n   We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, which occurs when \\(6 - 2k = 0\\).

The binomial theorem states that \\((x + y)^n = \\sum_{k=0}^{n} \\dbinom{n}{k} x^{n - k} y^k\\). In this case, \\(x = c\\), \\(y = \\dfrac{1}{c}\\), and \\(n = 6\\). So, each term in the expansion will be \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k\\). Let me simplify that term. \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\cdot \\dfrac{1}{c^k} = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k - k} = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). I need to find the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0 because that's the constant term. So, set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20.

Since these two terms are multiplied together in the product, the overall coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Wait, but let me double-check that. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\) with coefficient 6, and the term \\(c^0\\) comes from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) with coefficient 20.

Let me just make sure I didn't miss anything. Another way to think about it is that when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is multiplied by every term in the second part. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), we can ignore all terms in the second polynomial except the constant term. Because any term with \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\) would introduce a \\(c\\) term into the product, making it not just \\(a^2b^2\\). So, only the constant term in the second polynomial contributes to the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the product. Therefore, the coefficient is indeed 6 * 20 = 120. I think that makes sense. Let me just recap to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. First, I expanded \\((a + b)^4\\) and found the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. Then, I considered \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) and found the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Multiplying these together gives 120.

The binomial coefficients are straightforward, and the exponents worked out as needed. So, I feel confident that the answer is 120.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we proceed as follows:\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term with \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\):\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\n   \\]\n   So, the coefficient is 6.\n\n2. **Find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n   \\]\n   The constant term occurs when \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\):\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{6}{3} c^{0} = 20\n   \\]\n   So, the coefficient is 20.\n\n3. **Multiply the coefficients from both parts:**\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 20 = 120\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

The binomial expansion is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k\\). Let me simplify that general term.

So, multiplying them together: \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is 120. Wait, let me just double-check to make sure I didn't make a mistake. First, in the binomial expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed at \\(k = 2\\), and \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\), that's correct. Then, for \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term where the exponent is 0 occurs at \\(k = 3\\), and \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\), that's also correct. Multiplying 6 and 20 gives 120, so that seems right. I don't think I missed anything here. The key was realizing that when multiplying the two expansions, the only way to get a term without \\(c\\) is to multiply by the constant term from the second polynomial, which is 20. So, yeah, the final coefficient is 120.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break down the problem into two parts:\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\):\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} a^{2}b^{2} = 6a^2b^2\n   \\]\n   So, the coefficient is 6.\n\n2. **Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n   \\]\n   We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0:\n   \\[\n   6 - 2k = 0 \\implies k = 3\n   \\]\n   The coefficient is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\n   \\]\n\n3. **Multiply the coefficients from both expansions:**\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 20 = 120\n   \\]\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\\[\n\\boxed{120}\n\\]"

So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Now, going back to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the other polynomial is 20. So, when we multiply these two polynomials together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will come from multiplying \\(a^2b^2\\) by \\(c^0\\), which is just 1. Therefore, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Wait, let me double-check that. So, the coefficient from the first part is 6, and the coefficient from the second part is 20. Multiplying them together gives 120. Hmm, that seems right. But just to make sure I didn't make a mistake, let me recap: The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\) with coefficient 6. The term \\(c^0\\) comes from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) with coefficient 20. So, when you multiply these two terms, you get \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\) as the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\). I don't think I missed anything here. Wait, but let me think again. Is there a possibility that when multiplying the two polynomials, other terms could contribute to \\(a^2b^2\\)? For example, could a term from \\((a + b)^4\\) with \\(a^k b^{4 - k}\\) multiply a term from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) such that the product ends up as \\(a^2b^2\\) times some \\(c\\) term? But no, because \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\). So, the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is to multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first polynomial by the \\(c^0\\) term from the second polynomial. Any other combination would result in a term that includes \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), which isn't part of \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the only contribution is from those two specific terms. So, the coefficient is indeed 6 times 20, which is 120. Wait, another way to think about it is to consider the entire expansion. When you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the sum over all possible products where the product includes \\(a^2b^2\\) and any term from the second polynomial. But since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the only term that contributes is when you take \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part and \\(c^0\\) from the second part. So, the coefficient is 6 times 20, which is 120. I think that's correct. Let me just check if there's another approach. Alternatively, maybe I can consider the entire expression and see if there's a way to combine the coefficients. But I think the method I used is solid. So, to recap:\n\n1. Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) and find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is 6.\n2. Expand \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) and find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\), which is 20.\n3. Multiply these two coefficients together because when you multiply the two polynomials, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first and the \\(c^0\\) term from the second will combine to give the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the product.\n4. So, 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, maybe I can compute the entire expansion or at least verify the steps again.\n\nFirst, \\((a + b)^4\\):\n\n- The expansion is \\(a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6.\n\nSecond, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\):\n\n- The expansion is \\(c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15c^{-2} + 6c^{-4} + c^{-6}\\). So, the constant term is 20. That's correct.\n\nNow, when you multiply these two expansions, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will only come from multiplying the \\(a^2b^2\\) term (which is 6a^2b^2) by the constant term 20. So, 6a^2b^2 * 20 = 120a^2b^2. Therefore, the coefficient is 120. Yep, that seems right.\n\nI don't think I made any mistakes here. So, I'm confident that the coefficient is 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break down the problem into two parts:\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\):\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\n   \\]\n   So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\n2. **Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n   \\]\n   We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0:\n   \\[\n   6 - 2m = 0 \\implies m = 3\n   \\]\n   The coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\n   \\]\n\n3. **Multiply the coefficients from both parts:**\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20.

    "text": " So, first, let me handle the second part: the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Again, I can use the binomial theorem for this. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying each term, that becomes \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m}\\) which is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, each term has an exponent of \\(6 - 2m\\). I need the term where the exponent is 0, so I set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), I get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Now, going back to the original problem, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from multiplying the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first part by the \\(c^0\\) term in the second part. Therefore, the coefficient is the product of the two coefficients I found: 6 and 20. So, 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120. Let me double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake. First, I expanded \\((a + b)^4\\) and found the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) correctly as 6. Then, I considered the second part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), and used the binomial theorem to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\), which is 20. Then, I multiplied them together because the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by the constant term from the second polynomial. That makes sense because any other term from the second polynomial would introduce a \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), which would make the product have a term involving \\(c\\), which we don't want. So, I think my steps are correct. Therefore, the coefficient should be 120.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not missing anything. Is there a possibility that other terms could contribute to \\(a^2b^2\\) without involving \\(c\\)? For example, could there be a term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) that is a constant and another term that somehow combines with \\(a^2b^2\\) to give \\(a^2b^2\\) without involving \\(c\\)? Wait, no, because the second polynomial only involves \\(c\\), so when you multiply it by the first polynomial, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. But since the second polynomial's terms have \\(c\\) raised to some power, unless that power is zero, the product will have a \\(c\\) term. Therefore, the only way to get a term that's purely \\(a^2b^2\\) is to multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by the constant term in the second polynomial. So, that's correct. So, the coefficient is indeed 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of it as the entire expression being the product of two polynomials, and the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the product of the coefficients of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial and the constant term in the second polynomial. So, yes, that's consistent with what I did earlier.\n\nI don't think I made any calculation mistakes. Let me check the binomial coefficients again. For \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\), which is 6. Correct. For \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\), which is 20. Correct. So, 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient is 120.\n\nI think that's the correct answer.

So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is 120. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake here. Let me double-check each step. First, expanding \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). That seems correct. Then, for \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the expansion is correct, and the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0 is when \\(m = 3\\), which gives \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying 6 and 20 gives 120. Hmm, that seems right. So, I think I did this correctly. Therefore, the coefficient is 120.\n\nWait a second, but let me think again. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but in the entire expression, \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, when you expand the entire expression, each term from \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term from the other expansion, including the \\(c^0\\) term. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, but wait, no. Actually, in the entire product, each term will be of the form \\(a^kb^l c^m\\), so if we're looking for \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\), but in the problem statement, it's just \\(a^2b^2\\), which implies that the \\(c\\) part must be \\(c^0\\), because otherwise, the term would have \\(c\\) raised to some power, making it \\(a^2b^2c^m\\). So, the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would correspond to the term where the \\(c\\) exponent is 0, so the \\(c^0\\) term. Therefore, the coefficient is indeed 6 * 20 = 120. So, I think that's correct.\n\nWait, but another way to think about it is that when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each polynomial. But in this case, since the second polynomial is in \\(c\\), and the first is in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), the only way to get a term without \\(c\\) is to multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term by the \\(c^0\\) term. So, yes, that's exactly what we did. So, the coefficient is 120. Okay, I think that's solid. Let me just write down the steps again to make sure I didn't miss anything.\n\n1. Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\):\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\n   \\]\n2. Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\):\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\n   \\]\n3. Multiply the two coefficients together:\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 20 = 120\n   \\]\nSo, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is 120.\n\nWait, but I just thought of something else. Let me check if the problem is correctly interpreted. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), so the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be part of the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\), and then multiplied by each term from the other expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Wait, no, that's not right. Because when you multiply two polynomials, each term from the first is multiplied by each term from the second. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial times the entire second polynomial, but that's not correct either because the second polynomial is in terms of \\(c\\). Wait, no, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Wait, no, that's not right because the second polynomial is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is a Laurent polynomial in \\(c\\). So, when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Wait, no, that's not correct because the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) would be obtained by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\(2^6 = 64\\). But that's not what we need here. We need only the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0 because we want the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 20 = 120. So, I think I was correct the first time. Let me just confirm this by considering a smaller example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^1 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, expanding this, we get \\(ac + a/c + bc + b/c\\). Now, if I look for the coefficient of \\(a^1b^0c^0\\), which would be the term \\(a \\times b\\) times \\(c^0\\), but wait, in this case, the term would be \\(a \\times (c + 1/c)\\) plus \\(b \\times (c + 1/c)\\), so the terms are \\(ac + a/c + bc + b/c\\). There is no \\(a^1b^0c^0\\) term because all terms have either \\(a\\) or \\(b\\) multiplied by \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^1b^0c^0\\) is 0. Wait, but if I were to look for the coefficient of \\(a^1b^0\\), regardless of \\(c\\), then it would be the sum of coefficients of \\(a^1b^0c^m\\) for all \\(m\\). But in our original problem, we're looking for \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), which would require the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). So, in the smaller example, the coefficient of \\(a^1b^0c^0\\) is 0 because there's no such term. But in our problem, we have \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), and we're looking for \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). So, the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120. So, that seems correct. Therefore, I think my initial approach was correct, and the answer is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by considering the contributions from each part of the product.\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\)**: Using the binomial theorem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n\n2. **Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)**: The term with \\(c^0\\) occurs when \\(m = 3\\), giving a coefficient of \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n\n3. **Multiply the coefficients**: \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

Simplifying that, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\cdot c^{-m} = \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the exponent of \\(c\\) in each term is \\(6 - 2m\\). I need the term where the exponent is 0, so I set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), I get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). So, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\).

Now, going back to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the other part is 20. So, when I multiply these two parts together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by 20, because the \\(c^0\\) term is 20. So, the overall coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Wait, but let me make sure I didn't miss anything. The problem is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), so when I expand this, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by every term in the second part. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), we need to find the term in the second expansion that is \\(c^0\\), because any other term would introduce a \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), making the product have terms like \\(a^2b^2c\\) or \\(a^2b^2/c\\), which aren't just \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, only the term where the second expansion is \\(c^0\\) will contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product. So, that means the coefficient is indeed 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the second part), giving 120. Let me just verify that again. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 20. Multiplying them together gives 6 * 20 = 120.
