    "text": " So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Let me compute that: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient from the first part is 6. Now, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but the second part doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), it's in terms of \\(c\\). So, does that mean that when I multiply these two expressions together, the coefficients from the first part will just be multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part? Hmm, but the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which comes from the first part. So, does that mean that the coefficient from the first part is independent of the second part? Let me think. If I have \\((a + b)^4\\) times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), then when I expand it, each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is 6, and we don't care about the \\(c\\) terms, maybe the coefficient remains 6? Wait, that doesn't seem right. Let me think again. Because the entire expression is a product of two expansions, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second. But the \\(a^2b^2\\) term is only present in the first part, so when multiplied by the second part, it would be \\(6 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that would mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would actually be \\(6 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that's not a constant; it's a polynomial in \\(c\\). Hmm, so perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). Or maybe it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by some term in \\(c\\). Wait, but the problem statement is: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, perhaps they are considering the entire expression as a product, and they want the coefficient of the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any term from the second expansion. So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems odd because then the coefficient would be a polynomial, not a single number. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times a specific term in \\(c\\), but the problem doesn't specify which term. Wait, perhaps I misread the problem. Let me check again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" Hmm, it's a bit ambiguous. If the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that's not a single coefficient. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some specific \\(k\\), but since it's not specified, I think perhaps I need to consider that the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, meaning that the coefficient would be 6 times the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems complicated. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable, so the coefficient would indeed be 6 times the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make much sense because the question is asking for a single coefficient. Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try another approach. Maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the constant term with respect to \\(c\\). So, perhaps I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). That would make sense. So, first, find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), then multiply them together. Let me try that. So, first part: coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. Second part: find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). To find the constant term, I can use the binomial theorem again. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). The constant term occurs when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, so set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(k = 3\\). So, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 times 20, which is 120. So, the final answer is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplying it by the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20. Thus, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\boxed{120}"

    "text": " So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Let me calculate that. \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) is 6, because \\(4! / (2! * (4-2)!) = (24)/(2 * 2) = 24/4 = 6\\). So, the coefficient from the first part is 6. Now, the expression also has a second part: \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I notice that this part involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), but the term we're looking for is \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\). So, does this mean that the coefficient from the second part doesn't affect the \\(a^2b^2\\) term? Wait, that can't be right. Because the entire expression is the product of \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), so when we multiply them together, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), we need to find the term in the second expansion that is a constant (i.e., \\(c^0\\)), because any other term would introduce a \\(c\\) power which would make the term have \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), which isn't part of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Let me think about how to do that. Again, using the binomial theorem, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(1/c\\right)^m\\). Simplifying that, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m} = \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We want the exponent of \\(c\\) to be zero because that's the constant term. So, set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which gives \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20. Now, since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which comes from the first part, and the constant term from the second part, we multiply these two coefficients together. So, 6 (from the first expansion) multiplied by 20 (from the second expansion) gives 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120. Wait, let me double-check that I didn't make a mistake. So, in the first expansion, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, and in the second expansion, the constant term is 20. When we multiply these two parts together, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part is multiplied by the constant term from the second part, which gives 6 * 20 = 120. So, yes, that seems correct. I don't think I made a mistake here. Another way to think about it is that since the second part doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms, it's just a scalar multiple, so it scales the coefficients of the first expansion by 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) becomes 6 * 20 = 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is found by expanding each part separately and then multiplying the relevant coefficients. From \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. From \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the constant term (which doesn't affect \\(a\\) and \\(b\\)) is 20. Multiplying these gives 6 * 20 = 120.\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\boxed{120}."

So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. \n\nNow, the expression we have is \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I need to consider the entire expression, not just \\((a + b)^4\\). Wait, but the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which only involves \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). The other part of the expression, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). Since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), does that mean the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just 6 multiplied by whatever the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is? Wait, no, that can't be right because the entire expression is a product of two expansions. So, maybe I need to consider the entire expansion of both parts and find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. But actually, since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are different variables, the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are independent of those involving \\(c\\). So, when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that doesn't make sense because when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficients multiply term by term. But in this case, since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are only in the first part, and \\(c\\) is only in the second part, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all terms in the second part. But that would mean the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that can't be correct because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\). So, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Wait, perhaps the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), and we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, that is, in the product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) can be multiplied by any power of \\(c\\), but we just need the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) irrespective of \\(c\\)'s exponent. So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that would make the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) equal to 6 multiplied by the sum of the coefficients of all terms in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems too large. Let me think again. Alternatively, maybe I'm supposed to consider that the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by every term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is 6 times the sum of the coefficients of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Maybe the question is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that seems incorrect because the coefficient should be a single number, not a polynomial. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\). That would make more sense, because then we're considering the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\). So, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product. If that's the case, then we need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), and then multiply them together. That makes more sense. So, let's proceed under that assumption. So, first, as before, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. Now, we need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). To do this, let's expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem. The expansion is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be 0, so we set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Now, since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), we multiply the coefficients from each part: 6 (from \\(a^2b^2\\)) multiplied by 20 (from \\(c^0\\)) gives 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120. Wait, but let me double-check this. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in assuming that the problem wants the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). Maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). If that's the case, then the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But that doesn't make sense because the coefficient should be a single number, not a polynomial. So, I think the correct interpretation is that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which would involve considering all possible powers of \\(c\\), but that would mean the coefficient is a sum over all terms, which again doesn't make sense because the coefficient should be a single number. So, I think the correct approach is that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then finding the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20.

    "text": " So, the coefficient here would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\), which is 6. So, the term is \\(6a^2b^2\\). Okay, so that's the first part. Now, the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I need to consider how this multiplication affects the term \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, actually, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is just from the first part, and the second part is another binomial expression. So, when we multiply these two expressions together, each term from \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).

Alternatively, maybe it's considering that \\(a^2b^2\\) is part of the product, and the rest of the terms involve \\(c\\), so the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of the second part, but that seems odd because the coefficient is a number, not an expression. Wait, perhaps the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, which would be the coefficient from the first part times the entire expansion of the second part, but that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. Hmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and the second part doesn't affect it because it's multiplied by terms involving \\(c\\). But that seems too simple. Wait, no, that can't be right because when you multiply two expressions, each term from the first is multiplied by each term from the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part would be multiplied by each term from the second part, which includes various powers of \\(c\\).

So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).

Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 * 64 = 384. Wait, that seems plausible. Let me check that again. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6. The second part, when expanded, has various terms, each with their own coefficients. When we multiply the two expressions, each term from the first is multiplied by each term from the second.

So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second part. The sum of the coefficients in the second part is indeed 2^6 = 64, so 6 * 64 = 384.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where \\(a\\) is squared, \\(b\\) is squared, and \\(c\\) is to the zero power. In that case, we would need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part, which is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\) because in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term where \\(c\\) cancels out is when we have 3 \\(c\\)s and 3 \\(1/c\\)s, so the exponent is \\(6 - 2*3 = 0\\). So, the coefficient would be \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) would be 6 * 20 = 120. But the problem didn't specify \\(c^0\\), it just said \\(a^2b^2\\). So, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), which would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which is 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, if it's asking for \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), it's 120. Hmm, I'm a bit confused now. Let me read the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)\". So, it's just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), without specifying anything about \\(c\\). So, in the product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by each term from the second part, which includes different powers of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Because each term in the second part has a coefficient, and when you multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), each of those coefficients becomes part of the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) where \\(k\\) is the exponent from the second part. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the sum of all coefficients from the second part multiplied by 6. The sum of the coefficients in the second part is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\(\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384. So, I think that's the answer.\n\nWait, but to double-check, let's consider that when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum of the products of the coefficients of terms whose variables add up to that term. In this case, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial comes from the first part, and it's multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Because each term in the second part is a coefficient times some power of \\(c\\), and when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), it becomes \\(a^2b^2\\) times that coefficient times \\(c^k\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second part, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem had specified a specific power of \\(c\\), like \\(c^0\\), then we would have to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would involve finding the specific term in the second part where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out, giving \\(c^0\\). That would be the middle term, which is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\), so the coefficient would be 6 * 20 = 120. But since the problem didn't specify \\(c^0\\), I think it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), which is 384.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. Another way to think about it is that when you have two separate variables, \\(a, b\\) and \\(c\\), the terms in the product will be of the form \\(a^kb^l c^m\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the sum of all coefficients where \\(k=2\\), \\(l=2\\), and \\(m\\) can be anything. But in reality, in the product, the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) come only from the first part, and the exponents of \\(c\\) come only from the second part. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is actually \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by each term from the second part. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is indeed the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the sum of all coefficients in the second part. So, that would be 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me think differently. Suppose I expand both parts separately and then multiply them. The first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), has terms up to \\(a^4b^0\\) and down to \\(a^0b^4\\). The second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), has terms from \\(c^6\\) down to \\(c^{-6}\\). When I multiply these together, each term from the first part is multiplied by each term from the second part. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part would be multiplied by each term in the second part, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), etc. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient from the first part, 6, multiplied by the sum of all coefficients from the second part, which is 64, giving 384. So, I think that's correct.\n\nWait, but another way to see it is that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the entire second part, because when you multiply by the second part, you're effectively scaling the first part by each term in the second part. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second part, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nI think that makes sense. So, the coefficient is 384.\n\nWait, but just to be thorough, let me calculate the sum of the coefficients in the second part again. The second part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The sum of the coefficients is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), so \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, yes, that's correct.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nI think that's the answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{384}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem.\n\nFirst, consider the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n\\]\nWe need the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2. This corresponds to \\(k = 2\\), giving the term:\n\\[\n\\dbinom{4}{2} a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\n\\]\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\nNext, consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The sum of the coefficients in this expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\):\n\\[\n\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\n\\]\n\nWhen multiplying the two expansions together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by each term from the second part. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the coefficient from the first part (6) multiplied by the sum of the coefficients from the second part (64):\n\\[\n6 \\times 64 = 384\n\\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\boxed{384}\\)."

    "text": " So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Let me calculate that: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient is 6. But wait, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I think I need to consider the expansion of both parts and then multiply them together, but maybe the terms involving \\(c\\) don't affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Let me think. Since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), when I multiply the two expansions, the coefficients from each part will multiply. But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, perhaps I just need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and then multiply it by the sum of all the coefficients in the second part \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that doesn't seem right. Wait, no, actually, I think I'm overcomplicating it. Since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, which is the product of two parts, each term in the product will be a term from the first expansion multiplied by a term from the second expansion. But the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would only come from the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2, regardless of the exponents of \\(c\\). So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients in the second part \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because each term in the second part will contribute a coefficient that, when multiplied by 6, will give the total coefficient for \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) where \\(k\\) can be any integer. But wait, that might not be the case. Let me think again. Maybe I should consider that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the product of the coefficients of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and the constant term (i.e., the coefficient of \\(c^0\\)) in the second part. Because if I take \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part and multiply it by \\(c^k\\) from the second part, the only way to get a term that is just \\(a^2b^2\\) is if \\(k = 0\\). But wait, the problem doesn't specify any exponent for \\(c\\); it just asks for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, perhaps the problem is considering all possible exponents of \\(c\\), meaning that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients from the second part. Because when you expand the entire expression, every term will be a product of a term from the first expansion and a term from the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Because for each term in the first part, you multiply it by every term in the second part, so the total coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) times any power of \\(c\\) would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second part. But wait, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some \\(k\\). So, perhaps I need to clarify: when they say the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), do they mean the coefficient regardless of the power of \\(c\\), or just the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\)? Hmm, that's a bit ambiguous. Let me check the problem statement again. It says: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, it's in the entire expression, which includes both \\(a, b\\) and \\(c, 1/c\\). So, perhaps the term \\(a^2b^2\\) can be multiplied by any power of \\(c\\), so the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Alternatively, maybe they want the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the constant term with respect to \\(c\\). Hmm, I'm a bit confused. Let me think about it. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by each term from the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. Because each term in the second expansion is a coefficient times some power of \\(c\\), so when you multiply by 6, you get 6 times the sum of coefficients. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 multiplied by the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Now, how do I find the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)? The sum of the coefficients in a polynomial is found by setting all variables to 1. So, if I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = (2)^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of the coefficients in the second part is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 * 64 = 384. Wait, but let me make sure. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), so it's 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which is 64, so 6*64=384. But let me check another way. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\). In that case, I would need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product. That would be the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part. So, in the first part, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. In the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is the middle term, which is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 * 20 = 120. Hmm, so now I'm confused because depending on interpretation, the answer could be 384 or 120. Let me read the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, it's in the entire expression. So, when they say \"coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", they probably mean the coefficient of the term \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, that would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which is 64, giving 384. But I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, maybe they mean the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be 120. Let me see if there's a way to clarify. If I consider the expression as a product of two polynomials, one in \\(a, b\\) and one in \\(c\\), then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the sum over all terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any power of \\(c\\). So, that would be 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which is 64, so 384. Alternatively, if they want the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), it's 120. But the problem statement isn't entirely clear. Wait, let me think about how the problem is phrased. It says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)\". So, in the entire expression, which is a product of two expressions, one in \\(a, b\\) and one in \\(c\\). So, in the product, each term is of the form \\(a^kb^{4 - k}c^mc^{n}\\), but actually, more precisely, each term is \\(a^kb^{4 - k} \\times c^m\\) or \\(a^kb^{4 - k} \\times c^{-m}\\), depending on the expansion. So, when they ask for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), they might be considering all possible exponents of \\(c\\), so the coefficient would be the sum of all coefficients where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any power of \\(c\\). So, that would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which is 64, so 384. But I'm still a bit unsure because sometimes when people ask for the coefficient of a term in a product, they might be referring to the coefficient when considering all variables. Wait, but in this case, the variables are separate, so \\(a, b\\) and \\(c\\) are independent variables. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) can be paired with any power of \\(c\\), so the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second part. So, 6*64=384. But let me check by expanding both parts and multiplying. Alternatively, maybe I can think of it as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6, and the coefficient of any term in the second part is multiplied by that 6. So, the total coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) times any power of \\(c\\) would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second part, which is 64, so 384. Alternatively, if they wanted the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), it would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part, which is 20, so 120. Hmm, I think I need to decide which interpretation is correct. Let me think about how the problem is presented. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. So, in the entire product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by each term from the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part. So, that would be 6*64=384. Alternatively, if they wanted the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), they would have specified that, perhaps as \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) or just \\(a^2b^2\\) with an implied \\(c^0\\). So, perhaps the answer is 384. But I'm still a bit unsure because sometimes when variables are separate, people might consider coefficients term by term. Let me try another approach. Let's consider that the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when we expand this, each term will be of the form \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}a^{4 - k}b^k \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - m}c^{-m}\\) or something like that. Wait, actually, the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, each term in the second expansion is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, when we multiply the two expansions, each term will be \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}a^{4 - k}b^k \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would come from the terms where \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\), so that's fixed as \\(k = 2\\), and then for each \\(m\\), the term is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\dbinom{6}{m}a^2b^2c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^{6 - 2m}\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\dbinom{6}{m}\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, that would mean summing over all possible \\(m\\), because each \\(m\\) gives a different power of \\(c\\), but the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) across all those terms would be the sum of \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\dbinom{6}{m}\\) for \\(m = 0\\) to \\(6\\). But \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) is 6, so the total coefficient would be 6 times the sum of \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\) from \\(m = 0\\) to \\(6\\). The sum of \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\) from \\(m = 0\\) to \\(6\\) is \\(2^6 = 64\\), so 6*64=384. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 384.\n\nWait, but let me confirm. Alternatively, if the problem had asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), that would be different. It would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion. The coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\), so 6*20=120. But since the problem just says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", without specifying \\(c\\), I think it's asking for the coefficient regardless of the power of \\(c\\), which would be 384.\n\nWait, but another way to think about it is that when you have multiple variables, the coefficient of a specific combination of variables is the product of the coefficients from each part. But in this case, since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the sum of coefficients from the second part. So, 6 * 64=384.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting me to consider that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just 6, because the other part doesn't affect it, but that doesn't make sense because the entire expression is a product, so the coefficients do multiply. Wait, no, that's not correct because each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, so the coefficients do combine. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, so 384.\n\nWait, but let me check with an example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^1 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). So, expanding that, it's \\((a + b)(c + 1/c)\\). The coefficient of \\(a^1b^0\\) would be 1 times the sum of coefficients in the second part, which is 2, so 2. But if I look at the product, it's \\(ac + a/c + bc + b/c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a\\) is 1 for \\(ac\\) and 1 for \\(a/c\\), so total coefficient of \\(a\\) is 2, which matches 1*2=2. Similarly, the coefficient of \\(b\\) is 2. So, in this case, the coefficient of \\(a\\) is the coefficient from the first part times the sum of coefficients from the second part. So, applying that logic, in the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 * 64=384.\n\nTherefore, I think the correct answer is 384.\n\nWait, but I'm still a bit confused because sometimes when you have separate variables, the coefficients are treated independently, but in this case, since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, which includes both \\(a, b\\) and \\(c\\), I think the correct approach is to consider that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second part, giving 384.\n\nSo, to summarize:\n\n1. Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is 6.\n\n2. The second part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), when expanded, has terms with various powers of \\(c\\).\n\n3. The sum of all coefficients in the second part is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\(2^6 = 64\\).\n\n4. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\nI think that's the correct approach. So, the final answer is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Next, the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is calculated by setting \\(c = 1\\), yielding \\(2^6 = 64\\). Multiplying these results gives \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n\\boxed{384}"

So, the coefficient from the first part is 6. Now, the second part of the expression is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Hmm, I need to figure out what the coefficient is for this part, but wait, I'm supposed to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\). So, maybe the second part doesn't affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)? Wait, that doesn't make sense because the entire expression is the product of both parts.

But then, since \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) are separate, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would multiply every term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually be a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient, so maybe it's expecting a numerical coefficient, treating \\(c\\) as another variable. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only considering terms where the powers of \\(c\\) cancel out, i.e., the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but the problem didn't specify anything about \\(c\\), so maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think again. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When we expand this, each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by every term in the second part. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product will be \\(6 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems odd because the coefficient would then be a polynomial in \\(c\\), not a single number. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out to zero. That would make sense because otherwise, the coefficient isn't a single number but a function of \\(c\\). So, maybe I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\) in the product. So, that would involve two steps: first, find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), and then multiply those two coefficients together. That seems plausible. So, let's proceed with that approach. First, as before, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. Now, let's find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). To do this, I'll use the binomial theorem again. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k\\). Simplifying each term, that becomes \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} c^{-k} = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, so we set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Now, since the original expression is the product of \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second part. But we're only interested in the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, which we found to have a coefficient of 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, considering only the constant term in \\(c\\), is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Wait, but let me double-check that. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part has coefficient 6, and the term \\(c^0\\) in the second part has coefficient 20. When you multiply these two parts together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is indeed 6 * 20 = 120. So, that should be the answer. Alternatively, if the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without considering \\(c\\), then the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which would make the coefficient a polynomial in \\(c\\). But since the problem is asking for the coefficient, and not specifying anything about \\(c\\), I think the more reasonable interpretation is that they want the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times the constant term in \\(c\\), which is 120. So, I think the answer is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Multiplying these together gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\boxed{120}"

So, the coefficient is 6. \n\nNow, the expression also has another part, which is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I'm not sure if this part affects the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) because \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\). Wait, but maybe I'm supposed to multiply the entire expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But if that's the case, then when I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I might just be considering the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by some term from the second expansion. But wait, actually, if I'm only asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), perhaps the other variables \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) don't affect it because they're separate. Let me think about this again. So, when I multiply two expressions together, each term in the first expression is multiplied by each term in the second.

Wait, but actually, the second part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which expands to terms involving \\(c^6, c^4, c^2, 1, c^{-2}, c^{-4}, c^{-6}\\). So, each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each of these terms. But since I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), that would mean I need to find the term in the second expansion that is \\(c^0\\), i.e., the constant term. Because only then, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), it would result in a term that is just \\(a^2b^2\\) times a constant. So, I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).

So, the general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). I need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero because that's the constant term. So, set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} c^{0} = \\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20. \n\nTherefore, when I multiply the two expansions together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by 20 from the second part.

So, the coefficient from the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), is 6. Now, the second part of the expression is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I notice that this part doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), so when I multiply the two parts together, the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) will come from the first expansion, and the terms involving \\(c\\) will come from the second expansion. But since we're only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I think that term would just be multiplied by whatever constant factor comes from the second expansion. Wait, but actually, when you multiply two expressions together, each term from the first expression is multiplied by each term from the second expression.

Wait, no, that doesn't make sense. Let me think again. When you have \\((a + b)^4\\) times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in the expansion will be of the form \\(a^kb^{4 - k}\\) times \\(c^m (1/c)^{6 - m}\\), which simplifies to \\(a^kb^{4 - k}c^{m - (6 - m)} = a^kb^{4 - k}c^{2m - 6}\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), that means the exponent of \\(c\\) must be zero. So, \\(2m - 6 = 0\\), which gives \\(m = 3\\). So, the term from the second expansion that contributes to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is when \\(m = 3\\). Let me compute that. The general term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{m} \\left(1/c\\right)^{6 - m} = \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{m - (6 - m)} = \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{2m - 6}\\).

Now, since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which comes from the first expansion with coefficient 6, and from the second expansion, the term that contributes is 20. So, when we multiply these two together, the total coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake here. So, the first part's coefficient is 6, and the second part's relevant term is 20. Multiplying them together gives 120. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120. Let me just double-check my steps. First, I found the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) correctly as 6.

The coefficient for that term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Then, since the two parts are multiplied together, the coefficients multiply as well, so 6 * 20 = 120. That seems right.

The problem says: What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\).

So, in other words, when you multiply out the entire expression, how many times does \\(a^2b^2\\) appear, and what is the coefficient? But since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be the coefficient from the first part, multiplied by the entire second expansion. But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the question is asking for a numerical coefficient. Wait, maybe I'm misinterpreting the question. Perhaps it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times some power of \\(c\\), but without specifying the power of \\(c\\), it's unclear. Alternatively, maybe the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable, but that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\). Hmm, but that seems odd. Let me think again. Wait, perhaps the problem is only considering the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a sum of terms involving \\(c\\), which is not a single number. Therefore, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) because that's the only way the coefficient would be a single number. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, considering all possible powers of \\(c\\), but that would mean the coefficient is a sum over all possible \\(c\\) terms, which is not a single number. Hmm, perhaps I should approach this differently. Let me try to expand both parts separately and see how they interact. First, let's expand \\((a + b)^4\\). As I did before, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) has a coefficient of 6. Now, let's expand \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem again, this is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(1/c\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, each term in this expansion is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\) for \\(k\\) from 0 to 6. Now, when we multiply the two expansions together, each term from the first expansion is multiplied by each term from the second expansion. So, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, resulting in terms like \\(6a^2b^2 \\times \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product will be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients from the second expansion. But wait, no, that's not correct because each term in the second expansion has a different power of \\(c\\), so when you multiply \\(6a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, you get terms with different powers of \\(c\\), but the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just 6 times the entire second expansion. But that can't be right because the coefficient should be a single number, not a polynomial. Therefore, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by some specific power of \\(c\\), but since the problem doesn't specify, I must have made a mistake in interpreting it. Alternatively, maybe the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable, so the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of the second part. But that seems unlikely because the problem is probably expecting a numerical answer. Wait, maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, regardless of the power of \\(c\\), so the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. Let me check: The sum of all coefficients in the second expansion \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\). So, \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the sum of all coefficients is 64. So, if I multiply 6 by 64, I get 384. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 384. But wait, let me make sure that's correct. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), meaning the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. Let me check that possibility. If that's the case, then I need to find the term in the second expansion where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. From the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the exponent of \\(c\\) is \\(6 - 2k\\), so setting that equal to zero: \\(6 - 2k = 0\\) implies \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the term where \\(k=3\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} c^{0} = 20\\). So, the coefficient for \\(c^0\\) is 20. Therefore, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion, which has a coefficient of 6, when multiplied by the \\(c^0\\) term from the second expansion, which has a coefficient of 20, gives a total coefficient of \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\) for the term \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). But the problem didn't specify \\(c^0\\), so perhaps it's just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), which would be 6 times the entire sum of coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, giving 384. But I'm not sure which interpretation is correct. Let me re-examine the problem statement: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" It doesn't specify any power of \\(c\\), so it's ambiguous. However, in typical problems like this, when multiple variables are involved, and you're asked for the coefficient of a term involving some variables, it's often implied that you're considering the term regardless of the other variables. So, in this case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the entire expansion of the second part, which is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, not a number. Therefore, perhaps the intended interpretation is that we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\). That would make the coefficient a single number, which is 120. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times some specific power of \\(c\\), but without that information, it's unclear. Given that the problem is presented as a single question, it's more likely that it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), which would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, giving 384. Alternatively, if it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), it's 120. To determine which is correct, let me consider the standard approach to such problems. Typically, when you're asked for the coefficient of a term in a product of expansions, and the term involves some variables but not others, you're supposed to treat the other variables as separate and find the coefficient in the combined expansion. However, in this case, since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the product of the coefficient from the first expansion and the entire second expansion. But that would result in a coefficient that's a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense for a numerical answer. Therefore, it's more likely that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where the exponents of \\(c\\) are zero. Therefore, I think the correct approach is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion. As calculated earlier, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 20, so 6 times 20 is 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is 120. Alternatively, if the problem is indeed asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), the answer would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, so 6*64=384. But since the problem didn't specify, I'm a bit confused. Let me check the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" It doesn't mention anything about \\(c\\), so perhaps it's considering all possible powers of \\(c\\), meaning that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the entire expansion of the second part, which would mean the coefficient is a polynomial. But that doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a coefficient, which is a number. Therefore, perhaps the intended interpretation is that we're to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. Alternatively, maybe the problem is a misstatement, and it's actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which would be 6*20=120. That seems more plausible. Therefore, I think the correct answer is 120.\n\nWait, but let me make sure. Let me go through it again step by step.\n\n1. Expand \\((a + b)^4\\). The term \\(a^2b^2\\) has a coefficient of \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n\n2. Expand \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem, the general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} (1/c)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\).\n\n3. The entire expression is the product of the two expansions. So, each term from the first expansion is multiplied by each term from the second expansion.\n\n4. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term from the second expansion, resulting in terms like \\(6a^2b^2 \\times \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\).\n\n5. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is \\(6 \\times \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\), which is 6 times the entire expansion of the second part. But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which isn't a single number.\n\n6. Since the problem is asking for a coefficient, which is typically a number, it's more likely that we're to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero.\n\n7. To find the term where \\(c^0\\), set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\).\n\n8. The coefficient for \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n\n9. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nYes, that makes sense. So, the coefficient is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6. Then, we find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20. Multiplying these together gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}."

So, the coefficient is 6. Now, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but the problem is only asking about the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Does that mean I don't need to consider the terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\)? Hmm, maybe not. Because \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term that comes only from the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\), and the other part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), when expanded, will give terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), but since we're multiplying the two expansions together, any term in the product will be a product of a term from \\((a + b)^4\\) and a term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would come from the part where we have \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by some term from the second expansion. However, since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), maybe the coefficient is just 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part? Wait, that doesn't seem right. Wait, no, actually, when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum of the products of the coefficients of terms that multiply together to give that specific term. But in this case, since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by each term from the second expansion, but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), that would require that the second factor contributes a term that is 1, right? Because \\(a^2b^2 \\times 1 = a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because \\(c^0 = 1\\), which would leave \\(a^2b^2\\) as is. So, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me calculate that. Using the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, we want the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, which means \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the second part), which is 6 * 20 = 120. Wait, but let me make sure I'm not missing anything. The original expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). When we multiply these two, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), that term must come from multiplying \\(a^2b^2\\) by the term in the second expansion that is \\(c^0\\), which is 1. So, the coefficient is indeed 6 * 20 = 120. Alternatively, if I consider that the entire expression is a product, then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the product of the coefficients from each part, since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\).

Since the expression is a product of two separate binomial expressions, the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are in one part, and the terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) are in the other.

But the question is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. Hmm, that might mean that the coefficient is just 6, because regardless of what the \\(c\\) terms are, when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by any term from the second expansion, you'll still have \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by some power of \\(c\\). But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), perhaps it's just 6, because each occurrence of \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by different \\(c\\) terms, but the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) itself would just be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in the second expansion. Wait, that doesn't make sense because the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion is \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\), so 6 times 64 is 384. But that seems too large. Maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, without considering the \\(c\\) terms. So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6, because the \\(c\\) terms don't affect the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. Wait, but that doesn't seem right either because when you multiply the two expansions, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), so the \\(a^2b^2\\) term would be multiplied by the entire second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 times 64, which is 384. But that seems high. Let me check again.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm supposed to consider only the constant term in the second expansion, meaning the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, because that's the only term that would leave \\(a^2b^2\\) as a standalone term without any \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\). So, maybe I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) and then multiply it by 6. Let me try that approach. So, first, find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(1/c\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). The constant term occurs when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(k = 3\\). So, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (the constant term from the second part), which is 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nWait, that makes sense. So, the idea is that in the product, each term from the first expansion is multiplied by each term from the second expansion. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), we need to find the term in the second expansion that doesn't involve \\(c\\) either, which is the constant term. Then, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the product of the coefficients from both expansions. So, 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nLet me verify this again. The first part gives us \\(a^2b^2\\) with a coefficient of 6. The second part, when expanded, has a constant term of 20. So, when we multiply these two, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term is multiplied by 20, giving a total coefficient of 6 * 20 = 120. That seems correct. So, I think the answer is 120.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in calculating the constant term in the second expansion. So, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\).

So, the term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} c^{0} = 20\\). That's correct. So, the constant term is indeed 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nI think that's the correct approach.

So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Wait, no. Because when you multiply two expressions, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum of the products of the coefficients of terms that multiply to give that specific term. But in this case, \\(a^2b^2\\) is only in the first part, so when you multiply by the second part, each term in the second part will have a coefficient, and the product will have terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) and \\(a^2b^2 \\times \\dfrac{1}{c^k}\\), each with their own coefficients. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would be the coefficient when the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2, regardless of the exponents of \\(c\\). Wait, but in the product, \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by each term from the second expansion, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would actually be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in the second expansion. Because each term in the second expansion is a coefficient times a power of \\(c\\), and when you multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), the coefficient becomes 6 times that coefficient. But wait, no, because the second expansion is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a sum of terms with coefficients, each multiplied by \\(c^k\\) or \\(c^{-k}\\). So, when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each of these terms, you get terms like \\(6a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(6a^2b^2 \\times \\dfrac{1}{c^k}\\), each with their own coefficients. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would only consider the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2, regardless of the exponents of \\(c\\). Wait, but in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion because each term in the second expansion is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the total coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), because that makes each term's coefficient equal to the coefficient itself. So, if I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of the coefficients is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times 64, which is 384. Wait, but that seems too high. Let me think again. Alternatively, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, meaning that we're considering all terms, and \\(a^2b^2\\) could be multiplied by any power of \\(c\\). But in that case, the coefficient would indeed be 6 times the sum of the coefficients of the second expansion, which is 6*64=384. But I'm not sure if that's what the problem is asking. Wait, let me read the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would include all terms where \\(a\\) is squared and \\(b\\) is squared, regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, yes, that would mean that each term in the second expansion contributes a coefficient, and when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), the total coefficient is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion. So, 6 * 64 = 384. But let me check if that's correct. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning that \\(c\\) cancels out, so the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. In that case, we need to find the term where the exponents of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) cancel each other out, i.e., \\(c^0\\). So, in the second expansion, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term with \\(c^0\\) is the middle term when the exponent is 6. Using the binomial theorem, the term with \\(c^0\\) is when the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, which occurs at \\(k = 3\\) because the general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, to get \\(c^0\\), we set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\). So, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, the term with \\(c^0\\) is 20. So, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it's 6 * 20 = 120. But wait, the problem just says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", without specifying \\(c\\). So, perhaps the answer is 384, as I thought earlier. But now I'm confused because depending on the interpretation, the answer could be different. Let me try to clarify. If the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. However, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\), then the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120. I think the problem is more likely asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), because otherwise, it's a bit unusual to ask for the coefficient of a term that's multiplied by various powers of \\(c\\). So, I think the intended answer is 120. Let me confirm this. So, in the first part, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. In the second part, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. So, when you multiply these two parts, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the answer is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplying it by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20. Therefore, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\boxed{120}"

    "text": " So, the coefficient would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. \n\nBut wait, the original expression isn't just \\((a + b)^4\\); it's multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Hmm, so I need to consider that as well. Since the two parts of the expression are multiplied together, the entire term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by every term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). However, the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and since \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) are separate variables from \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), the presence of \\(c\\) terms doesn't affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, actually, I think I don't need to worry about the \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) part when looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). The coefficient remains 6 regardless of the other terms because they involve different variables. \n\nWait, let me make sure I'm not missing something. The entire expression is a product of two binomials raised to powers. So, when you multiply them out, each term from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term from the second expansion. But since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are different variables, the product terms will involve combinations like \\(a^kb^l c^m\\) or similar. However, the problem specifically asks for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\) at all. That means we're looking for the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2 each, and the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0. Because if the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, that term is just 1, so it doesn't affect the variables \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). \n\nSo, in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term that has \\(c^0\\) is the constant term. Let me find that. Using the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). The coefficient for that term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). So, the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. \n\nNow, going back to the original expression, \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), when we multiply the two expansions together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), we only need to consider the constant term from the second expansion. That's because any term involving \\(c\\) would result in a term that includes \\(c\\), which isn't part of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nSo, that would be 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the second part). Calculating that, 6 times 20 is 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120. \n\nWait, let me double-check that. So, in the first part, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6. In the second part, the constant term is 20. When we multiply these two, 6 times 20 is 120. So, yes, that seems correct. \n\nAlternatively, I can think of it as the entire expression being a product of two independent expansions. Since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are different variables, their exponents don't interfere with each other. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Which again gives me 6 times 20, which is 120. \n\nI think that's solid. So, the final answer should be 120. \n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break down the problem into two parts using the binomial theorem.\n\nFirst, consider the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\). Using the binomial theorem, we have:\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n\\]\nWe need the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2. This corresponds to \\(k = 2\\), giving us:\n\\[\n\\dbinom{4}{2} a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\n\\]\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\nNext, consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem, we have:\n\\[\n\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n\\]\nWe need the constant term (where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0). This occurs when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), solving for \\(m\\) gives \\(m = 3\\). The coefficient for this term is:\n\\[\n\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\n\\]\n\nFinally, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficients from the two parts:\n\\[\n6 \\times 20 = 120\n\\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

But in this case, since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, perhaps the coefficient is just 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't seem right because the question is asking for a single coefficient, not an expression involving \\(c\\). Hmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem.\n\nWait, no, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product. That means I need to consider all the terms in the product where \\(a^2b^2\\) appears. Since \\((a + b)^4\\) contributes \\(6a^2b^2\\), and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) contributes a sum of terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), when I multiply them together, each term in the product will be of the form \\(6a^2b^2 \\times \\text{something with } c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would actually be \\(6 \\times \\left(\\text{sum of all coefficients in } \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\right)\\). But wait, that's not correct because when you multiply by \\(6a^2b^2\\), each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) will be multiplied by \\(6a^2b^2\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is \\(6 \\times\\) the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is \\(6 \\times\\) the sum of the coefficients of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is \\(6 \\times 2^6 = 6 \\times 64 = 384\\). Wait, but that doesn't seem right because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a specific term, not the sum of all coefficients.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again. The problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when you expand the product, each term will be a product of a term from \\((a + b)^4\\) and a term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is \\(6 \\times\\) the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is obtained by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). But I'm not sure if that's correct because the problem might be expecting a different approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, meaning that the \\(c\\) part doesn't affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient is simply 6, and the rest of the terms involving \\(c\\) are separate. But that seems unlikely because the entire expression is a product, so the coefficients would be multiplied.\n\nWait, no, actually, when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficients multiply term by term. So, if I have \\(6a^2b^2\\) multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), then each of those terms will have coefficients, and the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be \\(6\\) multiplied by each coefficient in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).

However, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a specific term, so perhaps it's just \\(6\\) times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because that's the only term that would result in \\(a^2b^2\\) when multiplied by \\(6a^2b^2\\). Wait, that makes more sense.\n\nSo, in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term with \\(c^0\\) is the constant term, which is the middle term when the exponent is even. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) can be found using the binomial theorem. The general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Therefore, when we multiply \\(6a^2b^2\\) by \\(20c^0\\), we get \\(120a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 120.\n\nWait, but let me double-check that. So, \\((a + b)^4\\) gives \\(6a^2b^2\\), and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) gives a term with \\(c^0\\) which is 20. So, multiplying these together, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). That seems correct. Alternatively, if I consider the entire product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will only come from the product of \\(6a^2b^2\\) and the constant term 20, so the coefficient is indeed 120.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.

Now, the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Hmm, so I need to consider how this affects the coefficient. Wait, but the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is only from the first part, right?

So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the sum of all those products. Wait, no, actually, I think I'm overcomplicating this. Since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), I think I need to consider that the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term without \\(c\\), its coefficient in the product would be the coefficient in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, that doesn't sound right. Let me think again.\n\nWait, no, actually, when you multiply two expressions, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each expression. But in this case, \\(a^2b^2\\) is in the first part, and the second part has terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, but since we're only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term without \\(c\\), that would require that the second part contributes a term with \\(c^0\\), because \\(a^2b^2 \\times c^0 = a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part. So, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nLet me compute that. So, expanding \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem, it's \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We want the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\).\n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficient from the first part and the coefficient from the second part, which is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nWait, let me check that again. So, in the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. In the second part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. When you multiply these two parts together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, but only the term with \\(c^0\\) will contribute to the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the product because any other term would have a \\(c\\) exponent, making the overall term have \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), which isn't just \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient is indeed 6 times 20, which is 120.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not missing anything. The problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. So, if I have \\((a + b)^4\\) times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), then each term in the expansion is of the form \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}a^{2}b^{2}\\) times \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}c^{0}\\), which is when \\(k=2\\) and \\(m=3\\). So, yes, the coefficient is 6 times 20, which is 120.\n\nI think that's correct. Let me just recap: The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 20, so when you multiply these two parts, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 * 20 = 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion is found by multiplying the coefficients from each part of the expression. \n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\):** The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n2. **Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):** The coefficient of \\(c^0\\) (the constant term) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n3. **Multiply the coefficients:** \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

So, the coefficient is 6 for \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\). \n\nNow, the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Hmm, so I need to consider how this multiplication affects the coefficient we just found. Wait, but the term \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), so when I multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), it will just add a coefficient from that expansion to the existing coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). But actually, no, wait. The entire product is \\((a + b)^4\\) times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by every term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which suggests that we're looking for the term where the variables are only \\(a^2b^2\\) and no \\(c\\) terms. Wait, that doesn't make sense because when you multiply by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), you'll end up with terms that have \\(c\\) raised to various powers. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which implies that the \\(c\\) terms should cancel out or be multiplied in such a way that we get a constant term. Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me check again. The problem says: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, perhaps they are treating \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) as separate variables, and they want the coefficient of the term where \\(a\\) is squared, \\(b\\) is squared, and \\(c\\) is raised to the zero power (i.e., \\(c^0 = 1\\)). So, in other words, we need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product. That makes sense because otherwise, if \\(c\\) is involved, the term would have \\(c\\) raised to some power, but the problem is only specifying \\(a^2b^2\\). So, we need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\).\n\nTherefore, let me approach this by considering the entire expansion. The product is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, each term in the expansion will be of the form \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}a^{4 - k}b^k \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - m}\\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying that, the term becomes \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}\\dbinom{6}{m}a^{4 - k}b^k c^{6 - 2m}\\). Now, we need to find the coefficient where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2, and the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0. So, we have \\(4 - k = 2\\) which gives \\(k = 2\\), and \\(k = 2\\) also because we need \\(b^2\\). So, that's consistent. Now, for the exponent of \\(c\\), we need \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which gives \\(6 = 2m\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the term we're interested in is when \\(k = 2\\) and \\(m = 3\\). So, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} \\times \\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Let me calculate that. \n\nFirst, \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) is 6, as I found earlier. Then, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\) is \\(\\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). So, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is 120. \n\nWait, but let me double-check to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. So, in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6. In the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term where \\(c^0\\) is the middle term when \\(m = 3\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, multiplying these together, 6 * 20 is 120. That seems correct. \n\nAlternatively, I can think of it as first expanding \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) separately, then looking for the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by the constant term in the second expansion. Since the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 20, as we found, then multiplying by 6 gives 120. Yeah, that makes sense. So, I think 120 is the correct coefficient.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is found by multiplying the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) (which is 6) by the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) (which is 20). Thus, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\boxed{120}"

So, I also have this second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Do I need to consider that as well? Hmm, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, does that mean I'm only concerned with the terms from the first part, and the second part can be treated separately? Because \\(c\\) and \\(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\) are separate variables from \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), right? So, when I multiply the two expressions together, the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) will be multiplied by terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\).

Because the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will be multiplied by every term in the second expansion, but since we're just looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), perhaps we can just take the coefficient from the first part and multiply it by the entire second part, treating it as a constant? Wait, no, that doesn't sound right. Because if we do that, we'd be changing the coefficient, but actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would just be the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the entire second part. Wait, but that would make the coefficient a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again. \n\nWait, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, which is the product of the two binomials. So, actually, when you expand the entire product, each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by every term in the second part. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. But that doesn't seem right because the coefficient would then be a sum involving terms with \\(c\\). Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some \\(k\\), but it's just written as \\(a^2b^2\\), so perhaps we can ignore the \\(c\\) terms and just take the coefficient from the first part? That seems possible, but I'm not sure. Let me check the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" Hmm, maybe the problem is written in a way that the \\(c\\) terms are just part of the expression, but we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't seem right because the coefficient is a single number, not a polynomial. Wait, perhaps I'm misinterpreting it. Maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating \\(c\\) as a variable, but the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would have a coefficient that's a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem just says \"the coefficient\", which is a bit ambiguous. Alternatively, maybe the problem is written as a product, and we're supposed to treat \\(c\\) as a separate variable, but the question is only about \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), so perhaps the coefficient is just 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. Wait, but that doesn't make sense because the coefficient would then be 6 times \\(2^6 = 64\\), which is 384. But I'm not sure if that's correct. Let me think again.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. The problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when you multiply two expressions, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each factor. But in this case, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the first factor, \\((a + b)^4\\), and it's multiplied by every term in the second factor, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first factor multiplied by the entire expansion of the second factor. But that would mean that the coefficient is a sum involving terms with \\(c\\), which seems odd because the problem is asking for a single coefficient. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning that we're looking for the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2 and 2, respectively, and the exponents of \\(c\\) sum to zero. Because in the second factor, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the exponents of \\(c\\) can range from -6 to +6 in steps of 2, I think. So, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would involve finding the term in the second expansion where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, and then multiplying that by the coefficient from the first part.\n\nWait, that makes more sense. So, the problem is likely asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is the same as \\(a^2b^2\\), because \\(c^0 = 1\\). So, I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part, then multiply them together. That would give me the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product, which is what the problem is asking for.\n\nSo, let's proceed with that approach. First, find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which we've already determined as 6.\n\nNext, find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). To do this, we can use the binomial theorem again. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k\\). Simplifying that, each term becomes \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be zero, so we set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the term where \\(k = 3\\) is the one with \\(c^0\\). The coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20.\n\nNow, to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product, we multiply the coefficients from each part: 6 (from \\(a^2b^2\\)) and 20 (from \\(c^0\\)). So, 6 times 20 is 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120.\n\nWait, but let me double-check that. So, \\((a + b)^4\\) gives \\(a^2b^2\\) with coefficient 6, and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) gives \\(c^0\\) with coefficient 20. When you multiply these two, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by 20, so the coefficient becomes 6 * 20 = 120. That seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, another way to think about it is that when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each polynomial. So, since \\(a^2b^2\\) is in the first polynomial and \\(c^0\\) is in the second, their product contributes to the term \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), and the coefficient is the product of the individual coefficients. So, yes, 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nI think that makes sense. So, the final answer should be 120.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me think if there's another way to approach this problem. Maybe by expanding both expressions and looking for the specific term. But that would be time-consuming, especially since the exponents are 4 and 6. Alternatively, perhaps I can think in terms of generating functions. The generating function for \\((a + b)^4\\) is straightforward, and the generating function for \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is also known. When you multiply them, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is indeed the product of the individual coefficients, as I calculated before.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can think of the entire expression as a product and see if there's a way to combine the terms, but I think the approach I took is the most straightforward.\n\nSo, to recap: The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 20. Multiplying these together gives 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120.\n\nI think that's correct. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning, so I'll go with that.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires finding the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\):\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\n   \\]\n\n2. **Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n   \\]\n   To find the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0:\n   \\[\n   6 - 2k = 0 \\implies k = 3\n   \\]\n   The coefficient is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\n   \\]\n\n3. **Multiply the coefficients from both expansions:**\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 20 = 120\n   \\]\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}."

Let me consider that \\((a + b)^4\\) is being multiplied by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the expansion would be \\(\\sum_{i=0}^4 \\dbinom{4}{i}a^{4-i}b^i \\times \\sum_{j=0}^6 \\dbinom{6}{j}c^{6 - j}(1/c)^j\\). Simplifying the second sum, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{j}c^{6 - 2j}\\). So, when we multiply the two sums together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the term where \\(i = 2\\) in the first sum, which is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\), multiplied by the entire second sum, because any term in the second sum multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\) would still be a term with \\(a^2b^2\\) and some power of \\(c\\). But the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), so we need to sum all the coefficients from the second expansion and multiply by 6. \n\nSo, the sum of coefficients in the second expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). \n\nWait, but let me think again. Is there another way to approach this? Maybe by considering that the second part is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which can be expanded as \\(\\sum_{k=0}^6 \\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - k}(1/c)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^6 \\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, when we multiply this by \\(a^2b^2\\), each term in the second expansion will multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\\), so the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be the sum over all \\(k\\) of \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\dbinom{6}{k}\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} \\times \\sum_{k=0}^6 \\dbinom{6}{k}\\). But \\(\\sum_{k=0}^6 \\dbinom{6}{k} = 2^6 = 64\\), so the total coefficient is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). \n\nWait, that seems correct. So, I think the answer is 384. But let me just make sure I'm not missing anything. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which comes only from the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any term in the second expansion. Since the second expansion has terms with various powers of \\(c\\), but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\), we have to sum all the coefficients from the second expansion and multiply by the coefficient from the first expansion. So yes, 6 times 64 is 384. \n\nI think that's the correct approach. So, the coefficient is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(2^6 = 64\\). Multiplying these gives \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\boxed{384}."

    "text": " So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Let me compute that: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient is 6. But wait, the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Hmm, does that affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)? Let me think. Since the second part is in terms of \\(c\\) and \\(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\), and the first part is in terms of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), they are independent variables. So, when I multiply the two expansions together, the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) will multiply with the terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\). But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I think that part is independent of \\(c\\). So, does that mean the coefficient remains 6 regardless of the second part? Wait, that doesn't seem right. Because when you multiply two expressions, each term from the first expression is multiplied by each term from the second. But since the second expression doesn't have any \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), the coefficients for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will just be 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. But wait, actually, no, because the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\). So, maybe I don't need to consider the second part at all? But that seems confusing because the entire expression is the product of both parts. Wait, let me think again. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), and when I multiply it by any term from the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the resulting term will have \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by some power of \\(c\\) or \\(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\). But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). Wait, no, that can't be. Because in the product, each term is a combination of powers of \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\), and \\(1/c\\). So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), that would include all possible terms where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2, regardless of the exponents of \\(c\\). But that's not possible because the second part doesn't have \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), so when you multiply, each term from the first part is multiplied by each term from the second part. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by any term from the second expression, you're just adding more factors, but the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the same as in the first part multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. Wait, that doesn't make sense. Let me think again. Suppose I have two expressions: \\(P(a, b)\\) and \\(Q(c)\\). Then, the product \\(P(a, b) \\cdot Q(c)\\) will have terms that are products of terms from \\(P\\) and terms from \\(Q\\). So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), that would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(P(a, b)\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(Q(c)\\). But that's not quite right because each term in \\(P(a, b)\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(Q(c)\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(P(a, b)\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(Q(c)\\). Because for each term in \\(P(a, b)\\), you multiply it by each term in \\(Q(c)\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would accumulate all the coefficients from \\(Q(c)\\) multiplied by the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(P(a, b)\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Now, to find the sum of all coefficients in the second part, I can substitute \\(c = 1\\). Because substituting \\(c = 1\\) into \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) gives the sum of all coefficients. So, let's compute that. When \\(c = 1\\), \\(\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = (1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of all coefficients in the second part is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 multiplied by 64, which is 6 * 64. Let me compute that: 6 * 60 = 360, and 6 * 4 = 24, so 360 + 24 = 384. So, the coefficient is 384. Wait, but let me double-check. Is that correct? Because I thought that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be 6, but considering the multiplication by the second part, which has 64 as the sum of coefficients, it becomes 6 * 64 = 384. Hmm, that seems high. Let me think again. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Since the second part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), when I multiply it by \\(a^2b^2\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), it would be 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which is 64, giving 384. Alternatively, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, which would include all possible powers of \\(c\\). But since \\(a^2b^2\\) is independent of \\(c\\), the coefficient would indeed be 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which is 64, giving 384. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\). In that case, I would need to find the term where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out, i.e., where the power of \\(c\\) is zero. Let me clarify the problem statement again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" It doesn't specify any particular power of \\(c\\), so I think it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, that would mean that the coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384. But wait, that seems too large. Let me check again. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only considering the term \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms, meaning \\(c^0\\). In that case, I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). So, that would require me to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, first, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, as before. Now, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is the middle term when expanded, which is when the exponents of \\(c\\) and \\(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\) cancel out. So, in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be zero, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\). So, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product is 6 * 20 = 120. Hmm, that makes more sense. So, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms, which would be 120. Wait, but the problem didn't specify \\(c^0\\), it just said the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, maybe I need to clarify whether it's considering all terms with \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), in which case it's 6 * 64 = 384, or if it's considering only the term where \\(c\\) cancels out, giving 120. Let me check the problem statement again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" It just says the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), without specifying any power of \\(c\\). So, in the product, each term is a product of a term from \\((a + b)^4\\) and a term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by every possible term from the second expression. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expression multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second expression. Because for each term in the first expression, you multiply it by each term in the second expression, so the coefficient accumulates. So, the sum of all coefficients in the second expression is when \\(c = 1\\), which is \\(2^6 = 64\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 * 64 = 384. But wait, that seems too high. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering only the term where \\(c\\) cancels out, i.e., \\(c^0\\), which would give 120. Hmm, I'm confused now. Let me think differently. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, when you expand it, each term is of the form \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}a^{4 - k}b^k \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - m}(1/c)^m\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\(k = 2\\) in the first part, as before. Then, in the second part, the exponent of \\(c\\) is \\(6 - 2m\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} \\times \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m}\\). Because for each \\(m\\), you're multiplying \\(a^2b^2\\) by a term from the second part. So, the sum of all coefficients in the second part is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} = 2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384. So, that would mean the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 384. But wait, if the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then yes, it's 384. However, if it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it's 120. Since the problem didn't specify, I think it's more likely that it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), so 384. But I'm not entirely sure. Let me check an example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, expanding, we get \\((a^2 + 2ab + b^2)(c + 1/c)\\). The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be zero because in the product, the highest power of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) is 2 each, but in the product, you can't get \\(a^2b^2\\) because each term is either \\(a^2\\), \\(2ab\\), or \\(b^2\\), multiplied by \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be zero because you can't get both \\(a^2\\) and \\(b^2\\) multiplied together in the product. Wait, that contradicts my earlier reasoning. Hmm, so in that case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be zero because you can't have both \\(a^2\\) and \\(b^2\\) in the same term when multiplied by the second expression. Wait, but in the original problem, \\((a + b)^4\\) does have a term \\(a^2b^2\\), and when you multiply by the second expression, each term from the first is multiplied by each term from the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would indeed be present in the product, multiplied by each term from the second expression. So, in the example I just thought of, \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would require both \\(a^2\\) and \\(b^2\\) to be multiplied together, but in \\((a + b)^2\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) isn't present because \\((a + b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2\\). So, there's no \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first place. Therefore, in that case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be zero. But in our original problem, \\((a + b)^4\\) does have an \\(a^2b^2\\) term, so when multiplied by the second expression, each term from the second expression would multiply \\(a^2b^2\\), so the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expression, which is 64, giving 384. So, in that case, the coefficient is 384. Alternatively, if the problem had been \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^2\\), then the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be present only if you multiply \\(a^2\\) from the first part by \\(b^2\\) from the first part, but since they're in separate parts, you can't get \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product unless you have a term that combines them, which you don't because the second part is separate. Wait, no, in the product, each term from the first part is multiplied by each term from the second part. So, in \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^2\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would require \\(a^2\\) multiplied by \\(b^2\\), but since they're in the same part, you can't get both \\(a^2\\) and \\(b^2\\) in the same term unless you have a term like \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which you don't in \\((a + b)^2\\). So, in that case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be zero. But in our original problem, \\((a + b)^4\\) does have an \\(a^2b^2\\) term, so when multiplied by the second expression, each term from the second expression is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expression, which is 64, giving 384. Therefore, the coefficient is 384. Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it, and the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and the second part is irrelevant because it's multiplied by terms that don't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\). But that doesn't make sense because when you multiply two expressions, each term from the first is multiplied by each term from the second, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second part. So, I think the correct answer is 384. But to be thorough, let me check another way. Let's consider that the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times (c + 1/c)^6\\). To find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), we can think of it as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\((c + 1/c)^6\\). Since the second part doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which is 64, giving 384. Alternatively, if we were to collect like terms, each term in the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second part. So, I think 384 is the correct answer. However, I'm still a bit uncertain because sometimes problems ask for specific terms, but in this case, I think 384 is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The sum of all coefficients in the second part is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\(2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n\\boxed{384}"

Hmm, so the entire expression is a product of two expansions. I think I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, which would involve considering how the terms from each expansion multiply together. But wait, the problem only asks for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and I notice that the second part of the expression is in terms of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), which don't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\). That means when I multiply the two expansions together, the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) will be multiplied by the terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). But since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product will just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) (since \\(a^2b^2\\) is like multiplying by 1, which is \\(c^0\\)) from the second part. \n\nSo, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me expand that using the binomial theorem as well. \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying the exponents, that becomes \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). I need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so I set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), I get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\).

Wait, that can't be, because that would make the coefficient a sum of all the terms in the expansion, which isn't correct. Alternatively, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me reread it: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, I think the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, in other words, when you multiply the two expressions, any term that has \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by some power of \\(c\\) (positive or negative) will contribute to the coefficient. But since the question is only about the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, it's just the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that would mean the coefficient is 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that can't be right because the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) would be when \\(c = 1\\), so substituting \\(c = 1\\), we get \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). So, would the coefficient be 6 * 64 = 384? Hmm, but I'm not sure if that's the correct approach. Let me think again. Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), when we multiply the two expressions, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by every term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384. But I'm not sure if that's what the problem is asking. Wait, maybe I'm misinterpreting the question. Let me check again: the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. So, in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term is a product of a term from \\((a + b)^4\\) and a term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\), and it's multiplied by every term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384. Wait, but that seems too large. Alternatively, maybe I'm supposed to consider that the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is combined with the terms from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but since \\(a^2b^2\\) is independent of \\(c\\), the coefficient would just be the product of the coefficients from each part. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, and the coefficient from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is... Wait, but \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) has multiple terms, each with their own coefficients. So, when you multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), each of those terms will contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times some power of \\(c\\). But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, that would mean that the coefficient is 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) has a coefficient, and when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), they contribute to the overall coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. So, to find the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), I can substitute \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384. But I'm not entirely sure if that's correct. Let me check another way. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, meaning that the term \\(a^2b^2\\) can be multiplied by any power of \\(c\\), but since the problem doesn't specify a particular power of \\(c\\), it's just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, that would again be 6 * 64 = 384. But I'm still a bit unsure. Let me think differently. Suppose I expand both parts separately. So, \\((a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. Now, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) can be expanded as \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, each term in this expansion is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\) for \\(k = 0\\) to \\(6\\). Now, when we multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), resulting in terms like \\(6a^2b^2 \\times \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 times the sum of all the coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because each term contributes \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}\\) times \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by some power of \\(c\\). Therefore, the total coefficient is 6 times the sum of \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}\\) for \\(k = 0\\) to \\(6\\), which is 6 * 2^6 = 6 * 64 = 384. So, I think that's the correct approach. Therefore, the coefficient is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplying it by the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is \\(2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the total coefficient is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n\\boxed{384}"

So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is being multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).

Wait, no, that's not quite right. Actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, and when we multiply by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a separate expression, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in that expansion. But since we're only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), that means we're looking for the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) because each term in that expansion will multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) and contribute to the overall coefficient. Wait, but actually, no. Let me clarify. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), and each of those terms has a coefficient. So, the overall coefficient would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Alternatively, since the sum of the coefficients in a polynomial is found by plugging in \\(c = 1\\), the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 * 64 = 384. Wait, but let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. Another way to think about it is that when you multiply two expressions together, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each expression. But in this case, \\(a^2b^2\\) is only present in \\((a + b)^4\\) and not in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), so when you multiply them, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would indeed be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 64. Therefore, 6 * 64 = 384. So, the coefficient is 384. Wait, but let me double-check. Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), and I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) don't affect the \\(c\\) terms. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all the coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, if I were to expand the entire product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), so each of those would contribute to the overall coefficient, which is why I need to multiply by the sum of the coefficients. So, yes, I think 384 is correct. Let me just confirm that the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is indeed 64. Plugging in \\(c = 1\\), we get \\((1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, that's correct.

So, the coefficient is 6. But wait, that's just for the first part. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, does that mean I have to multiply this coefficient by something else? Hmm, maybe not directly, because \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) are separate variables from \\(a\\) and \\(b\\).

But that can't be, because then the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\), not just a number. Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but since the entire expression is a product of two polynomials, each involving different variables, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the entire second part. But that doesn't make sense because the coefficient should be a number, not an expression in \\(c\\). Hmm, maybe I need to clarify. Let me think again. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when expanded, it's a product of two polynomials. Each term in the first polynomial is a term in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and each term in the second is a term in \\(c\\). So, when multiplied together, each term will be a product of an \\(a\\), \\(b\\) term and a \\(c\\) term. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems odd because the coefficient would then be a polynomial in \\(c\\), but the question is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term in the product. Wait, perhaps the question is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) or something, but it's not specified. Wait, let me check the original problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, it's only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). That means that in the product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) can be multiplied by any power of \\(c\\), so the coefficient would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the entire second part. But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), but the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. So, perhaps I'm misinterpreting the question. Maybe the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), that is, the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\), which is 1. Alternatively, maybe it's just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which would be the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Wait, but the sum of all coefficients in the second part is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), so \\(\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times 64, which is 384. But I'm not sure if that's what the problem is asking. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, considering all possible powers of \\(c\\). But that doesn't make sense because the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\), and the problem is likely expecting a numerical answer. So, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, which seems unlikely. Alternatively, maybe the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would involve multiplying the term \\(a^2b^2\\) by the term \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion. Let me think about that. So, if I consider the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part, which has coefficient 6, and then multiply it by the term \\(c^0\\) from the second part, which is the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), I can use the binomial theorem again. The expansion is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(1/c\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). The term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0 is when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\), which is 20. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire expression is 6 times 20, which is 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) (assuming they mean \\(a^2b^2c^0\\)) is 120. Alternatively, if they just want the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), then it would be 6 times the entire expansion, which is not a number. So, I think the correct interpretation is that they want the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. Let me double-check that. So, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. In \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the constant term is 20. Therefore, when multiplied together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is 6 * 20 = 120. Yes, that makes sense. So, the final answer should be 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20.

However, the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). Wait, that might not make sense. Let me clarify: The original expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when you expand this, you'll have terms like \\(a^kb^{4 - k} \\times c^m\\) or \\(a^kb^{4 - k} \\times c^{-m}\\), where \\(k\\) ranges from 0 to 4, and \\(m\\) ranges depending on the expansion of the second binomial.

Wait, no, that's not correct. Because the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), is a Laurent polynomial, meaning it can have positive and negative exponents of \\(c\\). So, when we multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, each term will have a different power of \\(c\\). But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), we can consider that the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. But that would mean the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion, which doesn't make sense because we're supposed to get a numerical coefficient. Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think differently. The problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\), and \\(1/c\\) are all separate variables, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will come from multiplying \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part by any term from the second part. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), we can consider that the coefficient is just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Wait, that makes more sense. Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, each of those terms contributes to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. So, the total coefficient is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Therefore, I need to compute the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). How do I find the sum of all coefficients in a Laurent polynomial? Well, the sum of coefficients in a polynomial is found by substituting 1 for all variables. So, if I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) becomes \\((1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the sum of all coefficients in the second part is 64. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 64 (sum of coefficients in the second part), which is 6 * 64 = 384. Wait, that seems high. Let me check my reasoning again. Alternatively, maybe I'm supposed to consider that the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, but since we're only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\), we can consider that each term in the second expansion contributes its own coefficient to the product term \\(a^2b^2c^m\\), but since we don't care about \\(m\\), we just sum all the coefficients from the second expansion and multiply by the coefficient from the first part. So, yes, that would make the coefficient 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, another way to think about it is that the entire expression is the product of two independent expansions, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the coefficient from the first expansion times the sum of coefficients from the second expansion. Since the second expansion's sum of coefficients is 64, the total coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) can be found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem, which is 6. Next, we find the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) by substituting \\(c = 1\\), resulting in \\(2^6 = 64\\). Multiplying these together gives \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n\\boxed{384}"

    "text": " So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\\). So, the coefficient from the first part is 6. Now, the expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but the problem is only asking about the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Does that mean I don't need to consider the second part? Hmm, maybe not. Let me think. The second part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), and when expanded, it will have terms involving powers of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), not involving \\(c\\), perhaps the second part doesn't affect the coefficient? Wait, no, that doesn't make sense. Because the entire expression is the product of \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), so when you multiply them out, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But wait, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), maybe we're considering the coefficient in the entire expansion. But that seems a bit unclear. Wait, perhaps I need to clarify: when the problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", is it considering the term \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by any combination of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), or just the term \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms? Hmm, I think it's the latter. Because if it's the former, the coefficient would actually be a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make much sense. So, perhaps the question is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating \\(c\\) as an independent variable, but only considering the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2. So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't seem right either, because the question is asking for a numerical coefficient, not a polynomial. Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me read the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, perhaps the question is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. That is, when you expand the entire expression, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by some combination of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), but the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the sum of all the coefficients from the \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) expansion, multiplied by 6. Wait, that might be it. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But the sum of all the coefficients in a polynomial is found by setting all variables to 1. So, if I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = (1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the sum of all coefficients is 64. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 * 64 = 384. But wait, is that correct? Let me think again. If I have \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), then each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6\\(a^2b^2\\), and then multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Because each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) contributes a coefficient, and when multiplied by 6, gives the total coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\). So, as I calculated earlier, the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. Therefore, the coefficient is 384. Wait, but let me check that again. Alternatively, maybe I should think of it as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just 6, and then multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but the problem is asking for the coefficient, which would then be 6 times the entire expansion, but that doesn't make sense because the coefficient should be a number, not a polynomial. So, perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient in the sense of the term \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, meaning that it's 6 times the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is misinterpreted, and the question is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), that is, the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2, and the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0. In that case, we would need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, let me think about that. The coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is the middle term, which is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\), because when you have \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - k}(1/c)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, to find the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, we set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it's 6 * 20 = 120. But the problem didn't specify the exponent of \\(c\\), just \\(a^2b^2\\). Hmm, so perhaps the problem is expecting the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, meaning that it's 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but that would make the coefficient a polynomial, which doesn't make sense. Alternatively, maybe the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable, so the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion, but that's not a number. So, perhaps the problem is expecting the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when considering the entire expression as a polynomial in \\(a, b, c\\), and the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, maybe the problem is expecting the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 6 * 20 = 120. Hmm, I'm a bit confused. Let me see if I can find similar problems or think about it differently. When you have a product of two expressions, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each factor. But in this case, \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) are separate, so the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from \\((a + b)^4\\), and it's multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which is not a single number. Therefore, perhaps the problem is misinterpreted, and it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating \\(c\\) as a variable, but only considering the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2, regardless of \\(c\\). In that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but that's not a single number. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, considering \\(c\\) as a variable, but the question is a bit ambiguous. Wait, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, which is 6, because the other part is multiplied by it, but that doesn't make sense because the entire expression is a product, so the coefficient would be 6 times something. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only considering the terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by a specific term in the other expansion, but without more context, it's hard to tell. Wait, maybe I should think of it as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, meaning the sum of all coefficients from the \\(c\\) terms multiplied by 6. So, that would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384. So, perhaps that's the answer. Alternatively, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), it's 6 * 20 = 120. But since the problem didn't specify the exponent of \\(c\\), I think it's more likely that it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), so 384. But I'm not entirely sure. Let me check the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, it's just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), without specifying anything about \\(c\\). So, perhaps the answer is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, maybe it's 6 times the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 20, so 6 * 20 = 120. Hmm, I'm still confused. Let me think about how the product works. When you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term is the sum of the products of coefficients of terms whose exponents add up to the desired term. But in this case, \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) are separate, so the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is multiplied by every term in the second part. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, which doesn't make sense. Therefore, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when considering only the terms where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out, i.e., \\(c^0\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 20 = 120. So, perhaps the answer is 120. Alternatively, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), meaning that it's 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384. But I'm not sure which interpretation is correct. Let me see if I can find a similar problem or think of it differently. Suppose I expand \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) separately. Then, when I multiply them, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first expansion and is multiplied by every term in the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, not a single number. So, perhaps the problem is misinterpreted, and it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 6 * 20 = 120. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable, so the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion, but that's not a single number. Therefore, perhaps the intended answer is 120, considering only the constant term in the \\(c\\) expansion. So, I think the answer is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6.

Hmm, so maybe the question is only concerned with the part that involves \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the rest can be considered as coefficients. So, perhaps the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because when you multiply, each term in the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part, and since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients in the second expansion.

Wait, no, that doesn't seem right. Let me think again. When you multiply two expressions, the coefficients of the terms in the product are the products of the coefficients of the terms in the original expressions. So, if I have \\((a + b)^4\\) times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), then each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which has a coefficient of 6, is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^k\\) (for various \\(k\\)) would be 6 times the coefficients of those terms in the second expansion. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for any specific \\(k\\). Hmm, that's confusing. Wait, maybe I'm misinterpreting the problem. It says, \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, perhaps it's considering the entire expression as a polynomial in \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\), and \\(1/c\\), and it's asking for the coefficient of the term \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, in other words, we're looking for all terms in the expansion where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2, and the exponents of \\(c\\) can be anything. Therefore, the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) has a coefficient, and when multiplied by 6, it contributes to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times that term in \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Now, how do I find the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)? Well, the sum of the coefficients in a polynomial is found by setting all variables to 1. So, if I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = (2)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 64. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 times 64, which is 384. Wait, that seems high. Let me check that again. So, if I have \\((a + b)^4\\) and I know that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. Then, when I multiply by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which when expanded has terms with various powers of \\(c\\), each multiplied by their coefficients. So, when I multiply 6 by each of those coefficients, the total coefficient for \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) is 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^k\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in other words, it's the sum over all \\(k\\) of 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^k\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Therefore, that sum is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 times 64, which is 384. So, the coefficient is 384. Alternatively, maybe I'm making a mistake here. Let me think differently. Perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, so that the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would have a coefficient that is a polynomial in \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). But the problem doesn't specify any particular power of \\(c\\), so maybe it's just asking for the coefficient in front of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which would mean that the coefficient is 6 times that expansion. But that doesn't make sense because a coefficient should be a number, not a polynomial. Wait, perhaps I'm misinterpreting the question. Maybe it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), that is, the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2, and the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0. That would make sense because then the coefficient would be a number. So, if that's the case, I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product. So, let's approach it that way. So, first, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, as we found earlier. Now, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is the middle term when expanded, which is when the exponents of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) are equal. So, in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0 is the central term, which is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}c^3 \\times (1/c)^3 = \\dbinom{6}{3}c^0 = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire expression is 6 times 20, which is 120. So, the answer would be 120. Wait, that seems more reasonable. So, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), which is 120. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which would be 6 times the entire expansion, but that would make the coefficient a polynomial, which doesn't make sense. So, I think the correct interpretation is that it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. Let me confirm that. So, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. In \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, when you multiply these two parts, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is 6 * 20 = 120. So, that should be the answer. Alternatively, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without considering \\(c\\), then the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because coefficients are typically constants.

    "text": " So, the coefficient would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\), which is 6. So, the term is \\(6a^2b^2\\). \n\nWait a minute, but the expression isn't just \\((a + b)^4\\); it's multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I need to consider how this multiplication affects the coefficient. Let me think. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\), and when multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not considering the other variables \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Maybe the question is only asking about the coefficient in the entire expression, considering all variables. Wait, no, let me read the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, in other words, I need to find how many times \\(a^2b^2\\) appears when multiplying the two expansions together, considering all possible terms from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nWait, but actually, when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, no, that doesn't sound right. Because when you multiply, each term from the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second. So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I need to consider all possible products where the product includes \\(a^2b^2\\) and any term from the second polynomial. But since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term in \\((a + b)^4\\), when multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), it will contribute to terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) and \\(a^2b^2c^{-k}\\), but the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) itself in the product would just be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, that might be the case. \n\nLet me think again. If I have \\((a + b)^4 = A\\), and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = B\\), then the product is \\(A \\times B\\). So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), that term in \\(A\\) is \\(6a^2b^2\\), and when multiplied by \\(B\\), it becomes \\(6a^2b^2 \\times B\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be \\(6 \\times\\) the sum of all coefficients in \\(B\\). Because when you multiply \\(6a^2b^2\\) by each term in \\(B\\), each term adds a multiple of \\(a^2b^2\\) times some power of \\(c\\). But since the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\), it's equivalent to the coefficient in \\(A\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(B\\). \n\nSo, to find the sum of all coefficients in \\(B = \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), I can substitute \\(c = 1\\). Because substituting \\(c = 1\\) into \\(B\\) gives the sum of all coefficients. Let's compute that. When \\(c = 1\\), \\(B\\) becomes \\((1 + 1/1)^6 = (2)^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of all coefficients in \\(B\\) is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\(A \\times B\\) is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). \n\nWait, but let me check if that's correct. Because sometimes, when you have negative exponents, substituting \\(c = 1\\) might not capture all terms correctly, but in this case, since all terms in \\(B\\) are of the form \\(c^k\\) where \\(k\\) ranges from -6 to 6 in steps of 2, substituting \\(c = 1\\) should still give the correct sum because \\(c^k = 1^k = 1\\) for any \\(k\\). So, yes, 64 is correct. Therefore, the coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I can approach this differently. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, as I found earlier. Then, when you multiply by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second part, which is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 64, as before. So, 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nWait, but let me confirm by another method. Maybe I can compute the product directly. Let's consider that \\((a + b)^4\\) has terms up to \\(a^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) has terms from \\(c^6\\) down to \\(c^{-6}\\). But when we multiply them, the terms involving \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by all terms in the second polynomial, but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, we can treat the second polynomial as a constant with respect to \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of it as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the same as the coefficient in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nWait, but let me check if I'm not making a mistake here. Let me think about how the coefficients work when multiplying two polynomials. Suppose I have two polynomials P(a, b) and Q(c, 1/c). Then, the product P(a, b) * Q(c, 1/c) will have terms like (term from P) * (term from Q). So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of c, then for each term in P that is \\(a^2b^2\\), it will be multiplied by each term in Q, which is a term in c. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in P times the sum of all coefficients in Q. Because each term in Q contributes a coefficient that gets multiplied by the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in P. \n\nSo, in this case, P is \\((a + b)^4\\), and Q is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in P is 6, and the sum of all coefficients in Q is 64, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I can compute the sum of coefficients in Q another way. The sum of coefficients in Q is obtained by setting all variables to 1, so \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\), as before. \n\nWait, but let me think again. Suppose I have Q = \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). If I expand this, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(1/c\\right)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, the coefficients are \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}\\) for each term. The sum of all coefficients is when \\(c = 1\\), so indeed, it's \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, the sum is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nWait, but let me make sure that I'm not missing anything. Is there a possibility that the term \\(a^2b^2\\) could be formed in another way when multiplying the two polynomials? For example, maybe by combining terms from both polynomials in a way that the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) add up to 2 each. But in this case, since \\((a + b)^4\\) is separate from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), and there's no overlap in variables, the only way \\(a^2b^2\\) can be formed is from the first polynomial. The second polynomial only involves \\(c\\), so it doesn't contribute to the exponents of \\(a\\) or \\(b\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is indeed the coefficient from the first polynomial times the sum of all coefficients from the second polynomial. \n\nSo, to recap: Coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. Sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 64. Therefore, the coefficient in the product is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nI think that's the correct answer. Let me just double-check my steps. \n\n1. Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) has coefficient \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n\n2. The other part of the expression is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). To find the sum of its coefficients, substitute \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\(2^6 = 64\\).\n\n3. Multiply these two results together: 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nYes, that seems correct. I don't see any mistakes in the reasoning.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is found using the binomial coefficient \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). The sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), giving \\(2^6 = 64\\). Multiplying these together gives \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n\\boxed{384}"

So, the coefficient is 6. But wait, the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I think I need to consider how this multiplication affects the coefficient. But hold on, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\). So, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't have any \\(c\\) terms, that means we need to find the term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) that has \\(c^0\\), because multiplying by \\(c^0\\) (which is 1) won't change the exponent of \\(c\\). So, in other words, we need the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me check that. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is \\(6a^2b^2\\). When I multiply this by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) will be \\(6\\) multiplied by the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, now I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Again, using the binomial theorem, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying the exponents, that's \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m} = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We want the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, because that's the constant term. So, set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20. Now, going back to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes. So, the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the constant term from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 20. Multiplying them together gives 120. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120. Alternatively, maybe I can think of it another way. Since the two parts are multiplied together, the coefficients multiply as well, provided that the terms don't interfere with each other. Since \\(a^2b^2\\) is in the first part and the constant term is in the second part, their product will contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression.

So, the coefficient is 6. Now, the expression also has the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I notice that this part doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), so when I multiply the two expansions together, the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) will multiply with the terms from the second expansion. But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I think I don't need to consider the terms involving \\(c\\) because they won't affect the exponent of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). Wait, is that correct? Let me think. When I multiply two polynomials, each term from the first polynomial will multiply each term from the second polynomial. So, if I'm looking for a term that has \\(a^2b^2\\), that term would come from multiplying \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion with a term from the second expansion that has \\(c^0\\), because \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\).

So, the constant term is when \\(m = 3\\), and that term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} c^{0} = \\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\), that's \\(6! / (3! * 3!) = (720) / (6 * 6) = 720 / 36 = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20.

It says, \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, it's looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and that term will be multiplied by various powers of \\(c\\), but the coefficient itself doesn't depend on \\(c\\). So, the coefficient is just 6, regardless of what happens with the \\(c\\) terms. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. Wait, but maybe I'm oversimplifying. Let me think again. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^4 = 6a^2b^2 + \\text{other terms}\\), and then I multiply that by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), resulting in terms like \\(6a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(6a^2b^2c^4\\), etc. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not considering the \\(c\\) terms. So, in the entire product, \\(a^2b^2\\) will appear multiplied by each term from the second expansion, but the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) itself is just 6 times the sum of all the coefficients from the second expansion. Wait, no, that's not right. Because when you multiply \\(6a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, you get terms like \\(6a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(6a^2b^2c^4\\), etc., but each of these has a different power of \\(c\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) itself, without considering \\(c\\), would be 6 multiplied by the sum of the coefficients of each term in the second expansion.

So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in the second expansion. But the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\). So, let's compute that. The second expansion is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Setting \\(c = 1\\), we get \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 * 64 = 384. Wait, that makes more sense. Because when you multiply \\(6a^2b^2\\) by the entire expansion of the second part, each term in the second expansion contributes a coefficient, and since we're interested in all possible terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present, regardless of the power of \\(c\\), the total coefficient is 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64. So, 6 * 64 = 384. Therefore, the coefficient is 384. Wait, but let me double-check that logic. Alternatively, perhaps the coefficient is just 6, because the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. But that doesn't seem right because the second expansion has multiple terms, each of which would multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term, effectively contributing to the coefficient. Hmm, no, actually, when you have a product of two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each polynomial. But in this case, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term is only in the first polynomial, and the second polynomial doesn't have any \\(a\\) or \\(b\\) terms. So, when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second polynomial, you're just adding \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by each term, but the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is just the coefficient from the first polynomial times the entire second polynomial. Wait, that's not accurate because each term in the second polynomial has different powers of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would actually be the coefficient from the first polynomial times the sum of all the coefficients in the second polynomial. Because when you multiply \\(6a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, you get terms like \\(6a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(6a^2b^2c^4\\), etc., and if you're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), you have to sum all those contributions. But wait, no, because each term is a separate term with different exponents of \\(c\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^6\\) is 6, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^4\\) is 6, and so on. But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would be the sum of all the coefficients of terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present, regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, that would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. Since the sum of coefficients in the second expansion is 64, as I calculated earlier, the total coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384. So, I think that's correct. Let me confirm by another approach. Alternatively, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first part, which has a coefficient of 6. The second part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), can be expanded, and each term in that expansion will multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 multiplied by the sum of the coefficients of all terms in the second expansion. The sum of the coefficients in the second expansion is indeed \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\), so 6 * 64 = 384. Therefore, the coefficient is 384. Wait, but let me think again. Suppose I don't consider the second expansion. If I just have \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. Now, when I multiply by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is a separate polynomial, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial will be multiplied by each term in the second polynomial, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), etc. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). That is, it's looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by any power of \\(c\\). So, in effect, we're looking for all terms in the product that have \\(a^2b^2\\), and summing their coefficients. Since each such term is \\(6a^2b^2\\) multiplied by a term from the second expansion, the coefficient for each of these is 6 times the coefficient of that term in the second expansion. Therefore, the total coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. So, I think that's correct. Alternatively, if the problem had asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for a specific \\(k\\), then it would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^k\\) in the second expansion. But since it's just \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\), the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. Therefore, the coefficient is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Then, since the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is multiplied by this term, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. The sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), giving \\(2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the total coefficient is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n\\boxed{384}"

So, the coefficient is 6. \n\nNow, the expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). That means I don't need to consider the \\(c\\) terms because \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\). So, maybe I can treat \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) separately and then multiply the coefficients. \n\nWait, but actually, when you multiply two expressions together, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression. So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I need to consider that term in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by every possible term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, that doesn't make sense because the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) would include many terms with different powers of \\(c\\). However, the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\). So, perhaps the coefficient is just 6 times whatever the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is. But that seems off because the problem is asking for a specific coefficient, not an expression involving \\(c\\). Maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem.\n\nWait, let me read the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. That is, when you multiply out the entire expression, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by some combination of \\(c\\) terms, but the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the sum of all those combinations. Wait, no, that can't be right because \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), so when you multiply it by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), it would be multiplied by the entire expansion of that part. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems like a lot. Alternatively, maybe I'm supposed to consider only the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because if I multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by a term involving \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), then the resulting term would have \\(c\\) in it, but since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), perhaps it's considering only the terms where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, so that \\(a^2b^2\\) stands alone without any \\(c\\) terms. That makes more sense. So, maybe I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is the constant term, and then multiply that by 6.\n\nLet me check that approach. So, first, find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6. Then, find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), and then multiply those two coefficients together to get the final coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression. That seems correct because when you multiply the two expressions, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, but only the constant term (i.e., the term with \\(c^0\\)) will result in a term that is just \\(a^2b^2\\). All other terms would have some power of \\(c\\), which would make them \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some \\(k\\), but since the problem is only asking for \\(a^2b^2\\), we're only interested in the term where \\(k = 0\\).\n\nSo, now, let's find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Again, using the binomial theorem, we can expand this as \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We want the exponent of \\(c\\) to be zero, so we set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). So, the coefficient is 20.\n\nNow, going back to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nWait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake. So, \\((a + b)^4\\) gives 6 for \\(a^2b^2\\), and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) gives 20 for \\(c^0\\). Multiplying them gives 120. That seems correct. Alternatively, maybe I should consider that the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), and when you expand it, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term is 6, and it's multiplied by every term in the second expansion, but only the constant term (20) contributes to \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms. So, yes, 6 times 20 is 120. I think that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of the entire expression as a product of two expansions, and the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, but that doesn't make sense because the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) would be when \\(c = 1\\), which is \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\), but that's not the same as the constant term. So, no, I think my initial approach is correct: only the constant term in the second expansion contributes to the \\(a^2b^2\\) term without any \\(c\\) attached.\n\nWait, let me confirm that. So, if I have \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by, say, \\(c^3\\), that would be \\(a^2b^2c^3\\), which is a different term. Similarly, \\(a^2b^2 \\times 1/c^2\\) would be \\(a^2b^2c^{-2}\\). But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which implies that the exponent of \\(c\\) should be zero. Therefore, only the term where \\(c\\) is raised to the zero power, i.e., the constant term, will contribute to \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient is indeed 6 times 20, which is 120.\n\nWait, but let me make sure that I'm not missing anything else. So, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\) at all. Therefore, in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the only way to get a term with \\(a^2b^2\\) is to multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part by the constant term from the second part. So, that's 6 times 20, which is 120. Therefore, the coefficient is 120.\n\nI think that's the correct approach. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning. So, the final answer should be 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Multiplying these gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\boxed{120}."

Wait, no, that doesn't sound right. Let me think again. Actually, when you multiply two expressions, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by every term in the second part. But since the second part doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the entire expansion of the second part. Wait, but that would mean that the coefficient isn't just a number but an expression involving \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which I think implies that we're treating \\(c\\) as a variable independent of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), so perhaps the coefficient is actually the product of the coefficient from the first part and the entire second expansion. Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try another approach. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable. So, in other words, when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the only term that contributes to \\(a^2b^2\\) is the term from \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that would mean the coefficient is not a single number but a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for a coefficient, so maybe I'm misunderstanding. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). That is, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by some combination of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a sum of terms involving \\(c\\). Hmm, perhaps I should re-examine the problem statement. It says, \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, the coefficient would include any terms involving \\(c\\), so the coefficient is actually a polynomial in \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(6 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because from the first part, the coefficient is 6, and it's multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. So, the coefficient would be \\(6 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But maybe the problem wants the coefficient in terms of \\(c\\), or perhaps it's asking for the coefficient when considering all variables together. Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Alternatively, maybe the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when the entire expression is expanded, treating \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) as independent variables. So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all the terms in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that doesn't make sense because each term in the expansion would have different powers of \\(c\\). Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, so the coefficient would be \\(6 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that seems odd. Wait, maybe I'm missing something. Let me think again. When you have two separate expressions multiplied together, like \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), when you expand them, the terms are all combinations where each term from the first expansion is multiplied by each term from the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion is \\(6a^2b^2\\), and it gets multiplied by every term in the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be \\(6 \\times\\) the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems too broad. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, without considering \\(c\\). But that doesn't make sense because \\(c\\) is part of the expression. Wait, maybe the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when the entire expression is considered as a product, so the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\). So, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is correct. Alternatively, perhaps the problem wants the coefficient when the entire expression is expanded, but considering all variables, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would include all possible powers of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Alternatively, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem, and it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, but that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which seems unlikely. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating \\(c\\) as a constant, but that doesn't make much sense either. Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me try to think differently. Let's consider the entire expression: \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When expanded, each term will be of the form \\(a^k b^{4 - k} \\times c^m \\times \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^n\\), where \\(k\\) ranges from 0 to 4, and \\(m + n = 6\\) for the second part. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would come from the first part when \\(k = 2\\), which is \\(6a^2b^2\\), and then multiplied by every term in the second part, which is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\), since \\(n = 6 - m\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be \\(6 \\times \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, that would be the coefficient, which is \\(6 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient in terms of \\(c\\), so maybe they just want the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, and then the second part is treated as a separate expansion. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, so that would be the constant term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me check that possibility. If that's the case, then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). So, let's see. The constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) occurs when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, which happens when \\(m = 3\\), because \\(c^{6 - 2m}\\) would be \\(c^0\\) when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) would be \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). But the problem didn't specify anything about \\(c\\), so maybe that's not what it's asking. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which would be \\(6 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But I'm not sure. Let me think again. The problem says, \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, perhaps it's considering the entire product and asking for the coefficient of the term \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would be \\(6 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) would be multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), so the coefficient is \\(6 \\times\\) the entire expansion of the second part. Alternatively, maybe the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable, so the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But perhaps the problem is more straightforward, and it's just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and the second part is just a multiplier, so the overall coefficient is 6 times the entire second expansion. But that seems odd. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which would involve multiplying the coefficient from the first part by the entire second part. So, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Alternatively, maybe the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when considering the entire product, which would be 6 times the sum of all terms in the second expansion, but that's not correct because each term in the second expansion has different powers of \\(c\\). So, perhaps the correct approach is to recognize that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Alternatively, maybe the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating \\(c\\) as a variable, so the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), specifically \\(6 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But perhaps the problem is expecting a numerical coefficient, implying that they want the term where \\(c\\) is raised to a specific power, but since it's not specified, I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating, and the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and the second part is irrelevant because it's multiplied by terms involving \\(c\\). But that doesn't make sense because the problem includes both parts. Wait, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present and the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. That would make sense because then we're considering the term where the product has \\(a^2b^2\\) and no net power of \\(c\\). So, let me try that approach. So, first, find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6. Then, find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The constant term occurs when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. So, in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We want the exponent \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire product is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Therefore, the coefficient is 120. But wait, the problem didn't specify \\(c^0\\), so maybe that's not what it's asking. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, so the coefficient would be \\(6 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems too involved. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which would be \\(6 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that's a polynomial in \\(c\\), not a single number. So, perhaps the problem is expecting a numerical coefficient, implying that they want the term where the exponents of \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are as specified. Alternatively, maybe the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable, so the coefficient is \\(6 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But I'm not sure. Let me try to see if I can find a better approach. Another way to think about it is to consider the entire product and how the terms interact. So, \\((a + b)^4\\) expands to terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) expands to terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). When you multiply these together, each term from the first expansion is multiplied by each term from the second. Therefore, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion will be multiplied by every term from the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is \\(6 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because each term in the second expansion is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But if the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, perhaps they want the coefficient when considering all variables, but that's not possible because \\(c\\) is a separate variable. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which would be \\(6 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, maybe that's the answer. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which is \\(6 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), so the coefficient is \\(6 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But perhaps the problem is expecting a numerical value, so maybe I'm missing something. Let me check again. The problem is: What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, perhaps the answer is simply 6, because that's the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, and the second part is just another factor. But that seems incorrect because the entire product would have terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by various powers of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is \\(6 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Alternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), which would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of the second part. So, I think that's the correct approach. Therefore, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But to express this as a single expression, I can write it as \\(6 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Alternatively, if I expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), it would be \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\), so the coefficient would be \\(6 \\times \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is \\(6 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But perhaps the problem is expecting a numerical coefficient, so maybe I'm overcomplicating. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which is 6 times the expansion of the second part. Therefore, the coefficient is \\(6 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Alternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which would be 6 times the entire expansion of the second part. So, I think that's the answer. Therefore, the coefficient is \\(6 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But let me check again. The problem says, \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, the coefficient would be the product of the coefficients from each part. Since \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\) with coefficient 6, and the other part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a separate expansion, so the coefficient is \\(6 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, that's the answer. Therefore, the coefficient is \\(6 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, perhaps the problem is expecting a numerical coefficient, so maybe I'm misunderstanding. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when the entire product is considered, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, so the coefficient is \\(6 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I think that's the correct approach. Therefore, the coefficient is \\(6 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nWait, but let me think again. Maybe the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which is \\(6 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Alternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of the powers of \\(c\\), so the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(6 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Alternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which would be 6 times the entire expansion of the second part. So, I think that's the answer.\n\nWait, but let me try a different approach. Let's consider that when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficients multiply. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20, as I calculated earlier. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). So, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), the answer is 120. But the problem didn't specify \\(c^0\\), so perhaps that's not what it's asking. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which is \\(6 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), so the coefficient is \\(6 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But if the problem is expecting a numerical coefficient, then perhaps I'm misunderstanding. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of \\(c\\), so the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I think that's the answer.\n\nWait, but maybe I should just stick with the initial approach. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and when you multiply by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the coefficient becomes \\(6 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(6 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, that's the answer.\n\nWait, but let me check if I'm not making a mistake here. When you have two separate expressions multiplied together, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each expression. But in this case, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is only present in the first expression, and the second expression doesn't have any \\(a\\) or \\(b\\) terms, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is indeed 6 times the entire expansion of the second expression. So, yes, the coefficient is \\(6 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable, so the coefficient is \\(6 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the answer is \\(6 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nWait, but perhaps the problem is expecting a numerical coefficient, so maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me think again. If the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of \\(c\\), then the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of the second part, which is a polynomial in \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(6 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which would be \\(6 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I think that's the correct answer.\n\nWait, but let me think about another way. If I expand \\((a + b)^4\\), I get terms like \\(a^4\\), \\(4a^3b\\), \\(6a^2b^2\\), \\(4ab^3\\), and \\(b^4\\). Each of these terms is then multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by every term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which means that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is \\(6 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Therefore, that's the coefficient.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which is \\(6 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, that's the answer.\n\nWait, but perhaps the problem is expecting a numerical coefficient, so maybe I'm missing something. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which is \\(6 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I think that's the correct answer.\n\nWait, but let me check if I'm not making a mistake. Let me take a simpler example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, expanding, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^0\\) would be 1 times \\((c + 1/c)\\), so the coefficient is \\(c + 1/c\\). Similarly, the coefficient of \\(a^1b^1\\) would be 2 times \\((c + 1/c)\\), so \\(2(c + 1/c)\\). So, in that case, the coefficient is indeed the coefficient from the first part times the entire expansion of the second part. Therefore, in the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(6 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nTherefore, I think that's the answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{6 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6}.\n\nWait, but in the problem statement, the user mentioned to put the final answer in a box, so perhaps they expect a numerical value. Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake earlier. Let me think again. Wait, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, which would be the product of the coefficients from each part. But the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), when expanded, is a polynomial in \\(c\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times that polynomial. So, the coefficient is \\(6 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is the answer.\n\nBut wait, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which is \\(6 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be 6 times the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20, so 6 \u00d7 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient is 120.\n\nWait, let me check that approach again. If the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, considering all variables, then perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present and \\(c\\) is raised to the zero power. In that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20, so 6 \u00d7 20 = 120.

    "text": " So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Let me calculate that: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient from the first part is 6. Now, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the second part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I also need to expand this using the binomial theorem. So, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying that, each term becomes \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m} = \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, each term has \\(c^{6 - 2m}\\). Now, since the entire expression is the product of \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), when we multiply these two expansions together, each term from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term from the second expansion. But wait, the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). That means we only need to consider the term in the first expansion that is \\(a^2b^2\\) and multiply it by every term in the second expansion. However, since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and the second part doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression will just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire second expansion. Wait, no, that's not quite right. Wait, actually, no, because when you multiply the two expressions together, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But since the second expansion only has terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. However, since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), we need to find the part of the product where the \\(a^2b^2\\) term is multiplied by a term in the second expansion that is \\(c^0\\), because that's the only way to get a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\). So, in other words, we need to find the term in the second expansion where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. Because when we multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by \\(c^0\\), we get \\(a^2b^2\\) times 1, which is just \\(a^2b^2\\), and that's the term we're interested in. So, first, let's find the term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. From earlier, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, we set the exponent \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(6 - 2m = 0\\) \u21d2 \\(2m = 6\\) \u21d2 \\(m = 3\\). So, the term where \\(m = 3\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} c^{0}\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} \\times 1\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). So, the coefficient from the second part is 20. Now, since the entire expression is the product of the two expansions, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression will be the product of the coefficient from the first part and the coefficient from the second part. So, that's 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the second part). So, 6 \u00d7 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is 120. Wait, let me just double-check that I didn't make a mistake. So, in the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). In the second part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term where \\(c\\) is raised to zero is when \\(m = 3\\), which gives \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying these together, 6 \u00d7 20 = 120.

Simplifying each term, that becomes \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m} = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, each term has an exponent of \\(6 - 2m\\). The constant term is where the exponent is zero. So, set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which gives \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Wait, is that correct? Let me double-check. So, the first part gives 6 for \\(a^2b^2\\), and the second part's constant term is 20, so when you multiply them, the coefficient becomes 6 * 20 = 120. That seems right. Alternatively, maybe I can think about it another way. When you multiply two polynomials, the coefficients multiply. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6a^2b^2, and in the second part, the constant term is 20, so when you multiply 6a^2b^2 by 20, you get 120a^2b^2. So, the coefficient is indeed 120. I don't think I made a mistake here. Let me just make sure I didn't overlook anything. The problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so terms involving \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\) don't affect that coefficient because they would multiply with other terms, but since we're only interested in \\(a^2b^2\\), the only way that can happen is if we take the constant term from the second part, which is 20, and multiply it by the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part, which is 6. So, 6 * 20 = 120. Yeah, I think that's correct.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is found by considering the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). The constant term in the second expansion is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying these together gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\boxed{120}"

So, the coefficient is 6. But wait, the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, does that affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)? Hmm, let me think. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) is part of the first part of the product, and when we multiply it by the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we might get cross terms. But actually, the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, does that mean we're considering the entire product and looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the powers of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\)? Or does it mean something else? Wait, maybe I need to clarify. The problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", which I think means that we're looking for the coefficient when the entire expression is expanded, and we collect all terms that have \\(a^2b^2\\). So, each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, for each term in \\((a + b)^4\\), we'll have a coefficient multiplied by a term in the other expansion. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is 6, as we found earlier, that term will be multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, does that mean the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)? Wait, no, that doesn't seem right. Because when you multiply two expressions, each term from the first is multiplied by each term from the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\), and when multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), it will generate terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) and \\(a^2b^2 \\dfrac{1}{c^k}\\) for various \\(k\\). But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would include all the terms where the variables \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are squared, but the \\(c\\) terms can vary. Wait, but in the entire product, \\(a^2b^2\\) is just a part of the term. So, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Alternatively, perhaps the question is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) as separate variables. So, in that case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of the coefficients of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't make sense because the coefficient would then be a polynomial in \\(c\\), not a single number. Alternatively, maybe the question is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that would be 6 times \\(2^6\\), since the sum of coefficients in a binomial expansion \\((x + y)^n\\) is \\(2^n\\). So, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) has sum of coefficients equal to \\(2^6 = 64\\). So, 6 times 64 is 384. So, the coefficient would be 384. But wait, is that correct? Let me check again. Alternatively, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Maybe it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning that the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out, so that the term is just \\(a^2b^2\\). That would make sense because otherwise, the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\), which seems unlikely. So, if that's the case, then I need to find the term where in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, so that when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), the term is \\(a^2b^2\\). So, let's approach it this way. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\) with coefficient 6, as we found. Now, in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. So, let me expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem. It would be \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, we need the exponent \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which implies \\(k = 3\\). So, the term where \\(k = 3\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} c^{0} = \\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Therefore, when we multiply the two expansions, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by 20, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Wait, that makes sense. So, the coefficient is 120. Let me double-check to make sure I didn't make a mistake. So, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). In \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term with \\(c^0\\) is when \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), so \\(k = 3\\), and the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, multiplying 6 and 20 gives 120. That seems correct. I think that's the right answer.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplying it by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20. Thus, the final coefficient is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\boxed{120}"

So, the coefficient is 6. Now, the expression also has another part: \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I wonder if I need to expand this part as well. Wait, the problem is only asking about the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which are variables in the first part. The second part involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), so maybe the coefficients from the second part don't affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)? Let me think. When you multiply two expressions together, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all terms in the second part, but since the second part doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), maybe it just gets multiplied as a whole.

Wait, no, that's not correct either. Actually, when you multiply two expressions, each term from the first is multiplied by each term from the second, but since \\(a^2b^2\\) is only from the first part, the second part can contribute any term, but since we're not interested in \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), we just need the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and then multiply it by the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Wait, but that's not quite right. Let me think again. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the powers of \\(c\\), it's actually the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients in the second part. Wait, but that's not correct. Because when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficients multiply term by term. So, if I have \\( (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{i} c_i a^{4 - i}b^i \\) and \\( \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{j} d_j c^{6 - j} \\), then the product is \\( \\sum_{i,j} c_i d_j a^{4 - i}b^i c^{6 - j} \\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would come from when \\(4 - i = 2\\) and \\(i = 2\\), which gives \\(c_2 = 6\\) as before. Then, for each term in the second part, \\(d_j\\) is the coefficient of \\(c^{6 - j}\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since we're not interested in any specific power of \\(c\\), but just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is combined with all possible powers of \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be \\(6 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, no, that's not correct either. Because when you multiply, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be \\(6\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but since we're just looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), we need to consider that the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by every term in the second expansion, each contributing their own coefficients. But since \\(a^2b^2\\) is in the first part, and the second part doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be \\(6 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that seems to include \\(c\\) terms, which we don't want. Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try another approach. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so it's just the coefficient from the first part, because the second part doesn't affect \\(a\\) or \\(b\\). So, perhaps the coefficient is just 6, regardless of the second part. But that doesn't make sense because the second part is multiplied by the first part. Wait, no, because in the product, each term from the first part is multiplied by each term from the second part. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by every term in the second part. But since we're just looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is independent of \\(c\\), we need to find the sum of all coefficients from the second part that are multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). But actually, the \\(c\\) terms are separate, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Wait, that makes more sense. Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, each term contributes its coefficient, so the total coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) would be \\(6 \\times \\left(\\text{sum of all coefficients in the second expansion}\\right)\\). So, what's the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)? To find the sum of coefficients, we can set \\(c = 1\\). So, \\(\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = (2)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). Wait, but I'm not sure if that's correct. Let me think again. Alternatively, maybe the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just 6, because the second part doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. But that can't be right because the entire expression is a product, so the coefficients would multiply. Wait, no, the second part is being multiplied as a whole, so each term in the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 multiplied by each term in the second expansion, but since we're just looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is independent of \\(c\\), the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. So, as I calculated before, that would be 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try to think differently. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). To find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I can treat the two parts separately because they involve different variables. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6, and since the second part is multiplied by this, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. But since we're just looking for the coefficient, not the term, we need to consider that each term in the second part contributes to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, no, because the second part doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), so when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by the second part, each term in the second part is just a coefficient multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), so the total coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Therefore, the sum of coefficients in the second part is when \\(c = 1\\), which is \\(2^6 = 64\\). So, 6 * 64 = 384. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 384. Wait, but let me check this again. Alternatively, maybe I should consider that the second part is a separate polynomial, and when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficients multiply. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) (since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\)) in the second part is the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, maybe I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part and then multiply it by 6. Let me try that approach. So, to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), I can use the binomial theorem. The expansion is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(k = 3\\). So, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 * 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the second part) = 120. Wait, that contradicts my earlier conclusion of 384. Hmm, so which one is correct? Let me think carefully. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product. So, the entire product is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When you expand this, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second part. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), we need to find all the terms in the second part that, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), result in a term that doesn't have any \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\). That is, we need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so that when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), it remains \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part. So, that would be 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the correct coefficient is 120. So, my initial approach was wrong because I thought to multiply by the sum of all coefficients, but actually, we need to multiply by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\), which is 20. That makes more sense because only the term with \\(c^0\\) will keep the term as \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) involved. So, the correct answer should be 120. Let me double-check this. The first part: \\((a + b)^4\\), coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. The second part: \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Therefore, 6 * 20 = 120. Yes, that seems correct.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break it down into two parts:\n\n1. **First Part: \\((a + b)^4\\)**\n   - Using the binomial theorem, the expansion is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\\).\n   - The term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\), so the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n\n2. **Second Part: \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)**\n   - We need the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) (since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\)).\n   - Using the binomial theorem, the expansion is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\).\n   - The term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0 occurs when \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), so \\(k = 3\\).\n   - The coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n\n3. **Combining Both Parts:**\n   - The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficients from both parts: \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

    "text": " So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Let me compute that: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient is 6. Now, the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which only involves \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), not \\(c\\). So, does that mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just 6 times whatever is in front of \\(c^0\\) in the second part? Because if I multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), I need to find the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero to get a constant term, so that when I multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by that term, it's just \\(a^2b^2\\) times a constant. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, let me figure out what the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Again, I can use the binomial theorem here. \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, I need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be zero. So, set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), I get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). So, the term where \\(m = 3\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} c^{0}\\), which is just \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, 6! is 720, and 3! is 6, so 720/(6*6) is 720/36, which is indeed 20. So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the second part), so 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient is 120. Wait, but let me double-check. So, in the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6. Then, in the second part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. So, when we multiply the two expressions, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part gets multiplied by the constant term 20 from the second part, resulting in \\(a^2b^2 \\times 20\\), so the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120. That seems right. Wait, but wait, I'm a bit confused because the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, when we expand both, each term in the first expansion gets multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, to get the term \\(a^2b^2\\), we need to take \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part and multiply it by the term in the second part that has \\(c^0\\), which is 20. So, yes, the coefficient would be 6 * 20 = 120. Alternatively, maybe I should think of the entire expression as a product, and the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the sum over all possible products where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) add up to 2 each, and the exponents of \\(c\\) add up to zero. But since the first part only has \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the second part only has \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), the exponents of \\(c\\) in the second part are separate from the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part, which is 6 * 20 = 120. That makes sense. So, I think the answer is 120.\n\nWait, but let me check my calculations again because I don't want to make a mistake.\n\nFirst, for \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Correct.\n\nNext, for \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term with \\(c^0\\) occurs when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, which happens when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), so \\(m = 3\\). The coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Correct.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 * 20 = 120. So, the final answer should be 120.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, maybe I can think about it differently. Let's consider the entire expression as a product of two independent expansions. So, when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each polynomial, provided that the variables don't interfere. Since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are in one part, and \\(c\\) is in the other, the variables are independent. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is just the product of the coefficients of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part. So, 6 * 20 = 120. Yep, that seems solid.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can write out the expansions more explicitly.\n\nFirst, expand \\((a + b)^4\\):\n\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\n\\]\n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6.\n\nNext, expand \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\):\n\nUsing the binomial theorem, as before, the term where \\(c^0\\) is when \\(m = 3\\), so the term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} c^{6 - 2*3} = 20 c^0 = 20\\).\n\nTherefore, when we multiply the two expansions, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion gets multiplied by 20, resulting in 6 * 20 = 120 as the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\).\n\nI think that's correct. So, the final answer is 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem.\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\):\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\n   \\]\n   So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\n2. **Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n   \\]\n   The term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero (i.e., \\(c^0\\)) occurs when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which gives \\(m = 3\\):\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{6}{3} c^0 = 20\n   \\]\n   So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20.\n\n3. **Combine the results:**\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficients from the two expansions:\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 20 = 120\n   \\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}."

    "text": " So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Let me calculate that: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient is 6. Now, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the second part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I think I need to expand this as well, but wait, since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), maybe the coefficient from the first part is all that matters? Hmm, wait, no. Because when you multiply two expressions together, each term in the first expansion gets multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but since we're only interested in the term \\(a^2b^2\\), and the other part doesn't affect it, maybe the coefficient is just 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part, but that doesn't make sense because the second part is in terms of \\(c\\). Wait, no, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think again. The problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term in the product of \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when you multiply the two expressions together, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all the terms in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that seems wrong because the terms in \\(c\\) don't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. Wait, maybe not. Wait, actually, when you multiply two polynomials, each term from the first polynomial is multiplied by each term from the second. But in this case, we're looking for a term that only has \\(a^2b^2\\), so the \\(c\\) terms must cancel out in such a way that they don't contribute to any \\(c\\) terms in the final product. But the problem only asks for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, perhaps the coefficient is just 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that doesn't make sense because the coefficient should be a number, not a polynomial. Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me try another approach. Maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, in other words, we can consider the entire product as a polynomial in \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\), and \\(1/c\\), and we're to find the coefficient of the term \\(a^2b^2\\) times any power of \\(c\\). But that doesn't make sense because the problem would have specified if it wanted a specific power of \\(c\\) as well. Wait, perhaps I misread the problem. Let me check again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, it's just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. That means that the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that can't be right because the coefficient should be a single number, not a polynomial. Wait, no, actually, when you multiply the two expressions, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part is multiplied by every term in the second part. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, that might be it. Because when you have \\(a^2b^2\\) times each term in the second expansion, the coefficient for each of those terms would be 6 times the coefficient from the second expansion. But since the problem just asks for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, that would mean adding up all those coefficients. But that seems a bit odd because the coefficient would then be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of the coefficients is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times 64, which is 384. Wait, but that seems high. Let me think again. Alternatively, maybe I'm supposed to consider that the \\(c\\) terms don't affect the \\(a^2b^2\\) term, so the coefficient is just 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that doesn't make sense because the coefficient should be a number, not a polynomial. Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me approach it differently. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When you multiply these two, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6\\(a^2b^2\\). Then, when you multiply this by each term in the second expansion, which is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. Because each term in the second expansion is a coefficient times some power of \\(c\\), and when multiplied by 6\\(a^2b^2\\), it becomes 6 times that coefficient times \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^k\\) or \\(c^{-k}\\). But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, the total coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. The sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is indeed found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 \u00d7 64 = 384. Wait, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe I'm supposed to consider that the \\(c\\) terms are separate, and the \\(a^2b^2\\) term is multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), so the coefficient is 6 times that expansion. But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, which doesn't make sense. So, I think the correct approach is that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, so 6 \u00d7 64 = 384. Therefore, the coefficient is 384.\n\nWait, but let me check again. Alternatively, maybe I should consider that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, meaning that the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any power of \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would indeed be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that can't be right because the coefficient should be a number, not a polynomial. So, perhaps the correct interpretation is that the problem wants the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times any power of \\(c\\), so the total coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, giving 384. Alternatively, maybe the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out. That would make more sense because then the coefficient would be a number. So, perhaps I need to find the term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) that has \\(c^0\\), i.e., the constant term, and then multiply that by 6. Let me try that approach. So, first, find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\). So, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, the constant term is 20. Then, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 \u00d7 20 = 120. Hmm, that seems more reasonable. So, perhaps I misinterpreted the problem earlier. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, but it's possible that it's considering only the constant term with respect to \\(c\\), meaning \\(c^0\\). So, the coefficient would be 6 \u00d7 20 = 120. Alternatively, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, then it would be 6 \u00d7 64 = 384. But I think the more likely interpretation is that it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), so the constant term. Therefore, the coefficient is 120. Let me confirm this by another approach. So, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\) with coefficient 6. Then, when multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the product will have a factor of \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by a term from the second expansion. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, giving 384. But if we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it's 6 \u00d7 20 = 120. I think the problem is more likely asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, so 384. But I'm a bit confused because usually, when you have multiple variables, the coefficient is considered in the entire expression, but in this case, since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), perhaps the coefficient is just 6 times the entire expansion of the second part, but that doesn't make sense because the coefficient should be a number. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, so 384. But I'm not entirely sure. Let me check an example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^1 \\times (c + 1/c)^1 = (a + b)(c + 1/c)\\). The coefficient of \\(a^1b^0\\) would be 1 times (c + 1/c), but that's a polynomial, not a number. So, perhaps in that case, the coefficient is the polynomial itself. But in the problem, it's asking for a coefficient, which should be a number. So, maybe the correct interpretation is that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, giving 384. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting me to consider that the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part, so the coefficient is 6 times that expansion, but that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, which doesn't make sense. Therefore, I think the correct approach is that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, so 6 \u00d7 64 = 384. But I'm still a bit uncertain because I'm not sure if the problem wants the coefficient considering all possible \\(c\\) terms or just the constant term. However, given that the problem specifies only \\(a^2b^2\\), without mentioning \\(c\\), I think it's safer to assume that it's asking for the coefficient regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which would be 384. Alternatively, if it's considering only the constant term in \\(c\\), it would be 120. I think I need to clarify this. Let me think about the structure of the product. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). When you expand this, each term will be of the form \\(a^kb^{4 - k} \\times c^m\\) where \\(m\\) ranges from -6 to 6. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be present in the product, but multiplied by various powers of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually be a polynomial in \\(c\\), with the coefficient being 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that can't be right because the problem is asking for a coefficient, which is a number. Therefore, perhaps the problem is expecting me to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where the exponents of \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are 2, 2, and 0 respectively. That would make the coefficient a single number. So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 (from \\(a^2b^2\\)) multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 20. So, 6 \u00d7 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient is 120. I think that's the correct approach because it results in a single numerical coefficient, which is what the problem is asking for. So, to summarize: The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product is 6 \u00d7 20 = 120. So, the final answer is 120.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion is 64, so 6 \u00d7 64 = 384. But now I'm thinking it's 120. Which one is correct? Let me check with specific values. Suppose I set \\(a = 1\\), \\(b = 1\\), \\(c = 1\\). Then the entire expression becomes \\((1 + 1)^4 \\times (1 + 1)^6 = 16 \u00d7 64 = 1024\\). Now, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be \\(1^2 \u00d7 1^2 = 1\\), and the coefficient would be 6 \u00d7 64 = 384, as per the first approach. But if I set \\(a = 1\\), \\(b = 1\\), \\(c = 1\\), then the entire expression is 1024, and the term \\(a^2b^2\\) times any \\(c\\) term would be 384. But if I set \\(c = 1\\), then the second expansion is 64, so the total expression is 16 \u00d7 64 = 1024, and the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 \u00d7 64 = 384. So, in this case, the coefficient is 384. But if I set \\(c = 1\\), the term \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) would be 120, as per the second approach. Wait, but when \\(c = 1\\), the entire expression is 1024, and the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is 384, which is part of that 1024. So, perhaps the first approach is correct, that the coefficient is 384. Alternatively, if I set \\(c = 1\\), the expression becomes \\((a + b)^4 \u00d7 64\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 \u00d7 64 = 384. Therefore, I think the correct answer is 384. So, where did I go wrong earlier when I thought it was 120? I think I confused the problem with finding the constant term in \\(c\\), but the problem doesn't specify that. It just asks for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of the second part, which is 64, so 384. Therefore, the final answer is 384.\n\nWait, but let me think again. The problem is written as \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, when you multiply these two, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by every term in the second part, which is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 times the entire expansion of the second part. But that can't be right because the coefficient should be a number, not a polynomial. Therefore, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), i.e., the term where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out. In that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion, which is 20, giving 120. So, which is it? I think the key is whether the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), or specifically \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). Since the problem doesn't specify \\(c\\), I think it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), which would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, giving 384. But I'm still a bit unsure. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and the second part is a separate expansion, so the coefficient remains 6. But that doesn't make sense because the entire expression is a product. Therefore, I think the correct approach is that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, so 384. Therefore, the final answer is 384.\n\nBut wait, let me check with specific values again. Suppose I set \\(a = 1\\), \\(b = 1\\), \\(c = 1\\). Then the entire expression is \\((1 + 1)^4 \u00d7 (1 + 1)^6 = 16 \u00d7 64 = 1024\\). The term \\(a^2b^2\\) is 1, and the coefficient is 384, as per the first approach. But if I set \\(c = 1\\), then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 384, which is part of the 1024 total. So, that seems correct. Alternatively, if I set \\(c = 1\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 384. So, I think that's the correct answer.\n\nWait, but I'm still a bit confused because I thought the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the entire expansion, but that's a polynomial. So, perhaps the problem is expecting me to consider that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, so 384. Therefore, the final answer is 384.\n\nBut to make sure, let me think about another example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^1 \u00d7 (c + 1/c)^1 = (a + b)(c + 1/c)\\). The coefficient of \\(a^1b^0\\) is 1 \u00d7 (c + 1/c) = c + 1/c. But that's a polynomial, not a number. So, perhaps in that case, the coefficient is the polynomial itself. But in the problem, it's asking for a coefficient, which is a number, so perhaps the problem is expecting me to consider that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, giving 384. Therefore, I think the correct answer is 384.\n\nWait, but in the example I just thought of, the coefficient of \\(a^1b^0\\) is \\(c + 1/c\\), which is a polynomial. So, in that case, the coefficient isn't a number but a polynomial. Therefore, perhaps in the given problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the entire expansion of the second part, which is a polynomial, but the problem is asking for a number, so perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is written as \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), and it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of the second part, but that's a polynomial, not a number. Therefore, perhaps the problem is expecting me to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be a number. So, in that case, the coefficient is 6 \u00d7 20 = 120.\n\nI think I need to clarify this. Let me check the problem statement again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" It doesn't specify anything about \\(c\\), so perhaps it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which would mean that the coefficient is a polynomial. But the problem is asking for a coefficient, which is usually a number, so perhaps it's expecting me to consider the term where \\(c\\) cancels out, i.e., \\(c^0\\). Therefore, the coefficient is 6 \u00d7 20 = 120. I think that's the correct interpretation.\n\nSo, to summarize: The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product is 6 \u00d7 20 = 120.

    "text": " So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Let me calculate that: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient is 6. Now, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so maybe I don't need to worry about the other part? Hmm, but wait, no, because the entire expression is the product of these two expansions, so to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I need to consider how it interacts with the other expansion. Wait, no, actually, the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are in the first part, and \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) are in the second part. So, the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from those involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). That means, when we multiply the two expansions together, the terms from the first expansion (involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\)) are multiplied by terms from the second expansion (involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\)). But since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) (since \\(1/c^0 = 1\\)) in the second part. Wait, is that correct? Let me think. Because when you multiply two polynomials, each term from the first polynomial is multiplied by each term from the second polynomial. But in this case, since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are only in the first part, and \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) are only in the second part, the only way to get a term with \\(a^2b^2\\) is to take the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part and multiply it by the constant term (i.e., the term with \\(c^0\\)) from the second part. Because if you take any term from the second part that has \\(c^k\\) or \\(1/c^k\\), then the resulting term would have \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2/c^k\\), which are not just \\(a^2b^2\\). So, to get the pure \\(a^2b^2\\) term, you have to multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by the constant term from the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part (which is 6) multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part. So, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me work on that. Again, using the binomial theorem, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying the exponents, that's \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m} = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, each term has an exponent of \\(6 - 2m\\). I need the term where the exponent is 0, because that's the constant term. So, set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Let me compute that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6*6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the second part), which is 6*20=120. Wait, let me double-check that. So, in the first part, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6, and in the second part, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. When you multiply these two, you get 120, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 120. Hmm, that seems right. Alternatively, maybe I can think of it another way. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), the terms in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) don't affect the terms in \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just the coefficient from the first expansion times the coefficient of the constant term in the second expansion, which is exactly what I did. So, I think 120 is the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Multiplying these gives 6 * 20 = 120.\n\n\\(\\boxed{120}\\)"

But wait, since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which comes from the first part, and the second part is multiplied by that, does that mean the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just 6 times whatever the coefficient is from the second part?

So, actually, when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, but since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, we can treat the second part as a constant with respect to \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). Wait, no, that doesn't make sense because the second part isn't a constant; it's another expansion. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), it's possible that we're considering the expression as a product, and we're only interested in the part that contributes to \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. Wait, but that might not be the case because the entire expression is a product, so each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. However, since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, perhaps we can separate the two parts. Let me think: The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since we're only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), the terms involving \\(c\\) don't affect the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, that doesn't seem right. Let me clarify: When you have two polynomials multiplied together, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum of the products of coefficients of terms whose exponents add up to that term. But in this case, since we're looking for \\(a^2b^2\\), and the second polynomial involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), which don't affect the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, that can't be, because the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) has multiple terms, each of which would multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, no, because each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) has a coefficient, and when you multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), each of those coefficients would contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 (from \\((a + b)^4\\)) multiplied by the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\). So, let me compute that: \\(\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, does that mean the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 * 64 = 384? Wait, but that seems high. Let me think again. Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term in the product of the two expressions, and since \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), and the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) exponents, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. But actually, no, because each term in the second expansion is multiplied by each term in the first. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the sum of all coefficients in the second part, because each term in the second part is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the sum of coefficients in the second part is indeed 64, as I calculated before, so the total coefficient would be 6 * 64 = 384. But wait, that seems too straightforward. Let me check with an example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^1 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, the coefficient of \\(a^1b^0\\) would be 1 (from the first part) multiplied by the sum of coefficients in the second part, which is \\((1 + 1)^1 = 2\\), so the coefficient would be 2. But if I expand it, \\((a + b)(c + 1/c) = a c + a/c + b c + b/c. So, the coefficient of \\(a\\) is c + 1/c, but if we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a\\), regardless of the c terms, it's just the coefficients from the second part, which are 1 and 1, so the coefficient of \\(a\\) is 2, which matches. So, in that case, it's correct. Similarly, in our problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 multiplied by the sum of coefficients in the second part, which is 64, giving 384. Therefore, the coefficient is 384. But wait, let me make sure. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which would mean that each term in the product that has \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by any power of \\(c\\) would contribute to the coefficient. But since the problem doesn't specify any particular power of \\(c\\), just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\), then yes, it's the sum of all coefficients from the second part times the coefficient from the first part. So, I think 384 is correct. But let me double-check my steps. First, \\((a + b)^4\\) has \\(a^2b^2\\) with coefficient 6. Then, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) has a sum of coefficients equal to \\(2^6 = 64\\). So, multiplying these together, 6 * 64 = 384. Yes, that seems right. Alternatively, if the problem had asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some specific \\(k\\), then we would have to find the specific coefficient in the second expansion corresponding to \\(c^k\\) and multiply it by 6. But since it's just \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\), it's the sum over all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64. Therefore, the final answer is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(2^6 = 64\\). Multiplying these together gives \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n\\boxed{384}"

Or maybe I need to consider the entire expansion? Hmm, let me think. Wait, no, actually, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product. So, I think I need to consider the entire expansion of both parts and then find the coefficient when multiplied together. Wait, but actually, no, because \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are only in the first part, and \\(c\\) is only in the second part. So, when we multiply the two expansions together, the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) will only come from the first part, and the terms involving \\(c\\) will come from the second part. So, since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), does that mean that I just need to multiply the coefficient from the first part by the entire expansion of the second part? Or maybe the coefficient is just the product of the coefficients from each part, since \\(a^2b^2\\) is independent of \\(c\\). Hmm, wait, that doesn't seem right because the second part is raised to the 6th power, which could have multiple terms. But actually, when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), it would be the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients from the second part, because each term in the second part is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\).

But that would mean the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which seems to not be a numerical coefficient. Hmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem.

But that seems like the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\). Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times some specific power of \\(c\\), but the problem doesn't specify. Wait, the problem just says the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so perhaps it's considering the entire product, and the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in the second expansion, but that doesn't make sense because the second expansion has terms with different powers of \\(c\\). Alternatively, maybe the problem is considering \\(a^2b^2\\) as a term, and the coefficient is 6 multiplied by the entire second expansion, but that would make the coefficient a polynomial, not a number. Hmm, perhaps I need to re-examine the problem.\n\nWait, maybe I misread the problem. It says, \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, the entire expression is a product of two polynomials. So, when you multiply them, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire second expansion, which is 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would make the coefficient a polynomial, which seems odd. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), that is, the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\), which is 1. So, perhaps the problem is implicitly asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion. That makes more sense. So, let me proceed under that assumption.\n\nSo, first, from the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, as I found earlier. Now, from the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\), because when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), it would give a term \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). So, let me expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem. The expansion is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying that, it's \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m} = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so we set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which gives \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\).\n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire product is the product of the coefficients from each part, which is 6 (from \\(a^2b^2\\)) multiplied by 20 (from \\(c^0\\)), so 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but let me double-check that. So, the first part gives 6 for \\(a^2b^2\\), and the second part gives 20 for \\(c^0\\). So, when you multiply these two parts together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part, including the \\(c^0\\) term, which is 20. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is indeed 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120.\n\nWait, but just to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Let me recap: the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 20, so the product is 120. That seems correct. Alternatively, if I didn't consider the \\(c^0\\) term, and just multiplied the entire second expansion by 6, that would give a polynomial, but since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term in the product, it's more accurate to consider the coefficient as 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\), which is 20, giving 120. So, I think that's the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem for both parts of the expression.\n\nFirst, consider the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n\\]\nThe term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\), so the coefficient is:\n\\[\n\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\n\\]\n\nNext, consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem:\n\\[\n\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n\\]\nWe need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, which occurs when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), giving \\(m = 3\\).

But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and the terms involving \\(c\\) don't affect the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), we can consider that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression will be the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and the sum of all terms in the second part. Wait, no, that's not quite right. Because when you multiply two polynomials, each term from the first polynomial is multiplied by each term from the second, but since we're looking for a specific term \\(a^2b^2\\), and the second polynomial only has terms in \\(c\\), the multiplication doesn't affect the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression will just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, that doesn't make sense because the expansion of the second part has multiple terms, but since we're just looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and the other terms don't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be the same as in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that's not correct either because when you multiply by each term in the second expansion, each term contributes to the overall coefficient. Wait, no, I think I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When you expand this, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product will be \\(6 \\times\\) the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that's not quite right because the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) would be found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). But actually, when we multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product will be \\(6 \\times 64\\), which is 384. But wait, that doesn't seem right because the second part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), and when you multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will have a coefficient of \\(6 \\times\\) each term's coefficient in the second expansion. But actually, no, because each term in the second expansion is a separate term, and when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each of those terms, each will contribute to the overall coefficient. But since we're just looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\), then the coefficient will be \\(6 \\times\\) the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. Because each term in the second expansion, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), will give a term that includes \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by a term in \\(c\\), but since the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, then the coefficient will be \\(6 \\times\\) the sum of the coefficients of the second expansion. Wait, but actually, no, that's not correct. Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, each term will be a separate term in the product, but the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is just the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2, regardless of the exponents of \\(c\\). So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is just the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the entire second expansion, but that doesn't make sense because the second expansion is a sum of terms with different powers of \\(c\\). Wait, maybe I'm confusing the problem. Let me think differently. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part, which is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, each term in the second part is of the form \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). Therefore, when we multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each of these terms, we get terms like \\(6 \\times \\dbinom{6}{m} a^2b^2 c^{6 - 2m}\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in other words, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the sum over all \\(m\\) of \\(6 \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}\\). Wait, but that's not quite right because each term in the product will have \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by a different power of \\(c\\), but since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), then the coefficient is just \\(6\\) times the sum of all the coefficients in the second expansion. The sum of the coefficients in the second expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), so \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). But wait, that seems high. Let me check my reasoning again. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think of the entire expression as a product of two independent expansions. The first expansion is \\((a + b)^4\\), which has the term \\(a^2b^2\\) with coefficient 6. The second expansion is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which when expanded has terms like \\(c^6, 6c^4, 15c^2, 20, 15c^{-2}, 6c^{-4}, c^{-6}\\). Each of these terms is multiplied by the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion. Therefore, in the product, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the sum of all the coefficients from the second expansion, because each term in the second expansion, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), will contribute to the overall coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). The sum of the coefficients in the second expansion is indeed \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\), so 6 times 64 is 384. Therefore, the coefficient is 384. But wait, let me double-check this because sometimes when you have multiple variables, the exponents can interfere, but in this case, since \\(c\\) is a separate variable, the exponents don't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. So, when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, each of those products will have \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by a term in \\(c\\), but the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms is just the sum of all the coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by 6. So, yes, 6 times 64 is 384. Therefore, the coefficient is 384.\n\nWait, but another thought: maybe I'm supposed to consider that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but in the entire expression, which includes all powers of \\(c\\). So, actually, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 multiplied by each coefficient in the second expansion. But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 times 64, which is 384.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, meaning regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, so the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which is 6*64=384.\n\nWait, but let me check with an example. Suppose I have (a + b)^1 * (c + 1/c)^1. Then, expanding, we get (a + b)(c + 1/c) = ac + a/c + bc + b/c. The coefficient of a^1b^0 would be c + 1/c, but if we're looking for the coefficient of a^1b^0 regardless of c, it's just the sum of coefficients, which is 2. So, in that case, the coefficient of a^1 would be 2. Similarly, in our problem, the coefficient of a^2b^2 would be 6 times the sum of coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6*64=384.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should think of it as the product of the two expansions, so the coefficient of a^2b^2 is 6 times the sum over m of \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\), which is 6*64=384.\n\nWait, but another way to think about it is that since the two parts are multiplied together, and the exponents of a and b are independent of c, the coefficient of a^2b^2 is just the coefficient from the first part times the sum of coefficients from the second part. So, 6*64=384.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is more straightforward: since the two parts are multiplied, the coefficient of a^2b^2 is the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the entire second expansion. But since we're only interested in the coefficient, it's 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6*64=384.\n\nWait, but let me confirm by considering specific terms. Let's say in the first expansion, the term is 6a^2b^2. In the second expansion, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6-2m}\\). So, when multiplied, each term becomes 6a^2b^2 * \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6-2m}\\). Therefore, in the product, the term a^2b^2 is multiplied by each of these coefficients, so the coefficient of a^2b^2 in the entire product is the sum over m of 6 * \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\). Since \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} = 2^6 = 64\\), the total coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So, the coefficient is 384.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Another approach: when you have two polynomials multiplied together, the coefficient of a specific term in one polynomial is multiplied by the entire other polynomial. So, in this case, the coefficient of a^2b^2 in (a + b)^4 is 6, and when multiplied by the entire expansion of (c + 1/c)^6, which has a sum of coefficients equal to 64, then the coefficient of a^2b^2 in the product is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nSo, after going through this reasoning, I believe the coefficient is 384.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{384}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem.\n\nFirst, consider the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n\\]\nThe term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\), so the coefficient is:\n\\[\n\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\n\\]\n\nNext, consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem:\n\\[\n\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n\\]\nThe sum of the coefficients in this expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives:\n\\[\n(1 + 1)^6 = 64\n\\]\n\nSince the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 64, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is:\n\\[\n6 \\times 64 = 384\n\\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{384}."

So, the term is \\(6a^2b^2\\). \n\nNow, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Since multiplication is involved, I think the coefficients from both expansions will multiply together, but I need to check if the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are independent of the terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). Since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\), and \\(1/c\\) are all different variables, their exponents don't interfere with each other. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression will be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the coefficient from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) for any term in that expansion. Wait, but the problem only asks for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, maybe I don't need to worry about the specific term in the second expansion because the question is only about \\(a^2b^2\\). So, perhaps the coefficient is just 6 multiplied by whatever the coefficient is in the second expansion for any term, but I'm not sure. Wait, no, that might not be correct. Wait, no, actually, when you multiply two expressions, the coefficients multiply for the corresponding terms. But since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by every term in the second expansion. So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be \\(6\\) times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. But wait, that doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\). Wait, no, actually, when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first part, and it's multiplied by each term in the second part, which are terms involving \\(c^k\\) and \\(1/c^k\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in effect, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is \\(6\\) times the sum of all coefficients in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), because each term in the second expansion contributes a coefficient that multiplies with 6. But wait, no, that's not quite right because the question is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and since \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) are separate variables, each term in the product would be \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2 \\cdot 1/c^k\\), so the coefficient for each of those terms would be \\(6\\) times the corresponding coefficient from the second expansion. But if the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\), then maybe we need to sum all those coefficients. Wait, that seems a bit unclear. Let me think again. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, which would include all possible terms with \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by any power of \\(c\\). But that might not be the case. Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Maybe the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of the other variables. So, in that case, the coefficient would be the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the sum of all coefficients from the second part. Because when you multiply by each term in the second expansion, each term's coefficient gets multiplied by 6, and since the question is about the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is present in each of those products, the total coefficient would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion. But the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of the coefficients is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 * 64 = 384. But wait, that seems high. Let me check that again. Alternatively, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, considering all possible terms, which would indeed be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. So, 6 * 64 = 384. But let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. Alternatively, maybe the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without considering the other variables, which would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6*64=384. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is more straightforward, and I'm overcomplicating it. Wait, let me try another approach. Let's first expand \\((a + b)^4\\) and get the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is 6, as we found before. Now, the second part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), can be expanded using the binomial theorem as well. The expansion is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(1/c\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). Each term in this expansion has a coefficient of \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}\\) and a power of \\(c\\) as \\(c^{6 - 2k}\\). Now, when we multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, resulting in terms like \\(6a^2b^2c^{6 - 2k}\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. The sum of all coefficients in the second expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, the coefficient would be 6 * 64 = 384. Wait, but that seems correct because each term in the second expansion contributes its own coefficient when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), and since the question is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), we have to sum all those contributions. Therefore, the coefficient is indeed 384. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which would be the same as the coefficient in the first part, because the second part doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. But that doesn't make sense because the second part is being multiplied, so each term in the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part, but the coefficients multiply. Wait, no, that's not correct. Let me think again. When you have two polynomials multiplied together, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum of the products of the coefficients of terms whose variables multiply to give that specific term. But in this case, the variables \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are all separate, so the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be the product of \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part and any term from the second part. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which is 64. So, 6 * 64 = 384. Therefore, the coefficient is 384. Wait, but let me check if that's correct. Alternatively, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem, and it's only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), that is, the term where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out. If that's the case, then I would need to find the term in the second expansion where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, which would be when \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Then, the coefficient from the second expansion for that term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 * 20 = 120. Hmm, that makes more sense because 120 is a more reasonable number. But the problem didn't specify anything about \\(c\\), so I'm confused. Wait, let me read the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in other words, we need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for any integer \\(k\\). But in that case, the coefficient would be the coefficient from the first part, 6, multiplied by the sum of all coefficients from the second part, which is 64, giving 384. But if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without any restriction on \\(c\\), then it's 384. Alternatively, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by \\(c^0\\), then it's 120. Hmm, I think I need to clarify this. Let me check the problem statement again: It says, \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, it's just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would indeed be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, so 6*64=384. But let me think again. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by any power of \\(c\\), but since \\(c\\) is a separate variable, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be the sum of all terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any power of \\(c\\). So, each of those terms would have a coefficient of 6 times the corresponding coefficient from the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6*64=384. So, I think that's the correct approach. Therefore, the coefficient is 384. But wait, let me double-check. Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think of it as a product of two polynomials. The first polynomial is \\((a + b)^4\\), which has terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the second is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which has terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). When you multiply them, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second, so the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first will be multiplied by each term in the second, resulting in terms like \\(6a^2b^2c^{6}\\), \\(6a^2b^2c^{4}\\), etc. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^{6}\\) is 6, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^{4}\\) is 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^4\\) in the second expansion, which is \\(\\dbinom{6}{1}=6\\), so 6*6=36, and so on. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in effect, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion, each multiplied by 6. So, the sum of coefficients in the second expansion is 64, so 6*64=384. Therefore, the coefficient is 384. Alternatively, if the problem had asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), that would be different, but as it stands, it's just \\(a^2b^2\\), so 384 is correct. Wait, but let me think again. When you have two variables multiplied together, like \\(a^2b^2\\), and you're multiplying by another polynomial in \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would indeed be the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all coefficients in the second part, because each term in the second part adds a multiple of \\(a^2b^2\\) with different powers of \\(c\\). So, if you collect all the coefficients for \\(a^2b^2\\), you'd have 6 times each coefficient from the second expansion, summed together, which is 6 times 64, which is 384. So, I think that's the correct answer. Therefore, the coefficient is 384.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. Let me try a smaller example to check. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^1 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, expanding, we have \\((a + b)(c + 1/c)\\). The coefficient of \\(a^1b^0\\) in the first part is 1, and the sum of coefficients in the second part is \\((1 + 1) = 2\\), so the coefficient of \\(a\\) in the product would be 1*2=2. Indeed, when you expand, you get \\(ac + a/c + bc + b/c\\), so the coefficient of \\(a\\) is 1 for \\(ac\\) and 1 for \\(a/c\\), so total coefficient is 2, which matches. Similarly, the coefficient of \\(b\\) would be 2. So, this seems to confirm that the approach is correct. Therefore, in our original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6*64=384.\n\nBut wait, let me think again. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, but without considering the \\(c\\) terms, meaning that \\(c\\) must be raised to the zero power. That is, the term \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). In that case, we would need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion, which is when \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), so \\(k=3\\). The coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}=20\\). Then, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) would be 6*20=120. But the problem didn't specify anything about \\(c\\), so I think the correct interpretation is that it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), which would be 384. However, sometimes in problems, when they ask for the coefficient of a term involving multiple variables, they might be considering the term with all variables raised to specific powers, but in this case, it's only \\(a^2b^2\\), without any mention of \\(c\\). So, I think the correct answer is 384. But I'm a bit confused because 384 seems high, but in the smaller example, it worked out correctly. So, I think I'll go with 384 as the coefficient.\n\nWait, but let me check another way. Let's compute the entire product and see. The first part is \\((a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). The second part is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Let's compute that. The expansion is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^6 \\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - k}(1/c)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^6 \\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, the terms are:\n\n- \\(k=0\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{0}c^6 = 1 \\cdot c^6\\)\n- \\(k=1\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{1}c^{4} = 6c^4\\)\n- \\(k=2\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{2}c^{2} = 15c^2\\)\n- \\(k=3\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}c^{0} = 20\\)\n- \\(k=4\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{4}c^{-2} = 15c^{-2}\\)\n- \\(k=5\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{5}c^{-4} = 6c^{-4}\\)\n- \\(k=6\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{6}c^{-6} = 1c^{-6}\\)\n\nNow, when we multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, resulting in:\n\n- \\(6a^2b^2c^6\\)\n- \\(6a^2b^2c^4\\)\n- \\(6a^2b^2c^2\\)\n- \\(6a^2b^2\\)\n- \\(6a^2b^2c^{-2}\\)\n- \\(6a^2b^2c^{-4}\\)\n- \\(6a^2b^2c^{-6}\\)\n\nEach of these terms has a coefficient of 6 times the coefficient from the second expansion. So, the coefficients are:\n\n- \\(6 \\times 1 = 6\\)\n- \\(6 \\times 6 = 36\\)\n- \\(6 \\times 15 = 90\\)\n- \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\)\n- \\(6 \\times 15 = 90\\)\n- \\(6 \\times 6 = 36\\)\n- \\(6 \\times 1 = 6\\)\n\nNow, if we are to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, regardless of the power of \\(c\\), we need to sum all these coefficients because each term is \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by a different power of \\(c\\). So, adding them up: 6 + 36 + 90 + 120 + 90 + 36 + 6. Let's compute that:\n\n6 + 36 = 42\n\n42 + 90 = 132\n\n132 + 120 = 252\n\n252 + 90 = 342\n\n342 + 36 = 378\n\n378 + 6 = 384\n\nSo, the total coefficient is 384. That confirms my earlier calculation. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by considering the binomial expansions of each part. \n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\):** Using the binomial theorem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n\n2. **Sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\):** The sum of the coefficients is obtained by setting \\(c = 1\\), giving \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\).\n\n3. **Multiply the coefficients:** The total coefficient is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\(\\boxed{384}\\)."

    "text": " So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Let me compute that. \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient from the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), is 6 for \\(a^2b^2\\). Now, the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Hmm, so I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product of these two expansions. But wait, the first expansion only involves \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), while the second expansion involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, when I multiply them together, the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) will be multiplied by terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), that means we're looking for the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2 each, regardless of what's happening with \\(c\\). But wait, actually, when we multiply the two expressions, each term in the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by every term in the second expansion. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), that means we need to consider how many times \\(a^2b^2\\) appears when multiplied by terms from the second expansion. Wait, but actually, no, because each term from the first expansion is multiplied by each term from the second expansion. So, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product will be 6 multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But wait, no, that's not right. Because each term in the first expansion is being multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is just a scalar multiple (6) times the entire second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients of all terms in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But wait, that doesn't make sense because when you multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), it's just a scalar, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients of all terms in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But actually, no, because each term in the second expansion is a term involving \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), so when you multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), you get terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) and \\(a^2b^2c^{-k}\\), etc. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) itself would just be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in the second expansion because each term in the second expansion contributes a coefficient that gets multiplied by 6, and then the \\(a^2b^2\\) is just a constant factor. Wait, but actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, because each term in the second expansion is a term that, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), gives a term where the coefficient is 6 times the coefficient from the second expansion. But wait, that's not correct because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in the second expansion, because each term in the second expansion contributes a coefficient that, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), adds to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. But wait, that doesn't seem right because the second expansion is in terms of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), so when you multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), you get terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) and \\(a^2b^2c^{-k}\\), but the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) itself would be the sum of all the coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by 6. Wait, no, that's not correct. Because when you have \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by each term in the second expansion, each of those terms has a coefficient, and when you collect like terms, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. But actually, the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion is when \\(c = 1\\), so substituting \\(c = 1\\) into \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) gives the sum of the coefficients, which is \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times 64, which is 384. Wait, but that seems high. Let me double-check. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\), that term will be present in the product as \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is indeed 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. But the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), so \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, 6 * 64 = 384. So, the coefficient is 384. Wait, but let me think again. Alternatively, maybe I should consider that the second expansion is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which can be expanded using the binomial theorem as \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(1/c\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, each term in the second expansion is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). Therefore, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2 \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the sum over all \\(m\\) of \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} \\dbinom{6}{m}\\), because for each \\(m\\), the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} \\dbinom{6}{m}\\). Wait, but that would mean the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m}\\). But \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} = 2^6 = 64\\), so the coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384, as before. So, that seems consistent. Alternatively, maybe I should think about it differently. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). When expanding this, each term will be of the form \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k \\times \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m}(1/c)^m\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) occurs when \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\), as before. Then, the coefficient for each such term is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}\\), and the term will have \\(c^{6 - 2m}\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), the coefficient is the sum over all \\(m\\) from 0 to 6 of \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} \\dbinom{6}{m}\\). So, that's 6 times the sum of \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\) from \\(m=0\\) to 6, which is 6 * 64 = 384. Therefore, the coefficient is 384. Wait, but I'm a bit confused because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but in the entire product, each term involving \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by a term involving \\(c\\). So, does that mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is actually 6 times the entire expansion of the second part, meaning that the coefficient includes all the terms with different powers of \\(c\\)? But the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so it's just the scalar multiple in front of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. So, yes, 6 * 64 = 384. Therefore, the coefficient is 384. Wait, but let me check with a different approach. Maybe I can think of the entire expression as a product of two independent expansions. So, the first part gives \\(a^2b^2\\) with coefficient 6, and the second part is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which when expanded has terms from \\(c^6\\) down to \\(c^{-6}\\). So, when I multiply 6 by each term in the second expansion, I get 6 times each coefficient, and each of those is attached to \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. So, I think that's correct. Alternatively, maybe I should compute the entire expansion and see. But that would be time-consuming. Alternatively, maybe I can consider that the second expansion's coefficients sum up to \\(2^6 = 64\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 * 64 = 384. Therefore, the answer is 384. Wait, but let me check again. If I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = (1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 * 64 = 384. So, yes, that seems correct.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is found by expanding each part separately and then combining the results. \n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term with \\(a^2b^2\\) occurs when \\(k = 2\\):\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} a^{2}b^{2} = 6a^2b^2\n   \\]\n\n2. **Consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   The sum of the coefficients in this expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\):\n   \\[\n   \\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\n   \\]\n\n3. **Combine the results:**\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is:\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 64 = 384\n   \\]\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{384}\\)."

So, the coefficient from the first part is 6.\n\nNow, the expression is the product of two parts: \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but wait, the second part involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). Does that affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)? Hmm, maybe not directly, because \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\). So, when I multiply the two expressions together, the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) will be multiplied by terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), but since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I think I can treat the second part as a constant with respect to \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). That is, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the entire second part evaluated at the terms that don't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\). Wait, no, that's not quite right. Wait, no, actually, when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. So, in this case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all the terms in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that can't be right because then it would be a sum of terms involving \\(c\\), but the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term without \\(c\\). Wait, so maybe I'm misunderstanding something here. Let me think again.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when I expand this product, each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), that would come from the term where in \\((a + b)^4\\), we have \\(a^2b^2\\), and in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we have a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), because \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term without \\(c\\). Wait, but actually, no, because when you multiply, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), that would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that would make the coefficient a sum involving \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. Wait, perhaps I'm misinterpreting the problem.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). But that can't be because when you multiply by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term will have some power of \\(c\\). So, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), because that would be the term without any \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), which is possible. Let me check that.\n\nSo, if that's the case, then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). That makes sense because when you multiply the two expansions, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part would be multiplied by the constant term (i.e., \\(c^0\\)) from the second part, giving \\(a^2b^2 \\times\\) constant. So, that would be the term we're interested in.\n\nSo, first, let me find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which as I calculated earlier is 6.\n\nNext, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me think about how to approach this. Again, using the binomial theorem, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k\\). Simplifying each term, that's \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\).\n\nNow, we want the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so we set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Let me compute that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\).\n\nSo, the coefficient from the second part is 20.\n\nNow, since the two parts are multiplied together, the overall coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) (which is just \\(a^2b^2\\)) is the product of the two coefficients: 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, that seems straightforward, but let me double-check to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nSo, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n\nIn \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the expansion is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, when \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), \\(k = 3\\), and the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n\nMultiplying these together, 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not missing anything. Is there any other term in the expansion that could contribute to \\(a^2b^2\\) when multiplied by a term from the second part? For example, if the second part had a term with \\(c^1\\) or \\(c^{-1}\\), would that affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the overall expression? Hmm, no, because \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term without \\(c\\), so it can only be formed by multiplying \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part with the constant term \\(c^0\\) from the second part. Any other term from the second part would introduce a power of \\(c\\), which would make the term have \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), which isn't part of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, yes, I think that's correct.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the coefficient is 120.\n\nWait, but let me check once more to be thorough. Let's consider the entire expansion.\n\nThe first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), when expanded, is \\(a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\).\n\nThe second part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), when expanded, has terms like \\(c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15c^{-2} + 6c^{-4} + c^{-6}\\).\n\nSo, when we multiply these two expansions together, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second part, giving terms like \\(6a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(6a^2b^2c^4\\), etc., up to \\(6a^2b^2c^{-6}\\). But the only term that would result in \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) is when we multiply \\(6a^2b^2\\) by the constant term \\(20\\) from the second part, giving \\(6 * 20 a^2b^2 = 120a^2b^2\\).\n\nTherefore, the coefficient is indeed 120.\n\nWait, just to make sure, let me think if there's another way this could be approached. Maybe using multinomial coefficients or something else, but I think the approach I took is correct. Using the binomial theorem on both parts and then identifying the relevant terms is the standard way to handle such problems.\n\nSo, yeah, I think I'm confident that the coefficient is 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem for both parts of the expression.\n\n1. **Expanding \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\), so the coefficient is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\n   \\]\n\n2. **Expanding \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n   \\]\n   We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, which occurs when \\(6 - 2k = 0\\).

But wait, that doesn't make sense because the second part is a separate variable. So, actually, maybe the second part doesn't affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Because when you multiply, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will be multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part, but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), the second part can be considered as a constant factor, right? So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would just be 6 multiplied by the sum of the coefficients in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But wait, that doesn't sound right because each term in the second expansion is a different power of \\(c\\), so when you multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), each term would have a different power of \\(c\\). But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, maybe I'm overcomplicating this.\n\nWait, no. Let me think again. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product. So, perhaps the second part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), can be expanded, and when multiplied by the first part, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second. But since we're looking for \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), that term must come from the product of the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first part and the constant term (i.e., \\(c^0\\)) in the second part. So, the coefficient would be the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part. That makes more sense.\n\nSo, let me check that. So, the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), has a term \\(6a^2b^2\\). The second part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), when expanded, has a term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. That would be the constant term. So, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\).\n\nTo find that, I can use the binomial theorem again. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(1/c\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, we need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. That is, \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\).\n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). Wait, that seems correct because I know that \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficients from the first and second parts, which is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let me go through it again. The first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), has the term \\(a^2b^2\\) with coefficient 6. The second part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), has the term \\(c^0\\) with coefficient 20. So, when we multiply these two expressions together, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part, including the term with \\(c^0\\), which is 20. So, the term \\(6a^2b^2 \\times 20c^0 = 120a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120.\n\nWait, but let me check if there's another way to think about this. Maybe I can consider the entire expression as a product and see if I can combine the expansions. But I think the way I did it before is correct because we're looking for a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), so only the constant term from the second expansion would contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\).\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of the entire expression as \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of terms from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), and since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), the only term that affects it is the constant term in the second expansion. So, yes, that would be 20, and then multiplied by 6 gives 120.\n\nWait, another way to think about it: when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum of the products of coefficients of terms whose exponents add up to that specific term. But in this case, since we're looking for \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), the only way to get that is by taking the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first polynomial and the constant term from the second polynomial. So, yes, that would be 6 times 20, which is 120.\n\nWait, but let me make sure that I'm not missing any other terms. For example, could there be a term in the second expansion that, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), gives another term that somehow combines with \\(a^2b^2\\)? But no, because \\(a^2b^2\\) is a separate variable from \\(c\\), so the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is by multiplying \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part with the constant term from the second part. Any other term from the second part would introduce a power of \\(c\\), which would make the term \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) where \\(k\\) is non-zero, which is not what we're looking for.\n\nSo, I think I'm confident that the coefficient is 120.\n\nWait, but just to be thorough, let me compute the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) and see if the constant term is indeed 20.\n\nUsing the binomial theorem: \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\times (1/c)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\).\n\nSo, when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), \\(m = 3\\), so the term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} c^0 = 20\\). So yes, that's correct.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times 20, which is 120.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Is there a possibility that I'm supposed to consider other terms in the expansion that might affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)? For example, if the second expansion had terms that could combine in a way that affects the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but I don't think so because \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\). So, any term involving \\(c\\) would not affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\).\n\nTherefore, I think the answer is 120.\n\nBut wait, just to make sure, let me compute the entire product's expansion up to the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. So, the first part is \\((a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). The second part is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15/c^2 + 6/c^4 + 1/c^6\\). Now, when I multiply these two, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second part. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 multiplied by each coefficient in the second part, but only the constant term (20) would result in a term without any \\(c\\) exponents. All other terms would result in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), etc., which aren't \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the only contribution to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is from the constant term, which is 20, so 6 times 20 is 120.\n\nWait, but hold on, that's not correct because when you multiply \\(6a^2b^2\\) by the entire second expansion, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would actually be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, because each term in the second expansion would multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) and contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\). But wait, no, because \\(a^2b^2\\) is being multiplied by each term in the second expansion, which has different powers of \\(c\\). So, the only term that would result in a pure \\(a^2b^2\\) term is when you multiply by the constant term in the second expansion, which is 20. So, the coefficient would be 6 times 20, which is 120.\n\nWait, but if I consider that the entire second expansion has a sum of coefficients equal to \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\), because if I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(1 + 1/1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion is 64. But that's the sum of all coefficients, including those multiplied by \\(c^6\\), \\(c^4\\), etc. But in our case, we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). Wait, no, actually, no. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\). So, in the product, \\(a^2b^2\\) can only come from multiplying \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part by the constant term in the second part. So, the coefficient is 6 times 20, which is 120.\n\nWait, but let me think differently. Suppose I consider the entire product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). If I want the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), it's the same as taking the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and multiplying it by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), that would mean that the coefficient is 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. But wait, that can't be right because the sum of coefficients in the second expansion is 64, and 6 times 64 is 384, which is way too big. So, that approach must be wrong.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm confusing the way the coefficients interact. Let me clarify: when you have two polynomials multiplied together, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum of the products of the coefficients of terms in each polynomial whose exponents add up to that specific term. But in this case, the specific term is \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\). So, the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is by multiplying \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first polynomial by a term that has \\(c^0\\) from the second polynomial. Therefore, the coefficient is 6 (from the first polynomial) multiplied by 20 (from the second polynomial), giving 120.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So, I think the correct coefficient is 120.\n\nWait, but let me check another way. Let's compute the product step by step.\n\nFirst, expand \\((a + b)^4\\):\n\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\n\\]\n\nNow, expand \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\):\n\n\\[\n\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15/c^2 + 6/c^4 + 1/c^6\n\\]\n\nNow, multiply these two expansions. The term \\(6a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be the sum of \\(6 \\times\\) each coefficient in the second expansion. But wait, no, because each multiplication would give a term like \\(6a^2b^2 \\times c^6\\), \\(6a^2b^2 \\times 6c^4\\), etc. But we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would come from the term where \\(c^0\\) is multiplied by \\(6a^2b^2\\). So, that's only one term: \\(6a^2b^2 \\times 20 = 120a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient is 120.\n\nWait, but if I consider all possible multiplications, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. But that's not correct because each term in the second expansion is a different power of \\(c\\), so when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), they produce different terms, not just \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) is by multiplying \\(a^2b^2\\) by the constant term in the second expansion. So, the coefficient is 6 times 20, which is 120.\n\nI think I'm confident now that the coefficient is 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem for both parts of the expression.\n\n1. **Expanding \\((a + b)^4\\)**:\n   Using the binomial theorem, we have:\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\):\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\n   \\]\n   So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\n2. **Expanding \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)**:\n   Using the binomial theorem, we have:\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n   \\]\n   We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0:\n   \\[\n   6 - 2m = 0 \\implies m = 3\n   \\]\n   The coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\n   \\]\n\n3. **Combining the results**:\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficients from the two expansions:\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 20 = 120\n   \\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. \n\nBut wait, the original expression isn't just \\((a + b)^4\\); it's multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I need to consider the entire expression. Let me write it out: \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Now, when you multiply two expressions together, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression. But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), maybe I don't need to consider all the terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). Instead, I can focus on the part of the expression that contributes to \\(a^2b^2\\). \n\nWait, but actually, when you multiply the two expressions, any term in \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by any term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). However, since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are independent of the terms involving \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression will be the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, that doesn't make sense because the variables are different. Let me think again.\n\nActually, no, that's not quite right. Because when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second, but since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are different variables, the only way a term in the product will have \\(a^2b^2\\) is if it comes from multiplying the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in \\((a + b)^4\\) by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that can't be right because \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is another binomial expression, so maybe I need to consider it separately.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me clarify: the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are different variables, the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are independent of the terms involving \\(c\\). Therefore, when you multiply the two expressions, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) will be the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but since \\(c\\) terms don't affect \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), perhaps the coefficient remains 6. Wait, that doesn't sound right.\n\nWait, no, actually, when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6\\(a^2b^2\\), and when you multiply it by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), you get 6\\(a^2b^2\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would include all the terms from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that doesn't seem right because the sum of coefficients in a polynomial is found by setting all variables to 1. So, for \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), if I set \\(c = 1\\), I get \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of coefficients is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times 64, which is 384. But that seems too high, and I'm not sure if that's correct.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me re-read it: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of the term that has both \\(a^2b^2\\) and some combination of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), but since the question doesn't specify any particular power of \\(c\\), maybe it's just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), not a single number. Hmm, that doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a coefficient, which is a number.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misinterpreting the problem. Maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some \\(k\\), but the problem doesn't specify. Alternatively, maybe it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that would make the coefficient a polynomial, not a single number. So, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, considering that the entire product is a polynomial in \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the term that's multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), which is the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient is 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that would make it a polynomial, not a single coefficient. So, perhaps the problem is expecting just the coefficient 6, but that seems too simple.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think again. When you have two separate variables, \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are in one part, and \\(c\\) is in another. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the \\((a + b)^4\\) part, and when you multiply by the other part, which is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, not a single number. However, the problem is asking for the coefficient, which is a number, so perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is written incorrectly, or perhaps I'm misinterpreting it. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where \\(c\\) cancels out to \\(c^0\\), which is 1. So, in that case, I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would involve both parts. So, let me try that approach.\n\nSo, to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), I need to consider both expansions: \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). From \\((a + b)^4\\), as before, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. Now, from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), I need the coefficient of \\(c^0\\), which is the constant term. Because when I multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by \\(c^0\\), I get \\(a^2b^2\\), which is what I'm looking for. So, I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nTo find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), I can use the binomial theorem again. The expansion is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We want the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\), which is \\(\\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20.\n\nNow, since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we multiply the coefficients from each part. So, 6 (from \\(a^2b^2\\)) times 20 (from \\(c^0\\)) gives 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought the problem was just asking for \\(a^2b^2\\), not necessarily with \\(c^0\\). But given that the problem is written as \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), and it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), perhaps it's considering all possible terms involving \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the coefficient should be a number. Therefore, perhaps the problem is indeed asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be 120. Alternatively, maybe the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, but then the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which would be a polynomial. But that seems unlikely because the problem is asking for a coefficient, which is a number. Therefore, I think the intended interpretation is that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nLet me double-check my steps. First, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. Then, in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the constant term is 20. Multiplying these together gives 6 * 20 = 120. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is 120. Since the problem didn't specify any \\(c\\) term, perhaps it's implied that we're looking for the term where \\(c\\) cancels out, i.e., \\(c^0\\). Therefore, the answer should be 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Multiplying these gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n$\\boxed{120}$"
